thought david suffering injury wisely let alone though occasionally gave cheering word frequently plied hot cocoa preferred much said coffee 
may seem rather incongruous way presenting religious secular things 
may careful preserve congruity dilute dish please palate fastidious 
world full incongruities endeavoring present portion consideration actually present time 
heartiest genial perhaps noisiest fisherman day man referred singing peter 
seemed intoxicated joy could refrain bursting song praise redeeming love 
peter means exclusive ideas
