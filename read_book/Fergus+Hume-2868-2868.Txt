difficult enough understand assassin could murdered bolton opened packing case removed mummy replace body victim house filled least half dozen people yet difficult guess criminal escaped noticeable object mummy bandaged emerald hued woollen stuff woven hair peruvian llamas 
culprit one thieved murdered gain could scarcely sell mummy without arrested since england ringing news disappearance scientist impelled robbery archaeological mania could possibly keep possession mummy without someone learning possessed 
meanwhile thief plunder vanished completely earth swallowed

plump little professor yet unsealed case pedro entered standing rubbing fat hands gloating expression face 
however cockatoo brought peruvian card braddock expected visitor wheeled face

dragged bohemian sort way attained marriageable age mother seemed wicked hard hearted forced marry comparatively wealthy man called jasher 
elderly husband jasher young treated wife badly infected spirit gambling father lost money 
mrs jasher went america performed stage order keep home together 
one child died much grief yet also much relief miserable poor 
mrs jasher gave scanty account sordid years trouble trial failure sorrow 
husband roamed america went australia new zealand lived wretched existence many years 
finally husband died strong drink advanced age leaving mrs jasher somewhat elderly widow 
poor woman took stage tried earn bread unsuccessful 
afterwards lectured 
kept boarding establishment finally went nurse 
every way would seem tried keep head water roamed world like bird passage finding rest nowhere sole foot 
yet throughout story young men could see always aspired quiet decent respectable existence force circumstances flung whirlpool life 
said remarked random stage miserable creature sinned sinning 
moral sense seemed become blunted however said archie doubtfully 
small wonder amidst surroundings seems much better circumstances many another woman would 
go 
melbourne mrs jasher made lucky speculation mines brought one thousand pounds 
came england resolved make bid respectability 
chance led neighborhood gartley thinking set tent locality might manage marry officer fort since amidst dismal surroundings young man might easily fascinated woman world took cottage amidst marshes small rent

afterwards met professor braddock determined marry man easy manage 
successful enlisting lucy side green mummy brought bad luck pyramids everything went capitally 
connection name bolton first mention made green mummy 
sidney clever young man although lowly born taken professor braddock assistant could hope day make position 
braddock educating although paid little way wages

unfortunately success plan mrs jasher thought professor would make distinguished husband betrayed sidney arranged 
beastly thing interrupted random disgusted

might remembered honor amongst thieves 
well dead poor soul said hope sigh 
god knows sinned paid cruelly sin remark sir frank silent resumed reading 
braddock furious learned assistant projected trickery determined circumvent 
agreed marry mrs jasher done could warned sidney could escaped mummy jewels conniving hervey 
professor could risk remembering hervey gustav vasa aware clever reckless 
whether braddock ever intended marry widow end hard say certainly pretended consent engagement mainly brought lucy 
came details murder far mrs jasher knew 
one evening fact evening crime committed woman walking garden late 
moonlight saw braddock cockatoo go along cinderpath jetty near fort 
wondering waited heard saw still moonlight come back long midnight 
next day heard murder guessed professor slave cockatoo little else rowed pierside boat strangled sidney stolen mummy
