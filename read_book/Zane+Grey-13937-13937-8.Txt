whipping wind swept across plain land 
sun pale bright east slowly obscured gray clouds 
snow began fall first scudding scanty flakes increasing air full great fleecy swirl 
wade rode along rim mountain wall watching beautiful snow storm falling brown gulf beneath

frosts came late leaves gradually change green 
one day magic gold among green another purple red 
hilltops blazed crowns aspen groves slopes sage shone mellow gray sunlight vines stone fences straggled away lines bronze patches ferns cliffs faded fast great rock slides black timbered reaches stood somber shades 
columbines bloomed dells among spruces beautiful stalks heavy blossoms sweetest palest blue white flowers 
motionless lifted faces light 
aspen groves grass turning gold columbines blew gracefully wind nodding swaying 
exquisite finest columbines hid shaded nooks star sweet silent gloom woods
