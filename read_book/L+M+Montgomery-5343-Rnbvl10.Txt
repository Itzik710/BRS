mrs west death occurred rosemary twenty fifth birthday bitter grief 
first intolerably lonely 
ellen especially continued grieve brood long moody musings broken fits stormy passionate weeping 
old lowbridge doctor told rosemary feared permanent melancholy worse 
ellen sat day refusing either speak eat rosemary flung knees sister side 
oh ellen yet said imploringly

love gone martin crawford deeps sea without love could marry one 
promised readily though ellen made rather fearsome rite 
clasped hands bible mother vacant room vowed would never marry would always live together 
ellen condition improved hour

must send away night send back lonely hearth empty life heart breaking problems promised ellen ten years mother bible would never marry 
john meredith immediately grasp opportunity 
contrary talked two good hours least lover like subjects 
even tried politics though politics always bored rosemary 
later began think altogether mistaken fears expectations suddenly seemed grotesque 
felt flat foolish 
glow went face lustre eyes 
john meredith slightest intention asking marry 
quite suddenly rose came across room standing chair asked 
room grown terribly still 
even st george ceased purr 
rosemary heard heart beating sure john meredith must hear 
time say gently firmly 
ready days stilted regretful little formula 
words completely vanished mind
