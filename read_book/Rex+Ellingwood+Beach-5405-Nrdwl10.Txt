kirk readily fell mood time reached water front laughing like two children 
stone arch went upon landing beneath sea wall 
front placid waters bay shimmering myriad small boats thronged harbor 
coasting steamers launches sail boats skiffs canoes 
along shore tide line rows schooners fashioned gigantic tree trunks capable carrying many tons squatting upon mud white sails raised dry like outstretched wings resting sea gulls 
landing thronged sight newcomers loiterers gathered sides pirate throng shouting dozen dialects forcing kirk battle lustily luggage 
stepping skiff rowed launch moments later gliding swiftly around long rock rib guards harbor copper hued bandit wheel nubian giant engine evil yellow faced desperado sprawling upon forward deck 
looking back saw city spread brilliant panorama clear beautiful morning radiance 
packed dense lay buttressed weather stained ramparts legend says built women husbands war backed green heights ancon foreign houses nestled

following gaze kirk beheld mountain amethyst rising bay 
behind shores stretched away misty distances low mountains softened delicate purple rolled jungle plain 
ahead turquoise waters dotted islets whose heights densely overgrown sands coral whiteness ringed shore lines 
fleet fishing boats drifted 
far roadstead lay two cruisers slate gray grim 
waters side purled soothingly heavens beamed breeze like gentle caress 
excursionists lost silent enjoyment 
even come anchor dozen boatmen racing crying patronage 
water edge saw tiny village nestled close mountains tiled roofs rust red grown moss walls faded wind weather delicate mauves dove colors greens impossible describe

sorry momentary madness behaved improperly toward woman owed much yet shown meanness ingratitude 
across meadows deep grass went skirting little ponds marshy spots growing cheerful every step

rejoiced thought successfully lost 
midday paused open glade hillside eat lunch

thousand voiceless tragedies enacted wood peopled distorted shapes spoke forgotten encounters rich riotous parasitic growths flourished upon starved limbs rotting trunks 
weird beautiful pitiless

brook dammed widened deep limpid pool clean white sand bottom lent golden hue 
lower end overflowed waterfall purling music filled glade
