course sally silenced us time 
remembered episode juncture pushed something noncommittal say inquired polite surprise married daughter living mr jacobus moved big hand right left quietly 
another girls stated ponderously breath usual 
seemed pause ransacking mind kind descriptive phrase 
hopes disappointed 
merely produced stereotyped definition 
different sort person 
indeed jacobus called brother day 
great compliment say found different sort person 
air profound reflection remarked quaintly man regular habits 
might alluding habit late siesta mumbled something beastly habits anyhow left store abruptly 
chapter iv little passage jacobus merchant became known generally 
one two acquaintances made distant allusions 
perhaps mulatto boy talked 
must confess people appeared rather scandalised jacobus brutality 
man knew remonstrated hastiness 
gave whole story visit forgetting tell tale resemblance wretched mulatto boy tormentor 
surprised 
doubt doubt 
jovial tone assured must many sort 
elder jacobus bachelor life 
highly respectable bachelor 
never open scandal connection 
life quite regular 
could cause offence one 
said offended considerably 
interlocutor opened wide eyes 
mulatto lad got knocks great affair surely 
idea insolent untruthful half castes 
fact seemed think mr jacobus rather kind otherwise employ youth sort amiable weakness could forgiven 
acquaintance mine belonged one old french families descendants old colonists noble impoverished living narrow domestic life dull dignified decay 
men rule occupy inferior posts government offices business houses 
girls almost always pretty ignorant world kind agreeable generally bilingual prattle innocently french english 
emptiness existence passes belief 
obtained entry couple households years bombay occasion use pleasant ineffectual young man rather stranded knowing even get home island 
matter two hundred rupees turned family made point showing gratitude admitting intimacy 
knowledge french language made specially acceptable 
meantime managed marry fellow woman nearly twice age comparatively well profession really fit 
cakes ale 
first time called couple spied little spot grease poor devil pantaloons made screaming scene reproaches full sincere passion sat terrified tragedy racine 
course never question money advanced sisters miss angele miss mary aunts families spoke quaint archaic french pre revolution period host distant relations adopted friend outright manner almost embarrassing 
eldest brother employed desk consignee office talk merchant jacobus 
regretted attitude nodded head sagely 
influential man 
one never knew one would need 
expressed immense preference shopkeeper two 
friend looked grave 
earth pulling long face cried impatiently 
asked see garden good mind go day 
said earnestly burst fit laughter looked without smile 
another matter altogether 
one time public conscience island mightily troubled jacobus 
two brothers partners years great harmony wandering circus came island jacobus became suddenly infatuated one lady riders 
made worse married 
even grace conceal passion 
must strong indeed carry away large placid creature 
behavior perfectly scandalous 
followed woman cape apparently traveled tail beastly circus parts world degrading position 
woman soon ceased care treated worse dog 
extraordinary stories moral degradation reaching island time 
strength mind shake free grotesque image fat pushing ship chandler enslaved unholy love spell fascinated listened rather open mouthed tale old world tale subject legend moral fables poems ludicrously failed fit personality 
strange victim gods meantime deserted wife died 
daughter taken care brother married advantageously possible circumstances 
oh mrs doctor exclaimed 
know yes 
able man 
wanted lift world good bit money mother besides expectations course know added 
doctor nods street believe avoids speaking meet board ship must happen sometimes 
remarked surely old story 
friend assented 
jacobus fault neither forgiven forgotten 
came back ultimately 
spirit contrition way propitiate scandalised fellow citizens 
must needs drag along child girl spoke daughter lives observed much interested 
certainly daughter circus woman said friend 
may daughter willing admit 
fact doubt see brought respectable community perpetuate memory scandal 
worst 
presently something much distressing happened 
abandoned woman turned 
landed mail boat claim child perhaps suggested 
friendly informant scornful 
imagine painted haggard agitated desperate hag 
cast mozambique somebody paid passage 
injured internally kick horse cent got ashore think even asked see child 
rate till last day life 
jacobus hired bungalow die 
got couple sisters hospital nurse months 
marry extremis good sisters tried bring even hear 
nuns said woman died impenitent 
reported ordered jacobus room last breath 
may real reason go mourning put child black 
little seen sometimes streets attended negro woman since became age put hair think set foot outside garden 
must eighteen 
thus friend added details think girl spoken three people position island elderly female relative brothers jacobus induced extreme poverty accept position gouvernante girl 
jacobus business certainly annoyed brother wise choice part 
brought contact strangers passage whereas would given rise sorts awkwardness social equals 
man wanting certain tact naturally shameless 
want keep girl painful everybody 
thought suddenly profound disgust jacobus could refrain saying slily suppose employed say scullion household occasionally pulled hair boxed ears position would regular less shocking respectable class belongs 
stupid miss intention shrugged shoulders impatiently 
understand 
begin mulatto 
scandal scandal 
people given chance forget 
dare say would better turned scullion something kind 
course trying make money every sort petty way business never enough anybody come forward 
friend left conception jacobus daughter existing lonely pair castaways desert island girl sheltering house cavern cliff jacobus going pick living beach exactly like two shipwrecked people always hope rescuer bring back last touch rest mankind 
jacobus bodily reality fit romantic view 
turned board usual course sipped cup coffee placidly asked satisfied hardly listened harbor gossip dropped slowly low voice saving enunciation

freya haunted like ubiquitous spirit woman world 
jasper remembered earnest recommendation guarded cautious acts words away 
quite unforeseen encounter felt ear breath hurried admonitions customary last moment partings heard half jesting final whisper mind kid never forgive quick pressure arm answered quiet confident smile
