ah worthy tribune even gods always grateful must case men true thankful 
unhappily old man mind weak darkened age disappointment reason grateful learned co religionists accuses conspired robbers says cause misfortunes

thou knowest lord surmises however would prevent summoning christians revenging cruelly 
would done undoubtedly others equal certainty would helped fortunately know name house prayer met notice

act thus 
suffices know ursus works near emporium miller named demas name borne thy freedman trusted slave thine may go morning track discover hiding place 
bring thee merely assurance since ursus divine lygia also rome second news ostrianum night almost certainly ostrianum interrupted vinicius wishing evidently run place indicated 
old hypogeum vi salaria nomentana 
pontifex maximus christians spoke thee expected somewhat later come night teach baptize cemetery 
hide religion though edicts prohibit yet people hate must careful 
ursus told last soul would ostrianum night every one wishes see hear foremost disciple christ call apostle 
since among women hear instruction well men pomponia alone perhaps women could explain aulus worshipper ancient gods absence home night 
lygia lord care ursus christian elders go undoubtedly women 
vinicius lived hitherto fever upheld hope alone hope seemed fulfilled felt weakness man feels journey proved beyond strength 
chilo noticed resolved make use

vinicius went casket called area standing marble pedestal taking purse threw chilo 
scrupula said lygia shall house thou wilt get full aurei

scruples shook purse outweighed mine mention thy society delight happiness 
vinicius interrupted impatiently asked details conversation ursus 
seemed clear either lygia hiding place would discovered night would able seize road back ostrianum 
thought vinicius borne away wild delight 
felt clearly sure finding lygia anger feeling offence almost vanished 
return delight forgave every fault 
thought dear desired impression returning long journey 
wished summon slaves command deck house garlands 
hour complaint ursus even 
ready forgive people everything 
chilo spite services felt hitherto certain repulsion seemed first time amusing also uncommon person 
house grew radiant eyes face became bright 
began feel youth pleasure life 
former gloomy suffering given yet sufficient measure loved lygia 
understood first time hoped possess 
desires woke earth warmed sun wakes spring desires time less blind wild joyous tender 
felt also within energy without bounds convinced see lygia eyes christians earth could take could c sar 
chilo emboldened young tribune delight regained power speech began give advice 
according behooved vinicius look affair observe greatest caution without work might end nothing 
implored vinicius carry lygia ostrianum 
ought go hoods heads faces hidden restrict looking present dark corner 
saw lygia would safest follow distance see house entered surround next morning daybreak take away open daylight 
since hostage belonged specially c sar might without fear law 
event finding ostrianum could follow ursus result would 
go cemetery crowd attendants impracticable might draw attention easily christians need put lights intercepted scatter darkness betake places known 
vinicius arm still better take couple strong trusty men defend case need 
vinicius saw perfect truth said recalling petronius counsel commanded slaves bring croton 
chilo knew every one rome set rest notably heard name famous athlete whose superhuman strength arena wondered declared would go ostrianum 
purse filled great aurei seemed much easier acquisition aid croton 
hence sat good spirits table time called chief atrium 
eating told slaves obtained master miraculous ointment

confusion rage laborer mention vinicius lygia left doubt persons concerned particularly laborer mentioned also penance killing man ursus killed atacinus finally appearance laborer answered perfectly account vinicius given lygian 
change name could provoke doubt chilo knew frequently christians took new names baptism 
ursus kill glaucus said chilo better still kill good sign show difficult christians murder 
described glaucus real son judas traitor christians eloquent stone would moved would promised fall head glaucus 
still hardly moved lygian bear put paw 
hesitated unwilling spoke penance compunction 
evidently murder common among 
offences one self must forgiven much freedom taking revenge others 
ergo stop think chilo threaten thee glaucus free avenge thee 
ursus kill glaucus great crime betrayal christians much kill thee small offence betraying one christian 
moreover pointed ardent wood pigeon nest turtle dove wash hands everything transfer naples 
christians talk also kind washing hands evidently method man affair may finish decisively 
good people christians ill men speak god justice world 
love religion since permit killing permit killing certainly permit stealing deceit false testimony hence say easy

ever property house like slaves numbers vinicius perhaps shall christian long may convenient 
rich man permit everything even virtue

fact began soon prepare darkness come world 
put gallic cloaks hoods took lanterns vinicius besides armed companions short curved knives chilo put wig obtained way old man shop went hurrying reach distant nomentan gate closed 
chapter xx went vicus patricius along viminal former viminal gate near plain diocletian afterward built splendid baths 
passed remains wall servius tullius places deserted reached via nomentana turning left towards via salaria found among hills full sand pits found graveyards 
meanwhile grown dark completely since moon risen yet would rather difficult find road christians indicated chilo foresaw 
fact right left front dark forms evident making way carefully toward sandy hollows 
people carried lanterns covering however far possible mantles others knowing road better went dark 
trained military eye vinicius distinguished movements younger men old ones walked canes women wrapped carefully long mantles 
highway police villagers leaving city took night wanderers evidently laborers going sand pits grave diggers times celebrated ceremonies night time 
proportion however young patrician attendants pushed forward lanterns gleamed number persons grew greater 
sang songs low voices vinicius seemed filled sadness 
moments separate word phrase song struck ear instance awake thou sleepest rise dead times name christ repeated men women 
vinicius turned slight attention words came head one dark forms might lygia 
passing near said peace thee glory christ disquiet seized heart began beat life seemed heard lygia voice 
forms movements like deceived darkness every moment corrected mistakes made repeatedly begin distrust eyes 
way seemed long 
knew neighborhood exactly could fix places darkness 
every moment came narrow passage piece wall booths remember vicinity city 
finally edge moon appeared behind mass clouds lighted place better dim lanterns 
something afar began last glimmer like fire flame torch 
vinicius turned chilo 
ostrianum asked 
chilo night distance city ghostlike forms made deep impression replied voice somewhat uncertain know lord never ostrianum 
might praise god spot nearer city 
feeling need conversation strengthening courage added come together like murderers still permitted murder unless lygian deceived shamefully 
vinicius thinking lygia astonished also caution mysteriousness co religionists assembled hear highest priest hence said like religions adherents midst us christians jewish sect 
assemble trans tiber temples jews take offerings daylight jews lord bitterest enemies 
heard present c sar time came war almost jews christians 
outbreaks forced claudius c sar expell jews present edict abolished 
christians however hide jews populace known thee accuse crimes hate 
walked time silence till chilo whose fear increased receded gates said returning shop euricius borrowed wig barber put two beans nostrils

went narrow depression closed two ditches side aqueduct thrown one place 
moon came behind clouds end depression saw wall covered thickly ivy looked silvery moonlight 
ostrianum 
vinicius heart began beat vigor 
gate two quarryrnen took signs 
moment vinicius attendants rather spacious place enclosed sides wall 
separate monuments center entrance hypogeum crypt 
lower part crypt beneath earth graves entrance fountain playing 
evident large number persons could find room hypogeum hence vinicius divined without difficulty ceremony would take place outside space numerous throng soon gathered 
far eye could reach lantern gleamed near lantern many came light whatever 
exception uncovered heads hooded fear treason cold young patrician thought alarm remain thus would able recognize lygia crowd dim light 
near crypt pitch torches ignited put little pile 
light 
crowd began sing certain strange hymn first low voice louder 
vinicius never heard hymn 
yearning struck hymns murmured separate persons way cemetery heard far distinctness power last became penetrating immense together people whole cemetery hills pits region begun yearn 
might seem also certain calling night certain humble prayer rescue wandering darkness 
eyes turned upward seemed see one far high outstretched hands seemed implore descend 
hymn ceased followed moment suspense impressive vinicius companions looked unwittingly toward stars dread something uncommon would happen one would really descend 
vinicius seen multitude temples various structure asia minor egypt rome become acquainted multitude religions varied character heard many hymns first time saw people calling divinity hymns carry fixed ritual calling bottom heart genuine yearning children might feel father mother 
one blind see people merely honored god loved whole soul 
vinicius seen like far land ceremony sanctuary rome greece still rendered honor gods gain aid fear even entered one head love divinities 
though mind occupied lygia attention seeking crowd could avoid seeing uncommon wonderful things happening around 
meanwhile torches thrown fire filled cemetery ruddy light darkened gleam lanterns 
moment old man wearing hooded mantle bare head issued hypogeum 
man mounted stone lay near fire 
crowd swayed 
voices near vinicius whispered peter peter knelt others extended hands toward 
followed silence deep one heard every charred particle dropped torches distant rattle wheels via nomentana sound wind pines grew close cemetery 
chilo bent toward vinicius whispered foremost disciple christ fisherman old man raised hand sign cross blessed present fell knees simultaneously 
vinicius attendants wishing betray followed example others 
young man could seize impressions immediately seemed form saw simple uncommon uncommonness flowed simplicity 
old man mitre head garland oak leaves temples palm hand golden tablet breast wore white robe embroidered stars word bore insignia kind worn priests oriental egyptian greek roman flamens 
vinicius struck difference felt listening christian hymns fisherman seemed like high priest skilled ceremonial witness simple aged immensely venerable journeyed afar relate truth seen touched believed believed existence come love truth precisely believed 
face therefore power convincing truth 
vinicius sceptic wish yield charm old man yielded however certain feverish curiosity know would flow lips companion mysterious christus teaching lygia pomponia gr cina followers 
meanwhile peter began speak spoke beginning like father instructing children teaching live 
enjoined renounce excess luxury love poverty purity life truth endure wrongs persecutions patiently obey government placed guard treason deceit calumny finally give example society even pagans 
vinicius good could bring back lygia evil everything stood barrier touched angered certain counsels 
seemed enjoining purity struggle desires old man dared condemn love rouse lygia confirm opposition 
understood assembly listening words took heart must think enemy teaching outcast 
anger seized thought 
heard new thought 
new religion every one knows every one heard 
cynics enjoined poverty restriction necessities socrates enjoined virtue old thing good one first stoic one meets even one seneca five hundred tables lemon wood praises moderation enjoins truth patience adversity endurance misfortune like stale mouse eaten grain people wish eat smells age 
besides anger feeling disappointment expected discovery unknown magic secrets kind thought least would hear rhetor astonishing eloquence meanwhile heard words immensely simple devoid every ornament 
astonished mute attention crowd listened 
old man spoke people sunk listening told kind poor peaceful pure might peace life might live eternally christ death joy glory health delight one earth attained time 
vinicius though predisposed unfavorably could notice still difference teaching old man cynics stoics philosophers enjoin good virtue reasonable thing practical life promised immortality kind hapless immortality beneath earth wretchedness emptiness want magnificent life equal gods almost 
spoke meanwhile thing perfectly certain hence view faith virtue acquired value simply measureless misfortunes life became incomparably trivial 
suffer temporally inexhaustible happiness thing absolutely different suffering order nature 
old man said virtue truth loved since highest eternal good virtue existing ages god whoso therefore loves loves god becomes cherished child 
vinicius understand well knew previously words spoken pomponia gr cina petronius according belief christians god one almighty therefore heard good thought involuntarily presence demiurge jupiter saturn apollo juno vesta venus would seem like vain noisy rabble interfering account 
greatest astonishment seized old man declared god universal love also hence loves man fulfils god supreme command 
enough love men one nation god man shed blood found among pagans elect cornelius centurion enough either love good us christ forgave jews delivered death roman soldiers nailed cross forgive love injure us return good evil enough love good must love wicked also since love alone possible expel evil 
chilo words thought work gone nothing never world would ursus dare kill glaucus either night night 
comforted another inference teaching old man namely neither would glaucus kill though discover recognize 
vinicius think nothing new words old man amazement asked kind god kind religion kind people heard could find place head simply 
unheard medley ideas 
felt wished example follow teaching would place burning pile thoughts habits character whole nature moment burn ashes fill life altogether different entirely new soul 
science religion commanded roman love parthians syrians greeks egyptians gauls britons forgive enemies return good evil love seemed madness 
time feeling madness something mightier philosophies far 
thought madness impracticable impracticability divine 
soul rejected felt parting field full spikenard kind intoxicating incense man breathed must land lotus eaters forget things else ever yearn 
seemed nothing real religion reality presence paltry deserved time thought 
expanses kind hitherto suspicion surrounded certain immensities certain clouds 
cemetery began produce impression meeting place madmen also place mysterious awful mystic bed something progress birth like world far 
brought mind first moment speech old man said touching life truth love god thoughts dazed brightness eyes blinded lightning flashes follow unceasingly 
usual people life turned one single passion vinicius thought medium love lygia light flashes saw one thing distinctly lygia cemetery confessed religion obeyed felt never could never would mistress 
first time since made acquaintance aulus vinicius felt though found would get 
nothing similar come head far could explain much express understanding dim feeling irreparable loss misfortune 
rose alarm turned soon storm anger christians general old man particular 
fisherman first cast eye considered peasant filled fear almost seemed mysterious power deciding fate inexorably therefore tragically 
quarrymen unobserved added torches fire wind ceased sound pines flame rose evenly slender point toward stars twinkling clear sky 
mentioned death christ old man talked 
held breath breasts silence set deeper preceding one possible almost hear beating hearts 
man seen narrated one whose memory every moment fixed way close eyes would see yet 
told therefore return cross john sat two days nights supper chamber neither sleeping eating suffering sorrow doubt alarm holding heads hands thinking died 
oh grievous grievous third day dawned light whitened walls john sitting chamber without hope comfort 
desire sleep tortured spent night passion without sleep roused began lament 
barely sun risen mary magdala panting hair dishevelled rushed cry taken away lord heard john sprang ran toward sepulchre 
john younger arrived first saw place empty dared enter 
three entrance person speaking enter find stone shirt winding sheet body found 
fear fell thought priests borne away christ returned home greater grief still 
disciples came later raised lament company lord hosts might hear easily separately turn 
spirit died within hoped master would redeem israel third day since death hence understand father deserted son preferred look daylight die grievous burden 
remembrance terrible moments pressed even eyes old man two tears visible light fire coursing gray beard 
hairless aged head shaking voice died breast 
man speaking truth weeping said vinicius soul 
sorrow seized throat simple hearted listeners also 
heard christ sufferings known joy succeeded sorrow since apostle seen told wrung hands impression sobbed beat breasts 
calmed gradually wish hear gained mastery 
old man closed eyes see distant things distinctly soul continued disciples lamented way mary magdala rushed second time crying seen lord 
unable recognize thought gardener said mary cried rabboni fell feet 
commanded go disciples vanished 
disciples believe wept joy upbraided thought sorrow disturbed mind said seen angels grave running thither second time saw grave empty 
later evening appeared cleopas come another emmaus returned quickly saying lord indeed risen discussed closed doors fear jews 
meanwhile stood among though doors made sound feared said peace saw like light like happiness hearts believed risen dead seas dry mountains turn dust glory pass 
eight days thomas didymus put finger lord wounds touched side thomas fell feet cried lord god thou hast seen thou hast believed blessed seen believed said lord

hood fallen head dishevelled hair mouth open slightly eyes raised toward apostle face fixed listening delighted 
dressed dark woollen mantle like daughter people never vinicius seen beautiful notwithstanding disorder risen struck nobility wonderful patrician head distinction dress almost slave 
love flew like flame immense mixed marvellous feeling yearning homage honor desire

standing near gigantic lygian seemed smaller almost child noticed grown slender 
complexion become almost transparent made impression flower spirit 
desire possess woman different women seen possessed rome orient 
felt would given rome world addition

meanwhile christians began pray sing 
maranatha thundered forth great apostle baptized water fountain presbyters presented ready baptism 
seemed vinicius night would never end 
wished follow lygia soon possible seize road house 
last began leave cemetery chilo whispered let us go gate lord removed hoods people look us 
case discourse apostle cast aside hoods hear better followed general example 
chilo advice seemed wise therefore 
standing gate could look passed ursus easy recognize form size 
let us follow said chilo shall see house go 
morrow rather day thou wilt surround entrances slaves take 
said vinicius 
dost thou wish lord follow house take thou wilt undertake task croton replied croton give thee slave break back bison guarding 
chilo fell dissuading entreating gods 
croton taken defense attack case recognized carry girl 
take two expose death worse might let hands would hide another place leave rome 
could act certainty expose destruction whole undertaking failure though vinicius restrained greatest effort seizing lygia arms right cemetery felt greek right would lent ear perhaps counsels croton reward question 
lord command old goat silent said let drop fist head

yes lord said chilo thy maiden powerful protection 
great apostle see passing people kneel 
people fact kneel vinicius look 
lose lygia eyes moment thought bearing away accustomed wars stratagems sorts arranged head whole plan seizure soldierly precision 
felt step decided bold knew well bold attacks give success generally 
way long hence moments thought gulf wonderful religion dug lygia 
understood everything happened past happened 
sufficiently penetrating 
lygia known hitherto 
seen maiden wonderful beyond others maiden toward feelings inflamed knew religion made different women hope feeling desire wealth luxury would attract knew vain illusion 
finally understood petronius understood new religion ingrafted soul something unknown world lived lygia even loved would sacrifice christian truths sake pleasure existed pleasure different altogether petronius c sar court rome pursuing 
every woman knew might become mistress christian would become victim 
thought felt anger burning pain felt anger powerless 
carry lygia seemed possible almost sure could take equally sure view religion bravery nothing power nothing could effect nothing 
roman military tribune convinced power sword fist conquered world would command forever saw first time life beyond power might something else hence asked amazement 
could answer distinctly head flew merely pictures cemetery assembled crowd lygia listening whole soul words old man narrated passion death resurrection god man redeemed world promised happiness shore styx

agreed find lygia 
sought peril life pointed 
want offered carry maiden away could ask anything like maimed man deprived two fingers old man devoted meditation science virtue would happen lord dignity vinicius meet mishap bearing maiden away true gods bound watch chosen ones things happened gods playing games instead watching passing world fortune blindfold well known see even daylight must case night let something happen let lygian bear hurl millstone noble vinicius keg wine still worse water give assurance instead reward blame fall hapless chilo poor sage attached noble vinicius aristotle alexander macedon 
noble lord give least purse thrust girdle leaving home would something invoke aid case need influence christians 
oh listen counsels old man counsels dictated experience prudence vinicius hearing took purse belt threw fingers chilo 
thou hast silent greek felt unusually heavy gained confidence 
whole hope said hercules theseus performed deeds still arduous personal nearest friend croton hercules thee worthy lord call demigod thou art full god future thou wilt forget poor faithful servant whose needs necessary provide time time sunk books thinks nothing else stadia garden land little house even smallest portico coolness summer would befit donor 
meanwhile shall admire thy heroic deeds afar invoke jove befriend thee need make outcry half rome roused thy assistance 
wretched rough road olive oil burned lantern croton noble strong would bear gate arms would learn begin whether carry maiden easily second would act like neas win good gods degree touching result enterprise thoroughly satisfied 
rather carry sheep died mange month ago answered gladiator give purse bestowed worthy tribune bear thee gate 
mayst thou knock great toe thy foot replied greek profit hast thou teachings worthy old man described poverty charity two foremost virtues commanded thee expressly love never shall make thee see even poor christian would easier sun pierce walls mamertine prison truth penetrate thy skull hippopotamus 
never fear said croton strength beast human feeling 
shall christian wish lose bread 
thou knew even rudiments philosophy thou wouldst know gold vanity 
come thy philosophy 
give thee one blow head stomach shall see wins 
ox might said aristotle retorted chilo 
growing gray world 
dawn covered pale light outlines walls 
trees along wayside buildings gravestones scattered began issue shade 
road longer quite empty 
marketmen moving toward gates leading asses mules laden vegetables moved creaking carts game conveyed 
road along sides light mist earth promised good weather 
people distance seemed like apparitions mist 
vinicius stared slender form lygia became silvery light increased 
lord said chilo offend thee foresee end thy bounty thou hast paid may suspected speaking interest 
advise thee go home slaves litter thou hast learned house divine lygia dwells listen elephant trunk croton undertakes carry maiden squeeze thy purse bag curds

vinicius made answer approached gate wonderful sight struck eyes 
two soldiers knelt apostle passing peter placed hand iron helmets moment made sign cross 
never occurred patrician could christians army astonishment thought fire burning city takes houses appearances doctrine embraces new souls every day extends human understandings 
struck also reference lygia convinced wished flee city would guards willing facilitate flight 
thanked gods happened 
passed vacant places beyond wall christians began scatter 
need therefore follow lygia distance carefully rouse attention 
chilo fell complaining wounds pains legs dropped rear 
vinicius oppose judging cowardly incompetent greek would needed 
would even permitted depart wished worthy sage detained circumspection 
curiosity pressed evidently since continued behind moments even approached previous counsels thought old man accompanying apostle might glaucus rather low stature 
walked good reaching trans tiber sun near rising group surrounding lygia dispersed 
apostle old woman boy went river old man lower stature ursus lygia entered narrow vicus advancing still hundred yards went house two shops one sale olives poultry 
chilo walked fifty yards behind vinicius croton halted fixed earth squeezing wall began hiss turn 
needed take counsel 
go chilo said vinicius see house fronts another street 
chilo though complained wounds feet sprang away quickly wings mercury ankles returned moment 
said one entrance 
putting hands together said implore thee lord jupiter apollo vesta cybele isis osiris mithra baal gods orient occident drop plan 
listen stopped sudden saw vinicius face pale emotion eyes glittering like eyes wolf 
enough look understand nothing world would restrain undertaking 
croton began draw air herculean breast sway undeveloped skull side side bears confined cage face least fear evident 
go first said 
thou wilt follow said vinicius commanding tones 
vanished dark entrance 
chilo sprang corner nearest alley watched behind waiting would happen 
chapter xxii inside entrance vinicius comprehend whole difficulty undertaking 
house large several stories one kind thousands built rome view profit rent hence rule built hurriedly badly scarcely year passed numbers fall heads tenants 
real hives high narrow full chambers little dens poor people fixed numerously 
city many streets names houses numbers owners committed collection rent slaves obliged city government give names occupants ignorant frequently 
find one inquiry house often difficult especially gate keeper 
vinicius croton came narrow corridor like passage walled four sides forming kind common atrium whole house fountain middle whose stream fell stone basin fixed ground 
walls internal stairways stone wood leading galleries entrances lodgings 
lodgings ground also provided wooden doors others separated yard woollen screens 
greater part worn rent patched 
hour early living soul yard 
evident asleep house except returned ostrianum 
shall lord asked croton halting 
let us wait one may appear replied vinicius 
seen yard 
moment thought chilo counsel practical 
tens slaves present would easy occupy gate seemed exit search lodgings simultaneously thus come lygia otherwise christians surely lacking house might give notice people seeking 
view risk inquiring strangers 
vinicius stopped think whether would better go slaves 
behind screen hiding remoter lodging came man sieve hand approached fountain 
first glance young tribune recognized ursus 
lygian whispered vinicius 
break bones wait awhile ursus notice two men shadow entrance began quietly sink water vegetables filled sieve 
evident whole night spent cemetery intended prepare meal 
washing finished took wet sieve disappeared behind screen 
croton vinicius followed thinking would come directly lygia lodgings 
astonishment great saw screen divided court lodgings another dark corridor end little garden containing cypresses myrtle bushes small house fixed windowless stone wall another stone building 
understood favoring circumstance 
courtyard tenants might assemble seclusion little house facilitated enterprise 
would set aside defenders rather ursus quickly would reach street quickly captured lygia would help 
likely one would attack attacked would say hostage fleeing c sar 
vinicius would declare guards summon assistance 
ursus almost entering little house sound steps attracted attention halted seeing two persons put sieve balustrade turned 
ye want asked

turning croton said low hurried voice kill croton rushed like tiger one moment lygian able think recognize enemies croton caught arms steel 
vinicius confident man preternatural strength wait end struggle 
passed two sprang door little house pushed open found room trifle dark lighted however fire burning chimney

second person sitting fire old man accompanied young girl ursus road ostrianum 
vinicius rushed suddenly lygia could recognize seized waist raising rushed toward door 
old man barred way true pressing girl one arm breast vinicius pushed aside free 
hood fell head sight face known moment terrible blood grew cold lygia fright voice died throat

equally vain wish grasp door resist 
fingers slipped along stone would fainted terrible picture struck eyes vinicius rushed garden 
ursus holding arms man doubled back completely hanging head mouth filled blood

chapter xxiii piercing pain roused vinicius 
first moment could understand happening 
felt roaring head eyes covered mist 
gradually however consciousness returned last beheld mist three persons bending

ursus road confessed yesterday ready kill confessed intention earlier thee know thee thy love christ explained traitor thou unknown tried persuade murder 
evil spirit took angel said ursus sigh 
time thou wilt tell must think wounded man 
thus speaking began set arm 
though crispus sprinkled water face vinicius fainted repeatedly suffering however fortunate circumstance since feel pain putting arm joint setting 
glaucus fixed limb two strips wood bound quickly firmly keep arm motionless 
operation vinicius recovered consciousness saw lygia 
stood bed holding brass basin water time time glaucus dipped sponge moistened head patient 
vinicius gazed could believe eyes

meanwhile glaucus finished washing wound head applied healing ointment 
ursus took brass basin lygia hands brought cup water wine stood ready table put wounded man lips 
vinicius drank eagerly felt great relief 
operation pain almost passed wound contusion began grow firm perfect consciousness returned 
give another drink said 
lygia took empty cup next room meanwhile crispus words glaucus approached bed saying god permitted thee vinicius accomplish evil deed preserved thee life thou shouldst come thy mind

vinicius grew pale understood wished separate lygia lost might never see life 
knew indeed things great import come virtue wished possess must seek new methods time yet think 
understood whatever might tell people though swear would return lygia pomponia gr cina would believe justified refusing belief 
moreover might done 
instead hunting lygia might gone pomponia sworn renounced pursuit case pomponia would found lygia brought home 
felt promises would restrain solemn oath would received since christian could swear immortal gods believe greatly considered evil spirits 
desired desperately influence lygia guardians way need time 
important see look days even 
every fragment plank oar seems salvation drowning man seemed days might say something bring nearer might think something something favorable might happen 
hence collected thoughts said listen christians

old presbyter accustomed seek things inspiration god beholding exaltation thought perhaps higher power speaking fearing heart bent gray head saying let thou sayest 
vinicius whole time taken eyes ready obedience crispus produced wonderful pervading impression 
seemed among christians lygia kind sibyl priestess surrounded obedience honor yielded also honor 
love felt joined certain awe presence love became something almost insolent

chilo might give notice disappearance prefect city freedmen home event invasion house city guards likely

tyrannical insolent corrupt enough need inexorable tigellinus nero 
military life left certain feeling justice religion conscience understand deed would monstrously mean

question vinicius time one stand lygia 
noticed astonishment moment lygia taken part neither crispus asked assurances felt confident case need superhuman power would defend 
young tribune whose head distinction things possible impossible grown involved faint since discourse apostle ostrianum also far supposing might take place 
considering things soberly remembered said greek asked chilo brought

taking mantle went hurriedly 
find one rome easy even accurate directions cases instinct hunter aided ursus also great knowledge city

seen life moreover night 
besides lofty confident old man persuaded murder glaucus unlike greek bent double terror one could suppose two one person 
chilo noticing ursus looked perfect stranger recovered first fear

least suspicion would take ambush purposely trouble 
thought besides christians killed vinicius evidently dared raise hands noted person 
vinicius protect case need thought course send deliver death 
summoning courage therefore said good man friend noble vinicius sent litter feet swollen walk far

go go put mantle somewhat warmer hood lest slaves quarter might recognize would stop every moment kiss hands 
put new mantle let broad gallic hood lest ursus might recognize features coming clearer light 
wilt thou take asked road 
trans tiber

ursus simple man heard vinicius say greek ostrianum seen croton enter house lygia lived stopped moment said speak untruth old man day thou wert vinicius ostrianum gate

ursus sighed chilo thought could always liked man terrible moment first outburst 
wishing know happened seizing lygia asked voice stern judge ye treat croton speak prevaricate 
ursus sighed second time 
vinicius tell thee

grievous crime murder 
pray thee know even prayer effective unless thou make vow never touch one life finger 
killed purposely answered ursus 
chilo desired secure every case cease condemn murder urge ursus make vow 
inquired also vinicius lygian answered inquiries unwillingly repeating vinicius would hear needed 
speaking way passed last long road separated lodgings greek trans tiber found house 
chilo heart began beat unquietly 
dread seemed ursus beginning look kind greedy expression 
small consolation said kills unwillingly 
prefer every case paralysis strike lygians thou effect zeus thou art able 
thus meditating wrapped closely gallic mantle repeating feared cold 
finally passed entrance first court found corridor leading garden little house halted suddenly said let draw breath shall able speak vinicius give saving advice 
halted though said danger threatened still legs trembled thought among mysterious people seen ostrianum 
meanwhile hymn came ears little house 
inquired chilo 
thou sayest thou art christian knowest among us custom every meal glorify saviour singing answered ursus 
miriam son must returned perhaps apostle visits widow crispus every day 
conduct directly vinicius 
vinicius room large one others small chambers go sleep 
come thou wilt rest 
entered 
rather dark room evening cloudy cold flames candles dispel darkness altogether 
vinicius divined rather recognized chilo hooded man 
chilo seeing bed corner room vinicius moved toward directly looking others conviction would safest near 
oh lord didst thou listen counsels exclaimed putting hands together 
silence said vinicius listen looked sharply chilo eyes spoke slowly emphasis wishing greek understand every word command keep forever memory 
croton threw kill rob dost understand killed people dressed wounds received struggle 
chilo understood moment vinicius spoke way must virtue agreement christians case wished people believe 
saw face hence one moment without showing doubt astonishment raised eyes exclaimed faith breaking ruffian warned thee lord trust teachings bounded head peas thrown wall 
hades torments enough 
honest must rogue difficult rogue become honest fall benefactor lord magnanimous gods remembered represented ursus way christian stopped 
sica brought would slain said vinicius 
bless moment advised thee take knife even 
vinicius turned inquiring glance greek asked hast thou done day told thee lord made vow thy health nothing preparing visit thee good man came said thou hadst sent 
tablet

repeated emphasis gone beneventum dost understand thou gone lord 
morning took leave thee porta capena time thy departure sadness possesses thy magnanimity soften shall cry death like unhappy wife zethos aedon turned nightingale grief itylos 
vinicius though sick accustomed greek suppleness could repress smile 
glad moreover chilo understood flash hence said therefore write thy tears wiped away 
give candle 
chilo pacified perfectly rose advancing steps toward chimney took one candles burning wall 
hood slipped head light fell directly face 
glaucus sprang seat coming quickly stood 
dost thou recognize cephas asked 
voice something terrible shiver ran present 
chilo raised candle dropped earth almost instant bent nearly double began groan mercy glaucus turned toward faithful said man betrayed ruined family history known christians vinicius guessed glaucus reason fainted repeatedly pain dressing wound heard name 
ursus short moment words glaucus like lightning flash darkness 
recognizing chilo side one spring seizing arm bent back exclaiming man persuaded kill glaucus mercy groaned chilo 
give lord exclaimed turning head vinicius save trusted thee take part 
thy letter deliver 
lord lord vinicius looked indifference one passing first affairs greek less known second heart knew pity said bury garden one else take letter 
seemed chilo words final sentence 
bones shaking terrible hands ursus eyes filled tears pain 
god pity cried christian pax vobiscum christian ye believe baptize baptize twice ten times glaucus mistake let speak make slave kill mercy voice stifled pain growing weaker weaker apostle peter rose table moment white head shook drooping toward breast eyes closed opened said amid silence saviour said us thy brother sinned thee chastise repentant forgive 
offended seven times day thee turned thee seven times saying mercy forgive 
came still deeper silence 
glaucus remained long time hands covering face last removed said cephas may god forgive thy offences forgive name christ 
ursus letting go arms greek added may saviour merciful thee forgive thee 
chilo dropped ground supported hands turned head like wild beast caught snare looking around see whence death might come 
trust eyes ears yet dared hope forgiveness 
consciousness returned slowly blue lips still trembling terror 
depart peace said apostle meanwhile 
chilo rose could speak 
approached bed vinicius seeking protection still time yet think man though used services still accomplice condemned acted forgave 
thought come later 
present simply astonishment incredulity evident look 
though seen forgave wished bear away head earliest among incomprehensible people whose kindness terrified almost much cruelty would terrified 
seemed remain longer something unexpected would happen hence standing vinicius said broken voice give letter lord give letter snatching tablet vinicius handed made one obeisance christians another sick man pushed along sidewise wall hurried door 
garden darkness surrounded fear raised hair head felt sure ursus would rush kill night 
would run might legs would move next moment perfectly uncontrollable ursus stood near really 
chilo fell face earth began groan urban christ name urban said fear 
apostle commanded lead thee beyond gate lest thou might go astray darkness strength failed thee conduct thee home 
dost thou say asked chilo raising face 
thou wilt kill seized thee roughly harmed bone thee pardon 
help rise said greek 
thou wilt kill thou wilt take street go farther alone 
ursus raised might feather placed feet conducted dark corridor second court 
passage entrance street 
corridor chilo repeated soul found street recover say go alone 
peace thee 
thee thee let draw breath 
ursus gone breathed full breast 
felt waist hips convince living moved forward hurried step 
kill spite talk euricius christian teaching spite conversation river urban spite heard ostrianum could find answer question 
chapter xxv neither could vinicius discover cause happened bottom soul almost much astonished chilo 
people treat instead avenging attack dress wounds carefully ascribed partly doctrine confessed lygia little also great significance 
conduct chilo simply went beyond understanding man power forgiveness 
question thrust mind kill greek might killed impunity 
ursus would buried garden borne dark tiber period night murders committed c sar even cast human bodies frequently morning one inquired whence came 
thinking christians power right kill chilo 
true pity entirely stranger world young patrician belonged 
athenians raised altar pity opposed long time introduction gladiatorial combats athens 
rome conquered received pardon sometimes instance calicratus king britons taken prisoner time claudius provided bountifully dwelt city freedom 
vengeance personal wrong seemed vinicius proper justified 
neglect entirely opposed spirit 
true heard ostrianum one love even enemies however considered kind theory without application life 
passed head perhaps killed chilo day among festivals period moon proper christians kill man 
heard days among various nations permitted begin war even 
case deliver greek justice apostle say man offended seven times necessary forgive seven times glaucus say chilo may god forgive thee forgive thee chilo done terrible wrong one man could another 
thought would act man killed lygia instance heart vinicius seethed water caldron torments would inflict vengeance glaucus forgiven ursus forgiven ursus might fact kill whomever wished rome perfect impunity needed kill king grove nemi take place 
could gladiator holding office succeeded killing previous king resist man croton could resist one answer questions refrained killing goodness great like world time unbounded love man commands forget one self one wrongs one happiness misfortune live others 
reward people receive vinicius heard ostrianum could understand 
felt however earthly life connected duty renouncing everything good rich benefit others must wretched 
thought christians moment besides greatest astonishment pity shade contempt 
seemed sheep earlier later must eaten wolves roman nature could yield recognition people let devoured 
one thing struck however chilo departure faces bright certain deep joy 
apostle approached glaucus placed hand head said thee christ triumphed 
raised eyes full hope bright joy great unexpected happiness poured 
vinicius could understand joy delight born vengeance looked eyes staring fever somewhat would madman 
saw however saw without internal indignation lygia pressed lips queen hand man appearance slave seemed order world inverted utterly 
next ursus told conducted chilo street asked forgiveness harm might done bones apostle blessed also 
crispus declared day great victory 
hearing victory vinicius lost thread thought altogether 
lygia gave cooling draught held hand moment asked must thou also forgive christians permitted us keep anger heart 
lygia said whoever thy god honor thine 
thou wilt honor thy heart thou lovest 
thine repeated vinicius fainter voice closed eyes weakness mastered 
lygia went returned time bent learn sleeping 
vinicius feeling near opened eyes smiled 
placed hand lightly incline slumber 
great sweetness seized soon felt grievously ill ill reality 
night come violent fever 
could sleep followed lygia eyes wherever went 
times fell kind doze saw heard everything happened around reality mingled feverish dreams 
seemed old deserted cemetery stood temple form tower lygia priestess 
take eyes saw summit tower lute hands light like priestesses night time sing hymns honor moon seen orient 
climbing winding steps great effort bear away 
behind creeping chilo teeth chattering terror repeating lord priestess take vengeance 
vinicius know understood going commit sacrilege felt boundless fear also 
went balustrade surrounding summit tower apostle silvery beard stood lygia side sudden said raise hand belongs 
moved forward path formed rays moon path made heaven 
stretched hands toward begged take company 
woke became conscious looked 
lamp tall staff shone dimly still cast light sufficiently clear 
sitting front fire warming night chilly chamber rather cold 
vinicius saw breath coming steam lips 
midst sat apostle knees low footstool lygia farther glaucus crispus miriam edge one side ursus miriam son nazarius youth handsome face long dark hair reaching shoulders 
lygia listened eyes raised apostle every head turned toward told something undertone 
vinicius gazed peter certain superstitious awe hardly inferior terror felt fever dream 
thought passed mind dream touched truth gray haired man freshly come distant shores would take lygia really take somewhere away unknown paths 
felt sure also old man speaking perhaps telling separate lygia seemed impossible one could speak aught else 
hence collecting presence mind listened peter words 
mistaken altogether apostle speaking christ 
live name thought vinicius 
old man describing seizure christ 
company came servants priest seize 
saviour asked seeking answered jesus nazareth 
said fell ground dared raise hand 
second inquiry seize 
apostle stopped stretched hands toward fire continued night cold like one heart seething drawing sword defend cut ear servant high priest 
would defended life said put thy sword sheath cup father given shall drink seized bound 
spoken thus far peter placed palm forehead silent wishing went stop crowd recollections 
ursus unable restrain sprang feet trimmed light staff till sparks scattered golden rain flame shot vigor 
sat exclaimed matter happened 
stopped suddenly lygia put finger lips 
breathed loudly clear storm soul though ready times kiss feet apostle act one could accept one presence raised hands redeemer night oi splinters would shot soldiers servants priest officials 
tears came eyes thought sorrow mental struggle one hand thought would defended redeemer would called lygians aid splendid fellows acted thus would disobeyed redeemer hindered salvation man 
reason could keep back tears 
peter took palm forehead resumed narrative 
vinicius overpowered new feverish waking dream 
heard mind mixed apostle told night previous ostrianum day christ appeared shore sea tiberius 
saw sheet water broadly spread boat fisherman boat peter lygia 
moving might boat pain broken arm prevented reaching 
wind hurled waves eyes began sink called entreating voice rescue 
lygia knelt apostle turned boat reached oar vinicius seized assistance entered boat fell bottom 
seemed stood saw multitude people sailing 
waves covered heads foam whirl hands could seen peter saved drowning time time gathered boat grew larger miracle 
soon crowds filled numerous collected ostrianum still greater crowds 
vinicius wondered could find place afraid would sink bottom 
lygia pacified showing light distant shore toward sailing 
dream pictures vinicius blended descriptions heard ostrianum lips apostle christ appeared lake 
saw light shore certain form toward peter steering approached weather grew calmer water grew smoother light became greater 
crowd began sing sweet hymns air filled odor nard play water formed rainbow bottom lake lilies roses looking last boat struck breast safely sand 
lygia took hand said come lead thee led light 
vinicius woke dreaming ceased slowly recover sense reality 
seemed time still lake surrounded crowds among knowing reason began look petronius astonished find 
bright light chimney one time brought completely senses 
olive sticks burning slowly rosy ashes splinters pine evidently put moments shot bright flame light vinicius saw lygia sitting far bedside 
sight touched depth soul 
remembered spent night ostrianum busied whole day nursing gone rest one watching 
easy divine must wearied sitting motionless eyes closed 
vinicius knew whether sleeping sunk thought 
looked profile drooping lashes hands lying knees pagan head idea began hatch difficulty side naked beauty confident proud greek roman symmetry another world new immensely pure soul dwelling 
could bring far call christian thinking lygia could separate religion confessed 
understood even others gone rest alone watching injured religion commanded watch 
thought filled wonder religion disagreeable 
would rather lygia acted thus love face eyes statuesque form word reasons snow white grecian roman arms wound around neck 
still felt like women something would lacking 
amazed knew happening saw new feelings kind rising new likings strange world lived hitherto 
opened eyes seeing vinicius gazing approached said thee 
saw thy soul dream replied 
chapter xxvi next morning woke weak cool head free fever 
seemed whispered conversation roused opened eyes lygia 
ursus stooping chimney raking apart gray ashes seeking live coals beneath 
found began blow mouth bellows blacksmith 
vinicius remembering man crushed croton day examined attention befitting lover arena gigantic back resembled back cyclops limbs strong columns 
thanks mercury neck broken thought vinicius 
pollux lygians like one danubian legions heavy work time aloud said hei slave ursus drew head chimney smiling manner almost friendly said god give thee good day lord good health free man slave 
vinicius wished question ursus touching lygia birthplace words produced certain pleasant impression discourse free though common man less disagreeable roman patrician pride slave neither law custom recognized human nature 
thou dost belong aulus asked

art thou sorry killed lord 
christ commanded us kill 
atacinus croton could otherwise muttered ursus 
looked regret hands remained pagan evidently though soul accepted cross 
put pot crane fixed thoughtful eyes fire 
thy fault lord said last 
didst thou raise thy hand king daughter pride boiled first moment vinicius common man barbarian merely dared speak thus familiarly blame addition 
uncommon improbable things met since yesterday added another 
weak without slaves restrained especially since wish learn details lygia life gained upper hand 
calmed therefore inquired war lygians vannius suevi 
ursus glad converse could add much new time aulus plautius told 
ursus battle attended hostages camp atelius hister 
knew lygians beaten suevi yazygi leader king fallen arrows yazygi 
immediately received news semnones set fire forests boundaries returned haste avenge wrong hostages remained atelius ordered first give kingly honors 
afterward lygia mother died 
roman commander knew child 
ursus wished return country road unsafe wild beasts wild tribes 
news came embassy lygians visited pomponius offering aid marcomani hister sent lygia pomponius 
came learned however ambassadors way remained camp whence pomponius took rome conclusion triumph gave king daughter pomponia gr cina 
though certain small details narrative unknown vinicius listened pleasure enormous pride family pleased eye witness confirmed lygia royal descent 
king daughter might occupy position c sar court equal daughters first families since nation whose ruler father warred rome far though barbarian might become terrible according atelius hister possessed immense force warriors 
ursus moreover confirmed completely 
live woods said answer vinicius much land man knows end many people 
also wooden towns forest great plenty semnones marcomani vandals quadi plunder world take 
dare come us wind blows side burn forests

thus speaking put near fire vessel food vinicius silent 
thoughts wandered evidently time yet lygian wildernesses till liquid began boil poured shallow plate cooling properly said glaucus advises thee lord move even thy sound arm little possible callina commanded give thee food 
lygia commanded answer 
even come vinicius head oppose daughter c sar goddess 
uttered word therefore ursus sitting near bed took liquid small cup put mouth 
carefully kindly smile vinicius could believe eyes could think terrible titan day crushed croton rushing like storm would torn pieces lygia pity 
young patrician first time life began ponder take place breast simple man barbarian servant ursus proved nurse awkward painstaking cup lost among herculean fingers completely place left mouth sick man 
fruitless efforts giant troubled greatly said li would easier lead aurochs snare

vinicius whose heart beat quickness sight began upbraid thinking sleep yet answered joyously preparing sleep first take place ursus 
took cup sitting edge bed began give food vinicius felt overcome delighted 
inclined toward warmth body struck unbound hair fell breast 
grew pale impression confusion impulse desires felt also head dear magnified comparison whole world nothing
