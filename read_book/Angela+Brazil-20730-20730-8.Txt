much obliged said jerkily looking nevertheless longing bolt door 
yet make escape 
another time honored ceremony observed 
eyes turned miss bowes rose usual occasion 
think girls said pleasantly considering miss teddington birthday ought take special notice occasion 
suppose ask grant holiday may make expedition honor 
votes forty nine hands instantly raised forty nine voices cried miss teddington utterly disapproved odd holidays term time submitted grace could muster gave rather chilly assent immediately drowned storm clapping 
girls always suspected principals annual argument subject felt scored year rate certainly one holiday good 
question walk

many ingenious devices girls adopted trying find miss teddington christian name age 
spoke historic events happened parents born fondly hoping might betray memory commit 
caught treated events however recent old purely impersonal standpoint left still dark whether infant arms time adult able enjoy newspapers 
subject names indifferent would express opinion relative merits mary martha margaret millicent marion muriel mona maud

whatever decade miss teddington birthday placed year certainly prime life energy concerned school 
keen eyes noticed everything woe betide slacker thought escape dared bring unprepared lesson class 
sarcasms occasions made victims writhe though apt witty enough amuse rest form
