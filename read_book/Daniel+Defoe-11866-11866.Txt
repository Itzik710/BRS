sailed northward upon coast order gain africa till made cape augustine whence going farther ocean sight land steered though bound isle fernand de norenba leaving islands east met terrible tempest continued twelve days successively wind carried us wheresoever pleased 
perplexity one men died one man boy washed overboard 
weather cleared little found eleven degrees north latitude upon coast guinea 
upon captain gave reasons returning opposed counselling stand away barbadoes supposed might attained fifteen days 
altering course sailed north west west order reach leeward islands second storm succeeding drove us westward justly afraid falling hands cruel savages paws devouring beasts prey 
great distress one men early morning cried land land sooner cried ship struck upon sand bank moment sea broke manner expected perished immediately 
knew nothing upon land driven whether island main inhabited inhabited could much hope ship would hold many minutes without breaking pieces except wind miracle turn immediately 
stood looking one another expecting death every moment mate lay hold boat help rest got flung ship side getting eleven us committed god mercy wild sea 
saw last effort would sufficient protection death high sea rise impossible boat live 
making sail none neither could make use 
rowed rather driven league half raging wave like lofty mountain came rolling astern us took us fury overset boat 
thus swallowed moment hardly time call upon tremendous name god much less implore dying ejaculations infinite mercy receive departing souls 
men generally counted insensible struggling pangs death overwhelmed water dreadful apprehensions imaginable 
joys heaven torments hell seemed present dying agonies even small space time life death 
going thought knew whither dismal gulf unknown yet unperceived never behold friends light world could even thought annihilation total dissolution soul well body gloomy thoughts knowledge hoped eternal quietus without life sense even say would enough strike horror confusion strove however last extremity companions overpowered entombed deep great difficulty kept breath till wave spent retiring back left shore half dead water taken 
soon got feet ran fast could lest another wave pursue carry back 
haste made could avoid sea came like high mountain furious enemy business hold breath raising water preserve swimming 
next dreadful wave buried twenty thirty feet deep time carried mighty force swiftness toward shore raising held well possible till length water spent began return struck forward feeling ground feet took heels 
thus served twice length dashed piece rock manner left senseless recovering little return wave doubt would overwhelmed held fast rock till succeeding waves abated fetching another run overtaken small wave soon conquered 
could overtake reached main land clambering cliffs shore tired almost spent sat grass free dangers foaming ocean 
tongue express ecstasies transports soul felt happy deliverance 
like reprieve dying malefactor halter neck ready turned 
wrapt contemplation often lifted hands profoundest humility divine powers saving life rest companions drowned 
began cast eyes around behold place next 
could see house people wet yet clothes shift hungry thirsty yet nothing eat drink weapon destroy creature sustenance defend devouring beasts short nothing knife tobacco pipe box half filled tobacco 
darksome night coming upon increased fears devoured wild creatures mind plunged despair prospect thought life prepared another kind death lately escaped 
walked furlong see could find fresh water great joy taking quid tobacco prevent hunger got thick bushy tree seating could fall deep sleep overtook night buried sorrows quiet repose 
broad day next morning awaked perceived tempest ceased law ship driven almost far rock mentioned waves dashed mile place

found ship bulged great deal water hold stern lifted bank head almost water

divine comfort give remove cause sadness upon occasion 
thus world apprehensions fears three days nights last ventured castle milked goats one almost spoiled want 
next though great fear visited bower milked flocks also growing bolder went shore measuring print foot mine see perhaps whether occasioned mark found much superior largeness returned home absolutely convinced either men ashore island must inhabited therefore might surprised aware 
began think providing security resolved mind many different schemes purpose 
first proposed cut inclosures turn tame cattle wild woods enemy might find frequent island hopes killing 
secondly digging corn fields reason 
lastly concluded demolish bower lest seeing place human contrivance might come farther find attack little castle 
notions fear danger suggest looked thought like unfortunate king saul oppressed philistines also forsaken god 
strange little entirely resigned god little confidence fearing could kill fading body could destroy immortal soul 
sleep utter stranger eyes night yet nature spent tired submitted silent repose next morning joining reason fear considered delightful pleasant island might entirely forsaken might think inhabitants shore might fail either design necessity cross winds latter circumstance 
reason believe would depart first opportunity 
however fear made think place retreat upon attack 
repented made door come beyond fortification remedy resolved make second one fell work therefore drove betwixt double row trees planted twelve years several strong piles thickening pieces timber old cables strengthening foot earth dug cave also made seven holes wherein planted muskets like cannon fitting frames resembling carriages 
finished indefatigable industry great way every planted sticks osier like wood twenty thousand leaving large space wall might room see enemy might sheltered among young trees offered approach outer wall 
indeed scarce two years passed head appeared lovely shady grove six years became thick wood perfectly impassable 
safety left avenue go instead set two ladders one part rock low broke leaving room place another ladder upon took impossible man descend without hurting would still outside outer wall 
took measures human prudence preservation altogether unmindful affairs 
preserve stock tame goats enemy take looked retired part island place lost mentioned finding clear piece land containing three acres surrounded thick woods wrought hard less month time fenced well round flocks well secured put therein two goats ten ones 
labor occasioned purely fearful apprehensions account seeing print man foot 
contented yet done searched another place towards west point island might also retain another flock 
wandering errand west island ever yet done casting eyes towards sea methought perceived boat great distance could possibly tell want perspective glass 
considered strange thing see print man foot concluding cannibals blessed god cast side island none savages thought ever came 
came hill shore sw point island soon confirmed opinion one describe horror amazement saw ground spread sculls hands feet bones human bodies particularly perceived space like circle midst fire conjectured wretches sat unnaturally sacrificed devoured fellow creatures 
horror loathsomeness dreadful spectacle confounded senses made discharge stomach excessive manner 
returned towards habitation way thither shedding floods tears falling bended knees gave god thanks making nature contrary wretches delivering long hands 
though reason long residence assured savages never came thick woody parts country reason apprehensive discovery yet abhorence still retain two years confined three plantation mean castle country seat inclosure woods 
though process time dreadful apprehensions began wear away yet eyes vigilant fear heard creatures proceed attack 
resolved however manfully lose life went armed three pistols stuck girdle added description given made look formidable appearance 
thus circumstances time remained calm undisturbed compared condition others found far miserable 
indeed would persons compare circumstances innumerable unhappy objects beneath sure hear daily murmurings complainings world 
part wanted things 
indeed terror savages put spoiled inventions conveniences 
one projects brew beer whimsical one indeed considered neither casks sufficient could make preserve neither hops make keep yest make work copper kettle make boil 
perhaps indeed years might bring bear done things 
inventions placed another way day night could think nothing might destroy cannibals proceeding bloody entertainments saving victim sacrificed might become servant 
many contrivances purpose many objections occurred hatched 
contrived dig hole place made fire put therein five six pounds gunpowder would consequently blow near loth spend much upon lest certain execution could desire affright kill 
laid design aside proposed lie privately ambush convenient place three guns double loaded let fly midst dreadful ceremony killed two three every shot fall upon rest suddenly three pistols let one mother son escape 
thus imagination pleased fancy much used dream night time 
put design execution long seeking place convenient purpose unseen might behold every action savages 
placed two muskets loaded brace slugs four five smaller bullets size pistol bullets fowling piece charged near handful largest swan shot every pistol four bullets 
thus things prepared sooner would welcome light spread element like giant refreshed wine scripture would issue forth castle lofty hill three miles distant view could see invaders approach unlawfully kingdom 
waited vain two three months grew tiresome brought consideration made examine right kill creatures manner 
argued unnatural custom sin offensive heaven belongs divine alone vindictive power hands shower vengeance upon

god thinks doings according knowledge conceive authority pretend thwart decrees providence permitted actions many ages perhaps almost beginning creation never offended right concern shedding one another blood indeed since known value kill devour captive taken war kill ox eat mutton

considered fell upon much wrong spaniards committed greatest barbarities upon people never offended whole lives kingdom spain eminent race men without common compassion miserable principal sign generous temper considerations made pause made think taken wrong measures resolution argued better never attack remain undiscovered long possibly could opposite conduct would certainly prove destructive scarcely supposed could kill might either overpowered remaining escaping might bring thousands certain destruction 
indeed religion took part much convince contrary duty guilty shedding human blood innocent particular whatever one another nothing leave god power dominion said therein seemed convenient heavenly wisdom 
therefore knees thanked almighty delivering blood guiltiness begged protection might never fall hands 
thus giving attempt rashly begun never ascended hill occasion afterwards removed boat lay side island every thing belonged towards east little cove might least shadow boat near habitation upon island

passing several little incidents relating wind weather shall relate remarkable concerning little kingdom drawing near 
great difficulty finding came went south east side island coming brazils approaching main island chart coast land mark obliged us go shore several islands mouth river oroonoko purpose 
thus perceived thought continent thing long island rather ridge sands 
one islands found spaniards belonged isle trinidad came hither sloop make salt try find pearl muscles

sooner see place calling friday asked looked little clapped hands crying joy yes pointing old abode fell dancing capering mad much ado keep jumping sea swim ashore 
friday said think shall go see father mentioning father name poor affectionate creature fell weeping says see never see poor father long ago die die long ago much old man

english ancient spread three guns fired signal friendship perceived smoke rise creek upon ordered boat taking friday hanging white flag truce went shore accompanied also young friar related history first part life besides sixteen men well armed case met opposition 
rowed directly creek first man fixed eye upon spaniard whose life saved whose face perfectly well knew 
ordered stay boat friday perceiving father distance would jumped sea let boat go 
sooner shore flew like swift arrow bow embrace aged father 
certainly would melt man firmest resolution softest tears see uncommon transports joy saluted first kissed stroked face took arms laid shady tree sat looked earnestly one could picture quarter hour together

frolics ran another channel afternoon set old friday ground would dance round making comical postures gestures would telling one story another travels adventures 
th april anno set foot upon island second time 
faithful spaniard accompanied one approached boat little knew till discovered 
seignor said portuguese know spoke never word giving musket attendant extended arms saying something spanish understand came forward embraced saying inexcusable know deliverer like angel sent heaven saved life beckoned man call companions asking would walk habitation take possession find mean improvements indeed extraordinary ones planted many trees close together place like labyrinth none could find except knew intricate windings 
asked meaning fortifications told would give large account passed since departure till time subdued english thought murderers hoping would displeased since necessity compelled 
knew wicked villains told far finding fault rather heartily glad subdued 
thus talking man sent returned accompanied eleven habits impossible tell nations 
first turned pointing sir said gentlemen owe lives goodness turning pointing made sensible indeed saluted one one ordinary men tho ambassadors noblemen triumphant conqueror behavior agreed manlike majestic gravity time obliging courteous made agreeable last degree 
relate history transactions kingdom spaniard mouth must insert omitted former relation 
matter weighed anchor set sail happened quarrel board ship like occasioned second mutiny till time courageous capitan taking two refractory prisoners laid irons threatening concerned former disorders hanged england running away ship 
frightened rest thinking captain would serve manner though seemed give good word present 
mate intelligence mad acquainted fears make easy safe conspiracies obliged go pass honor word upon good behavior past forgiven testimony ordered two men irons taken forgiven 
brought us anchor night calm two men irons stole musket weapons taking ship pinnace yet hauled ran away brother rogues 
next morning sent long boat men pursue vain mate revenge would demolished little castle burnt furniture destroyed plantations orders put execution 
thus five englishmen island caused great differences faithful spaniard gave perfect account following manner sir remember embassy sent disappointment met absence return 
little variety relation voyage blessed calm weather smooth sea 
great indeed joy countrymen see alive acted principal man board captain shipwrecked vessel dying surprise less knowing taken prisoner savages another nation thought long since entombed monstrous bowels 
showed arms ammunition provisions brought looked upon second joseph advanced pharoah court immediately prepared come along 
indeed obliged trespass upon friendly savages borrowing two canoes pretext fishing came away next morning without provisions except roots served instead bread 
three weeks absence arrived habitation 
met three english sailors confess gave us provisions letter direction left us informed us bring tame goats plant corn cure grapes make pots short every thing necessary life 
particular knew method best taking friday father assist managed affairs rest spaniards wanting kind offices dressing food englishmen nothing ramble divert woods either shooting parrots catching tortoises 
long ashore informed two englishmen unnaturally turned common place residence three others mentioned made spaniards looked upon governor absence endeavor persuade take might one family intreaties vain poor fellows finding nothing done without industry pitched tents north side island little inclining west fear savages 
built two huts one lodge lay stores good natured spaniards giving seeds dug planted done began live prettily 
thus comfortably going three unnatural brutes countrymen mere bullying humor insulted saying governor meaning given possession island mn em build houses upon ground without paying rent 
two honest men let distinguish thought three countrymen jested one invited see fine habitations facetiously told since built tenements great improvements according custom lords give longer lease time desiring fetch scriviner draw writings 
one wretches swearing pay jest snatches fire brand clapping outside hut fairly set fire would soon consumed honest man thrust away trod feet 
hereupon fellow returns pole would ended days poor man avoided blow fetching musket knocked villain began quarrel 
two coming assist fellow obliged honest man take musket also presenting pieces bid villains stand lay arms death decide dispute one way 
brought parley agreed take wounded man begone wrong disarm power make complaint spaniards justice might prevented farther designs 
indeed many trespass afterwards commit treading corn shooting young kids goats plaguing night day resolved come castle challenge three decide right one plain battle spaniards stood see fair play 
one day happened two spaniards one understood english woods met one honest men complained barbarous countrymen destroying corn killing milk goat three kids deprived subsistence grant relief must inevitably starved parted spaniards came home night supper table one began reprehend englishmen mannerly way resenting replied business countrymen place without leave none ground said spaniard calmly inglise must starve replied let starve damn neither plant build damn servants work island would burn huts find island 
rule said spaniard smiling shall servants 
aye god shall replied impudent rascal 
upon starting atkins cries come jack let brush dare build dominions thus leaving us something heated passion away trooped every man gun pistol sword muttering threatening words could imperfectly understand 
night designed murder two companions slept till midnight bower thinking fall upon sleep honest men less thoughtful concerning juncture coming find much fairer way 
soon villains came huts found nobody concluded spaniard given notice therefore swore revenged us 
demolished poor men habitations fire attempted pulled houses limb limb leaving stick stone ground stood broke household stuff pieces tore trees spoiled inclosures short quite ruined every thing 
people met together doubt would bloody battle providence ordered better three got together two castle left us three came back great rage scoffingly telling us done one taking hold spaniard hat twirls round saying seignor jack spaniard shall sauce mind manners 
spaniard grave courageous man knocked one blow fist another villain fired pistol narrowly missed body wounded little ear 
hereat enraged spaniard takes fellow musket knocked would shot rest come taken arms every one 
englishmen perceiving made us enemies began cool withstanding better words spaniards would return arms telling would manner harm would live peaceably offered injury plantation castle would shoot would ravenous beasts 
made mad went away raging like furies hell 
sooner gone came two honest men fired justest rage ruined aforesaid 
indeed hard nineteen us bullied three villains continually offending impunity 
great sir could persuade two englishmen pursuing undoubtedly killing fire arms promised justice done mean time reside us habitation 
five days three vagrants almost starved hunger drew near grove perceiving governor two others walking side creek submissively desired received family 
told great incivility us unnatural barbarity countrymen yet would see rest agreed half hour time would bring word 
debate called two countrymen laid heavy charge ruining designing murder could deny 
forced interpose mediator obliging two englishmen hurt naked unarmed three make restitution building two huts fencing ground manner 
well miserable condition submitted present lived time regularly enough except working part care spaniards would dispensed continued easy quiet 
arms given scarce week became troublesome ever accident happening soon obliged us lay aside private resentments look common preservation 
one night sir went bed perfectly well health yet means could compose sleep upon uneasy got looked dark could perceive nothing trees around castle 
went bed one could sleep one spaniards hearing walk asked answered 
told occasion sir said things slighted certainly mischief plotting us 
englishmen said answered huts lay separate us sir since last mutiny 
well said kind spirit gives information advantage 
come let us go abroad see thing offers justify fears 
upon spaniards went mountain ladder grove struck panic fear seeing light though fire little distance hearing voices several men 
hereupon retreated immediately raised rest forces made sensible impending danger authority could make stay earnest see things went 
indeed darkness night gave opportunity enough view light fire undiscovered 
different parties straggling shore much afraid find habitations destroy flocks goats prevent sent immediately englishman two spaniards drive goats valley cave lay occasion cave resuming native courage prudent conduct divided durst venture attack hundred light resolved send friday father spy immediately stripping naked gets among undiscovered two hours time brings word two parties two different nations lately bloody battle one another happened land mere chance island devour miserable prisoners entirely ignorant person inhabiting rather filled rage fury one another believed soon day light appeared would terrible engagement 
old friday scarce ended relation heard uncommon noise perceived horrid engagement two armies 
curiosity party especially englishmen would lie close tho old friday told safety depended upon patience behold savages kill one another 
however used caution going farther woods placing convenient place behold battle 
never could bloody engagement men invincible spirits prudent conduct according manner way fighting 
lasted near two hours till party nearest castle began decline last fly conquerors 
undoubtedly put great consternation account lest run grove consequently bring us like danger 
hereupon resolved kill first came prevent discovery swords butt end muskets fear report guns heard 
indeed thought happened three vanquished army crossing creek ran directly place thick wood shelter long scout gave us notice also victors think fit pursue 
upon would suffer slain surprised taken party afterwards proved good servants us stout young creatures able great deal work 
remainder conquered savages fled canoes put ocean conquerors joining together shouted way triumph three afternoon also embarked nation 
thus freed savages fears perceiving creatures considerable time 
found two thirty men dead field battle slain long arrows found sticking bodies rest killed great unwieldy wooden swords denoted vast strength found seventeen besides bows arrows could find one wounded creature among alive either kill enemies quite carry wounded away 
terrible fight tamed englishmen time considering unfortunate might fallen hands would kill enemies also food cattle indeed much nauseate stomachs made sick tractable common necessary business whole society planting sowing reaping greatest signs amity friendship good friends began consider circumstances general first thing thought whether perceived savages haunted side island retired parts yet well suited manner living equally advantage ought rather move place residence plant much safer place security corn cattle 
long debate head resolved rather voted nemine comradicente remove ancient castle good reason time expected hear supreme governor meaning sir whose messengers finding us might think place demolished subjects destroyed savages 
next concern relating corn cattle consented removed valley cave proper sufficient 
yet considered farther altered one part resolution remove part cattle thither plant part corn case one part destroyed might preserved 
another resolution took really great deal prudence trusting three savages taken prisoners knowledge plantations made valley number cattle much less cave wherein kept several arms two barrels powder left us departure island 
though could change habitation resolved make fortified secret 
end sir planted trees distance entrance palace imitating example planted filled whole space ground even banks creek nay ooze tide flowed leaving place landing among planted intermingled many short ones growing wonderfully fast thick little dog could scarcely find passage 
sufficient thought ground right left hand us even top hill without much leaving passage except ladder taken nothing wings witchcraft could pretend come near us 
indeed exceedingly well contrived especially serve occasion afterwards found necessary 
thus lived two years happy retirement time one visit savages 
indeed one morning alarm put us amazement spaniards early perceived less twenty canoes coming shore upon returning home great precipitation gave us alarm obliged us keep home day next going night time make observations good luck would upon another design land time upon island 
happened another quarrel three wicked englishmen spaniards 
occasion one enraged one savages taken prisoner able comprehend something showing snatched hatchet great fury correct kill yet missing head gave barbarous cut shoulder like struck arm one good natured spaniards interposing englishman savage beseeched former murder poor creature kindness like cost spaniard life englishman struck manner nimbly wisely avoiding returned suddenly upon shovel work corn land fairly knocked brutish creature 
hereupon another englishman coming fellow assistance laid good spaniard earth immediately two others coming relief attacked third englishman armed old cutlass wounded 
uproar soon reached ears rushing upon took three englishmen prisoners next question would done mutinous impudent fellows furious desperate idle mischievious highest degree consequently safe society let live among 
sir governor absence also took authority judge brought told country would hanged every mother son since englishman meaning kind sir indebted preservation deliverance would gratitude use possible mildness time leave judgment two englishmen hoped forgetting resentments would deal impartially 
hereupon one countrymen stood sir said leave us may sensible reason sentence gallows besides sir fellow atkins two others proposed us might murder sleep could consent knowing inability vigilance think fit discover 
signor said hear alledged say justify horrid action murder us cold blood far sir wretch denying swore damn would still 
done seignor atkins said gain killing us shall prevent must kill kill us seignor atkins said smiling put us unhappy dilemma fatal necessity great rage scoffing yet severe jest put going fly undoubtedly attempted kill possessed weapons prevented three spaniards 
unparalleled villainous carriage made us seriously consider done 
two englishmen spaniard saved poor indian life mightily petitioned hang one example others twice attempted commit murder hatchet time thought impossible poor slave recover 
could never gain consent put death reasons mentioned since englishman even deliverer merciful counsels prevailing earnestly pressed got opinion clemency 
prevent us farther mischief agreed weapons sword gun powder shot expelled society live pleased neither two englishmen rest spaniards conversation upon account whatsoever kept coming within certain distance castle dared offer us violence either spoiling burning killing destroying corn plantings buildings fences cattle belonging society would shoot freely would beasts prey whatsoever places find 
sentence seemed like merciful judge called two honest englishmen saying must consider ought starved neither since time raise corn cattle let us give corn last eight months seed sow time raise let us also bestow upon six milch goats four ones six kids well present support increase tools necessary work hatchets ax saw things convenient build huts agreed took possession obliged solemnly swear never attempt thing us countrymen future 
thus dismissing society went away sullen refractory though neither willing go stay however seeing remedy took provision given proposing choose convenient place might live 
five days came limits appointed order victuals sent word one spaniards called pitched tents marked habitation plantation ne remote part island 
indeed built two handsome cottages resembling little castle side mountain trees already growing three sides planting would obscured sight unless particularly sought 
huts finished gave dry goat skins bedding covering upon giving us fuller assurances good behavior future gave pease barley rice sowing whatever tools could spare 
six months live separate condition got first harvest quantity small planted little land indeed plantations form made difficult especially thing element obliged make boards pots c could make little nothing 
rainy season coming put greater perplexity want cave keep corn dry prevent spoiling much humble begged spaniards help good natured men readily consented four days space worked great hole side hill large enough purpose secure corn things rain though comparable several additional appartments 
new whim possessed rogues three quarters year like ruined us seems tired weary sort living made work without hopes changing condition nothing would serve would make voyage continent try could seize upon savages bring slaves drudgery lived ease pleasure 
indeed project preposterous gone farther neither proposed thing mischief design event 
one morning three fellows came limited station humbly desired admitted talk us readily granted told us short tired manner living labor hands employments sufficient procure necessaries life desired one canoes came arms ammunition defense would seek fortunes abroad never trouble us 
sure glad enough get rid wretched plagues yet honesty made us ingenuously represent suffered certain destruction running either starved death murdered savages 
audaciously replied neither could would work consequently might well starved abroad home neither wives children cry nay intent upon voyage spaniards given arms canoe would gone without 
though could well spare fire arms rather go like naked men let two muskets pistol cutlass three hatchets thought sufficient gave also goat flesh great basket full dried grapes pot fresh butter young live kid large canoe sufficient carry twenty men 
thus mast made long pole sail six large goat skins dried fair breeze flood tide merrily sailed away spaniards calling bon voyaje man ever expecting see 
gone spaniards englishmen would often say one another peaceably live since turbulent fellows left us nothing could farther thoughts behold faces yet scarce two twenty days passed heads one englishmen abroad planting perceived distance three men well armed approaching towards 
away flies speed castle tells rest undone strangers landed upon island could tell added savages men habited bearing arms 
said less occasion concerned since indians must friends sure christian people upon earth us good rather harm 
considering event came three englishmen whose voices quickly knew admiration nature ceased 
wonder succeeded another sort inquiry could occasion returning quickly island little expected much less desired company better related ordered brought gave following relation voyage 
two days sail something less reached land found people coming give another sort reception expected desired savages armed bows arrows durst venture shore steered northward six seven hours till gained opening plainly perceived land appeared place main land island 
entrance opening sea discovered another island right hand northward several lying westward resolved go shore put one western islands 
found natives courteous giving several roots dried fish nay even women willing supply could procure eat bringing great way upon heads 
among hospitable indians continued days inquiring signs tokens nations lay around informed several fierce terrible people lived every way accustomed eat mankind never used diet except taken battle made solemn feast 
englishmen inquired long since feast kind answered two moons ago pointing moon two fingers time king two hundred prisoners fattening slaughter 
englishmen mighty desirous seeing prisoners others mistaking thought wanted food upon beckoned pointing rising setting sun meaning time appeared east next morning would bring indeed good word time brought eleven men five women many cows oxen brought sea port towns victual ship 
brutish englishmen stomachs turned sight 
case could tell refuse prisoner would highest affront offered savage gentry dispose knew manner however resolved accept gave return one hatchets old key knife six seven bullets things tho wholly ignorant yet seemed entirely contented dragging poor wretches boat hands bound behind delivered englishmen 
obliged put soon presents lest donors expected two three killed invited dinner next day taking leave possible respect thanks though neither understood others said sailed away back first island set eight prisoners liberty 
voyage endeavored comfort conversation poor captives impossible make sensible thing nothing could say give could make otherwise persuaded unbound devoured gave food thought fatten slaughter looked one particularly poor creature supposed first sacrifice even brought island began use greatest humanity kindness yet expected every day new masters would devour 
thus sir three strange wanderers conclude unaccountable relation voyage amazing entertaining 
hereupon asked new family told put one huts came beg victuals 
indeed made us long see taking friday father us leaving two castle came behold poor creatures 
arrived hut bound englishmen fear escaping found stark naked expecting fatal tragedy three lusty men well shaped straight good limbs thirty five thirty years old five women two might thirty forty two four twenty last comely tall maiden seventeen 
indeed women agreeable proportion features except tawny modest behavior graces made amends afterwards came clothed 
naked appearance together miserable circumstances comfortable sight spaniards parts may venture sir without flattery say men best behavior calmest tempers sweetest nature possibly immediately ordered friday father see knew understood could say 
sooner old indian appear looked great seriousness yet nation utter strangers none could understand speech signs one woman 
enough answer design assure would killed fallen hands christians abhorred barbarity 
fully satisfied expressed joy strange gestures uncommon tones possible describe 
woman interpreter ordered next enquire whether content servants would work men brought hither save lives hereupon time unbound fell capering dancing one taking thing upon shoulders intimating willing thing 
sir women among us dreading might occasion strife blood asked three men would intended use creatures whether servants women one pertly readily answered would use gentlemen said masters going restrain methinks avoiding dissentions among would desire engage none take one woman wife taken one none else presume touch though yet priestly authority marry yet reasonable whoever thus takes woman obliged maintain since nobody thing indeed appeared present unanimously agreed 
englishmen asked spaniards whether designed take answered declaring already wives spain others cared join infidels 
reverse englishmen took temporary wife set new method living 
friday father spaniards three savage servants taken late battle lived ancient castle indeed supplied main part island food necessity required 
remarkable part story englishmen much variance agree choice women yet took way good enough prevent quarreling among 
let five women one huts going drew lots first choice 
first lot went hut fetched chose remarkable took homely eldest number made rest englishmen exceedingly merry spaniards could help smile happened fellow best thought choosing one fit application business indeed proved best wife parcel 
poor creatures perceived placed row separated one one seized unspeakable terror thinking going slain earnest englishmen came take first rest set lamentable cry clasped arms around neck hanging took last farewell thought trembling agonies affectionate embraces would softened hardest heart world made driest eyes melt tears could persuaded going die till time friday father made sensible englishmen chosen wives ended terror concern upon occasion 
well englishmen went work assisted good natured spaniards hours erected every one new hut tent separate lodging since already filled tools household stuff provision 
continued north shore island separate three wicked ones pitching farther two honest men nearer castle island seemed peopled three places three towns beginning built purpose 
remark common two honest men worst wives mean industry cleanliness ingenuity three reprobates enjoyed women quite contrary qualities 
another observation made favor two honest men show disparity diligent application business one hand slothful negligent idle temper 
parcel ground laid corn sow sufficient either cultivation planting 
two honest men multitude young trees planted habitations approached near nothing appeared wood pleasing delightful 
every thing prospered flourished grapes planted order seemed though managed vineyard infinitely preferable others 
wanting find place retreat dug cave retired part thick wood secure wives children provision chiefest goods surrounded innumerable stakes subtle entrance case mischief happen either fellow countrymen devouring savages 
reprobates though must much civilized instead delightful wood surrounding dwellings found words king solomon truly verified went vineyard slothful overgrown thorns 
many places crop obliterated weeds hedges several gaps wild goats got eaten corn dead bush stop gaps present shutting stable door steed stolen away 
wives observed diligent cleanly enough especially victuals instructed one honest men cook mate board ship well cooked companion families lived well idle husbands nothing loiter fetch turtle eggs catch fish birds thing work lived accordingly diligent lived handsomely plentifully comfortable manner 
sir come lay eyes scene quite different thing ever happened us perhaps ever befel time residence island 
shall inform original following manner 
one morning sir early came five six canoes indians shore indisputably upon old custom devouring prisoners 
upon occasion lie concealed notice inhabitants might depart quietly performing bloody execution whoever first discovered savages give notice three plantations keep within doors proper scout placed give intelligence departure 
notwithstanding wise measures unhappy disaster discovered us savages like caused desolation whole island savages gone canoes spaniards looking abroad inflamed curiosity see great amazement beheld three savages fast asleep ground either gorged could awake others went wandered far woods come back time 
first could tell slaves enough already killing neither christianity humanity would suffer us shed blood persons never us wrong 
perceived boat left transport nation letting wander might discover us inform first savages happen land upon bloody occasion information might entirely ruin us therefore counselled spaniards secure set work till could better dispose 
hereupon went back making awake took prisoners 
impossible express horror especially bound thinking going murdered eaten soon eased fear point 
first took bower chief country work lay keeping goats planting corn c carried two englishmen habitation help business happy us carry castle sequel appear 
englishmen indeed found work whether guard strictly thought could better tell certainly one ran away woods could hear long time 
undoubtedly reason enough suppose got home canoes savages returning four weeks time going space two days 
may certain sir thought could terrify us exceedingly make us justly conclude savage would inform countrymen abode island weak comparison numbers expected would long englishmen would attacked habitations savages seen places safety woods castle great happiness know 
mistaken thoughts upon occasion eight months six canoes ten men canoe came sailing north side island never accustomed landed hour sunrise near mile dwelling two englishman seems good fortune discover league hour could come 
confirmed opinion certainly betrayed immediately bound two slaves left causing two three men brought women proved faithful lead wives conveniences retired care wood bind two fellows hand foot till orders 
opened fences kept milch goats drove giving goats liberty ramble woods make savages believe wild ones slave given truer information made come inclosures 
two frighted men sent slave three accident alarm spaniards desire assistance mean time took arms ammunition made cave sent wives securing slaves seated private place whence might behold actions savages 
gone far ascending rising ground could see little army indians approach beautiful dwelling moments perceive furniture unspeakable grief burning consuming flame war done spread searching every bush place people evident information 
upon two englishmen thinking secure stood retreated half mile higher country rightly concluding farther savages strolled would less numbers together upon next took stand trunk old tree hollow large whence resolved see would offer stood long two savages came running directly towards though knowledge seemed resolved attack little farther three five behind running way 
imagined perplexity poor men sight thinking assistance speedily come cave wood would discovered consequently therein lost resolved resist overpowered ascend top trees might defend long ammunition lasted sell lives dear possible devouring savages 
thus fixed resolution next considered whether fire first two wait three take middle party two first five last would separated 
regulation two savages also confirmed turning little another part wood three five came directly towards tree 
hereupon resolved take direct line approached nearer perhaps first shot might hit three upon occasion man fire charged piece three four bullets 
thus waiting savages came one runaway caused mischief resolved escape fired 
however though fire together ready charged first let fly good marksman miss aim killed foremost outright second runaway indian fell ground shot body dead third little wounded shoulder sitting ground fell screaming fearful manner 
noise guns made resounding echoes one side raised birds sorts fluttering confused noise much terrified five savages behind stood still first like many inanimate images 
things profound silence came place companions lay sensible liable fate stood wounded man undoubtedly inquiring occasion sad calamity tis reasonable suppose told came thunder lightning gods never seen heard gun whole course lives 
time englishmen loaded pieces fired together second time seeing fall immediately ground thought killed every creature 
made come boldly charged guns indeed wrong step came place found four alive two little wounded one obliged fall upon muskets first knocked runaway savage head another little wounded arm put languishing wretches pain hurt bended knees uplifted hands made piteous moans signs spare life indeed unmerciful poor wretch pointed sit root tree hard one englishmen piece rope twine pocket mere chance tying two feet fast together two hands behind left making haste could two fearing find cave though could overtake satisfaction perceive distance cross valley towards sea quite contrary way retreat upon returned tree look prisoner came gone leaving piece rope yarn wherewith bound behind 
well much concerned ever knowing near enemies might numbers 
immediately repaired cave see well found every thing safe except women frightened upon husbands account loved entirely 
long seven spaniards came assist ten servants friday father gone defend bower corn cattle case savages rambled far 
accompanied seven spaniards one three savages formerly taken prisoner also indian englishmen little left tree seems passed way slaughter made carried along poor wretch left bound 
many prisoners becoming burthen us fearing dreadful consequence escaping spaniards english urged absolute necessity killing common preservation sir authority bore governor ruled piece cruelty ordered sent prisoners old cave valley bound hands feet two spaniards guard 
much encouraged englishmen approach spaniards great fury savages destroying habitations patience stay longer taking five spaniards along armed four muskets pistol quarter staff away went pursuit enemies 
passed place savages slain easy perceived attempted carry dead bodies found impracticable 
rising ground party mortification see smoke proceeded ruins coming farther flight shore plainly perceived savages embarked canoes putting sea 
sorry coming give parting salute however glad enough get clear unwelcome guests 
thus two honest unfortunate englishmen ruined second time improvements quite destroyed good natured spaniards helped rebuild assisted needful supplies nay remarkable three mischievous countrymen heard disasters living remote eastward friendly sympathised worked several days little habitations rebuilt necessities supplied restored former tranquility 
though savages nothing boast adventure several canoes driven ashore followed two drowned creatures undoubtedly met storm sea night departed yet natural supposed whose better fortune attain native shore would inflame nation another ruinous attempt greater force carry 
indeed happened seven months island invaded formidable navy less eight twenty canoes full savages armed wooden swords monstrous clubs bows arrows like instruments war landing east end island 
may well sir imagine consternation men upon account speedy execute resolution night time allowed 
knew since could withstand enemies concealment way procure safety therefore took huts built two englishmen drove flocks goats together bower old cave valley leaving little appearance inhabitants possible posted force plantation two men 
expected happened early next morning indians leaving canoes east end island came running along shore two hundred fifty number near could guessed 
army little indeed greatest misfortune arms sufficient 
account men sir follows viz 
spaniards englishmen old friday three savages taken five women proved faithful servants three slaves living spaniards 
arm muskets pistols fowling pieces swords old halberts muskets fowling pieces taken sailors reduced 
slaves gave three halberts three long staves great iron spikes end hatchets sides also hatchets sticking girdles besides fire arms nay two women inspired amazonian fortitude could dissuaded fighting along dear husbands died die seeing resolution gave hatchets likewise pleased best bows arrows dexterously knew use indians left behind memorable battle one another 
army though little great intrepidity constituted chief general commander knowing atkins though exceedingly wicked yet man invincible courage gave power commanding six men muskets loaded six seven bullets piece planted behind small thicket bushes advanced guard orders let first pass fired middle making nimble retreat round part wood come rear spaniards shaded thicket trees though savages came fierceness lions yet wanted subtility foxes manner order straggling heaps every way indeed atkins fifty savages passed ordered three men give fire great consternation see many men killed wounded hear dreadful noise yet knew whence came frightened highest degree second volley given concluded less companions slain thunder lightning heaven 
notion would continued atkins men retired soon fired according order rest near pour shot continually might complete victory obtained staying load pieces discovered whole matter 
perceived scattering savages distance let fly arrows among wounded atkins killed fellow englishman one indians taken women 
party fail answer retreat killed twenty savages 
take notice poor dying slave tho stopt retreat fatal arrow yet staff hatchet desperately gallantly assailed pursuers killed five savages life submitted multiplicity wounds 
cruelty malice indians less remarked breaking arms legs heads two dead bodies clubs wooden swords wretched manner 
atkins retreated party advanced interpose savages three vollies obliged retreat also numerous desperate came teeth shot arrows like cloud wounded men enraged cruel pain fought like madmen 
however think fit follow us drawing circle gave two triumphant shouts token victory though grief see several wounded men bleed death 
sir drawn little army together upon rising ground atkins wounded would us attack whole body savages extremely well pleased gallantry man upon consideration replied perceive seignor atkins wounded men fight let alone till morning faint stiff sore shall fewer combat 
atkins smiling replied true seignor shall reason would fight warm 
answered seignor atkins part behaved gallantly able approach enemy morning fight till think convenient wait tarried 
brightness moon night perceived savages great disorder dead wounded men 
made us change resolution resolve fall upon night could give one volley undiscovered 
fair opportunity one two englishmen leading us round woods sea side westward turning short south came privately place thickest 
unheard unperceived eight us fired among dreadful execution half minute eight us let fly killing wounding abundance dividing three bodies eight persons body marched among trees teeth enemy sending forth greatest shouts acclamations 
savages hearing different noise three quarters stood utmost confusion coming sight us let fly volley arrows wounded poor old friday yet happily prove mortal 
however give second opportunity rushing among fired three several ways fell work swords staves hatchets butt end muskets fury resisted dismal screaming howling recourse feet save lives speedy flight 
must forget valor two women exposed greatest dangers killed many arrows valiantly destroyed several hatchets 
fighting two battles much tired trouble pursue canoes thought would presently put ocean happening dreadful storm sea continuing night prevented voyage dashed several boats pieces beach drove rest high upon shore required infinite labor get 
men taken refreshment little repose resolved early morning go towards place landing see whether gone posture remained 
necessarily led place battle several savages expiring sight way pleasing generous minds delight misery though obliged conquer law arms indian slaves put pain dispatching hatchets 
length coming view remainder army found leaning upon knees bended towards mouth head two hands 
hereupon coming within musket shot ordered two pieces fired without ball order alarm might plainly know whether courage venture another battle utterly dispirited attempt might accordingly manage 
indeed prospect took well sooner savages hear first gun perceive flash second suddenly started upon feet greatest consternation approached towards ran howling screaming away hill country 
could rather first wished weather permitted gone sea considered escape might occasion approach multitudes utter ruin dissolution well pleased contrary happened atkins tho wounded would part us advised us let slip advantage clapping boats deprive capacity ever returning plague island know said objection make creatures living like beasts wood may make excursions rifle plantations destroy tame goats consider better hundred men kill make slaves leisure hundred nations impossible save much less subdue 
advice arguments approved set fire boats though wet could burn entirely yet made incapable swimming seas 
soon indians perceived many ran woods fight us kneeling piteously cried oa oa waramakoa 
intimating suppose would spare canoes would never trouble us 
complaints submissions entreaties vain self preservation obliging us contrary destroyed every one escaped fury ocean 
indians perceived raised lamentable cry ran woods continued ranging making woods ring lamentation 
considered making creatures thus desperate ought time set sufficient guard upon plantations savages ranging found bower destroyed fences trod corn feet tore vines grapes 
true always able fight creatures swift us numerous durst go single fear though needless weapons materials make indeed extremity appeared little time

first house mentioned boatswain slain two pole ax threw hand granade house bursting made terrible havoc killing wounding king train house fell victims fury every creature either smothered burnt 
never fired gun lest people awaken faster could overpower 
fire awakened fast enough obliged fellows keep together bodies 
time whole town flame yet fury rather increased calling one another remember tom jeffery 
terrible light conflagration made uneasy roused nephew captain rest men knew nothing matter 
perceived dreadful smoke heard guns go readily concluded men danger therefore takes another boat comes ashore thirteen men well armed 
greatly surprised see two men boat told story though argued men danger voyage interests merchants owners safety ship yet nephew like rest declared would rather lose ship voyage life men lost want help away went 
part seeing resolved go power stay behind 
ordered pinnace back twelve men marched directly flame guided us 
surely never scene horror beheld dismal cries heard except oliver cromwell took drogheda ireland neither spared man woman child 
first object think met ruins one habitations lay four men three woman killed two burnt death among fire decaying 
nothing could appear barbarous revenge none cruel authors

gone much farther beheld three naked women followed sixteen seventeen men flying greatest swiftness men shot one sight 
perceived us supposed also murderers set dreadful shriek swooned away fright 
sight might softened hardest heart pity took ways let know would hurt poor creatures bended knees lifted hands made piteous lamentations us save lives 
ordered men hunt poor creatures whatsoever willing understand occasion went among unhappy wretches neither understood good meant
