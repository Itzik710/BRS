q whence word non resistance derived command resist evil 
v 
q word express expresses lofty christian virtue enjoined us christ 
q ought word non resistance taken widest sense say intending offer resistance kind evil ought taken exact sense saviour teaching repaying evil evil 
ought oppose evil every righteous means power evil 
q show christ enjoined non resistance sense shown words uttered time 
said ye heard said old eye eye tooth tooth 
say unto resist evil 
one smites thee right cheek turn also one go law thee take thy coat thee give thy cloak also 
q speaking words ye heard said old patriarchs prophets contained old testament hebrews ordinarily call law prophets 
q utterances christ refer words said old utterances noah moses prophets admit right bodily harm inflict harm punish prevent evil deeds 
q quote utterances 
whoso sheddeth man blood man shall blood shed 
gen ix 

smiteth man die shall surely put death mischief follow thou shalt give life life eye eye tooth tooth hand hand foot foot burning burning wound wound stripe stripe

killeth man shall surely put death

judges shall make diligent inquisition behold witness false witness hath testified falsely brother shall ye unto thought done unto brother thine eye shall pity life shall go life eye eye tooth tooth hand hand foot foot 
deut 
xix 

noah moses prophets taught kills maims injures neighbors evil 
resist evil prevent evil doer must punished death maiming physical injury 
wrong must opposed wrong murder murder injury injury evil evil 
thus taught noah moses prophets 
christ rejects 
say unto written gospel resist evil oppose injury injury rather bear repeated injury evil doer 
permitted forbidden 
understand kind resistance taught know exactly resistance christ forbade 
q ancients allowed resistance injury injury yes 
jesus forbids 
christian case right put death neighbor done evil injury return 
q may kill maim self defense 
q may go complaint judge wronged may punished 
others reality 
q fight conflict foreign enemies disturbers peace certainly 
take part war preparations war 
make use deadly weapon 
oppose injury injury whether alone others either person people 
q voluntarily vote furnish soldiers government nothing kind wishes faithful christ law 
q voluntarily give money aid government resting military force capital punishment violence general unless money destined special object right good aim means 
q pay taxes government ought voluntarily pay taxes ought resist collecting taxes 
tax levied government exacted independently subject 
impossible resist without recourse violence kind 
since christian employ violence obliged offer property loss violence inflicted authorities 
q christian give vote elections take part government law business participation election government law business participation government force 
q wherein lies chief significance doctrine non resistance fact alone allows possibility eradicating evil one heart also one neighbor doctrine forbids whereby evil endured ages multiplied world 
attacks another injures kindles feeling hatred root every evil 
injure another injured us even aim overcoming evil doubling harm oneself begetting least setting free inciting evil spirit wish drive 
satan never driven satan 
error never corrected error evil vanquished evil 
true non resistance real resistance evil 
crushing serpent head 
destroys end extirpates evil feeling 
q true meaning rule non resistance always put practice put practice like every virtue enjoined law god 
virtue practiced circumstances without self sacrifice privation suffering extreme cases loss life 
esteems life fulfilling god already dead true life 
trying save life loses 
besides generally speaking non resistance costs sacrifice single life material welfare resistance costs thousand sacrifices 
non resistance salvation resistance ruin 
incomparably less dangerous act justly unjustly submit injuries resist violence less dangerous even one relations present life 
men refused resist evil evil world would happy 
q long act thus happen one man acted thus rest agreed crucify would nobler die glory non resisting love praying enemies live wear crown caesar stained blood slain however one man thousand men firmly resolved oppose evil evil far free danger violence resort violence whether among civilized savage neighbors 
robber murderer cheat leave peace sooner oppose arms take sword shall perish sword seek peace behave kindly harmlessly forgiving forgetting injuries part enjoy peace die die blessed 
way kept ordinance non resistance would obviously evil crime 
majority acted thus would establish rule love good even evil doers never opposing evil evil never resorting force 
moderately large minority men would exercise salutary moral influence society every cruel punishment would abolished violence feud would replaced peace love 
even small minority would rarely experience anything worse world contempt meantime world though unconscious grateful would continually becoming wiser better unseen action 
worst case members minority persecuted death dying truth would left behind doctrine sanctified blood martyrdom 
peace seek peace may overruling love imperishable heritage every soul obeys willingly christ word resist evil 
adin ballou 
fifty years ballou wrote published books dealing principally question non resistance evil force 
works distinguished clearness thought eloquence exposition question looked every possible side binding nature command every christian acknowledges bible revelation god firmly established 
ordinary objections doctrine non resistance old new testaments brought forward expulsion moneychangers temple arguments follow disproof 
practical reasonableness rule conduct shown independently scripture objections ordinarily made practicability stated refuted 
thus one chapter book treats non resistance exceptional cases owns connection cases rule non resistance impossible application would prove law universally authoritative 
quoting cases shows precisely application rule necessary reasonable 
aspect question either side opponents followed writings 
mention show unmistakable interest works ought men make profession christianity one would thought ballou work would well known ideas expressed would lave either accepted refuted case 
work garrison father foundation society non resistants declaration even correspondence quakers convinced fact departure ruling form christianity law christ non resistance force error long observed pointed men labored still laboring correct 
ballou work confirmed still view

ballou died august obituary notice american journal christian views religio philosophical journal august

soon appearance book german received letter prague professor university informing existence work never yet printed helchitsky tsech fifteenth century entitled net faith 
work professor told helchitsky expressed precisely view true false christianity expressed book believe 
professor wrote helchitsky work published first time tsech language journal petersburg academy silence 
since could obtain book tried make acquainted known helchitsky gained following information german book sent prague professor pypin history tsech literature 
pypin account net faith christ teaching ought draw man dark depths sea worldliness iniquity 
true faith consists believing god word time come men mistake true faith heresy therefore reason point true faith consists anyone know 
hidden darkness men recognize true law christ 
make law plain helchitsky points primitive organization christian society organization says regarded roman church abominable heresy 
primitive church special ideal social organization founded equality liberty fraternity 
christianity helchitsky view still preserves elements necessary society return pure doctrine render unnecessary every form social order kings popes essential law love would alone sufficient every case 
historically helchitsky attributes degeneration christianity times constantine great pope sylvester admitted christian church heathen morals life 
constantine turn endowed pope worldly riches power 
time forward two ruling powers constantly aiding one another strive nothing outward glory 
divines ecclesiastical dignitaries began concern subduing whole world authority incited men one another murder plunder creed life reduced christianity nullity 
helchitsky denies completely right make war inflict punishment death every soldier even knight violent evil doer murderer 
account given german book addition biographical details extracts helchitsky writings 
learned drift helchitsky teaching way awaited impatiently appearance net faith journal academy 
one year passed two three still book appear 
learned printing book begun stopped

marvelous book every point view 
general tenor given perfect accuracy pypin 
helchitsky fundamental idea christianity allying temporal power days constantine continuing develop conditions become completely distorted ceased christian altogether 
helchitsky gave title net faith book taking motto verse gospel calling disciples fishers men developing metaphor says christ means disciples would caught world net faith greater fishes broke net escaped rest slipped holes made greater fishes net remained quite empty 
greater fishes broke net rulers emperors popes kings renounced power instead true christianity put simply mask 
helchitsky teaches precisely taught days non resistant mennonites quakers former tunes bogomilites paulicians many others 
teaches christianity expecting adherents gentleness meekness peaceableness forgiveness injuries turning cheek one struck love enemies inconsistent use force indispensable condition authority 
christian according helchitsky reasoning ruler soldier take part government trade even landowner artisan husbandman 
book one works attacking official christianity escaped burned 
called heretical works burned stake together authors ancient works exposing errors official christianity 
book special interest reason alone 
apart interest every point view one remarkable products thought depth aim astounding strength beauty national language written antiquity 
yet four centuries remained unprinted still unknown except learned specialists 
one would thought works whether quakers garrison ballou helchitsky asserting proving principles gospel modern world takes false view christ teaching would awakened interest excitement talk discussion among spiritual teachers flocks alike 
works kind dealing essence christian doctrine ought one would thought examined accepted true refuted rejected 
nothing kind occurred fate repeated works 
men diverse views believers surprising unbelieving liberals also though agreement preserve persistent silence done people explain true meaning christ doctrine remains either ignored forgotten 
still astonishing two books heard appearance book little known mean dymond book war published first time london daniel musser book non resistance written 
particularly astonishing books unknown apart intrinsic merits books treat much theory practical application theory life attitude christianity military service especially important interesting clays universal conscription 
people ask perhaps ought subject behave believes war inconsistent religion government demands enter military service question think vital one answer specially important days universal conscription 
least great majority people christians men called upon military service 
ought man christian meet demand gist dymond answer duty humbly steadfastly refuse serve 
people without definite reasoning conclude straightway responsibility government measures rests entirely resolve governments sovereigns decide question good bad subjects duty subjects merely obey 
think arguments kind obscure men conscience 
take part councils government therefore responsible misdeeds 

indeed responsible misdeeds 
misdeeds rulers become knowing misdeeds assist carrying 
suppose bound obey government responsibility misdeeds commit transferred rulers deceive 
say give acts others acts good bad merit good responsibility evil actions since done 
remarkable thing said instructions soldiers make learn officer alone responsible consequences command 
right 
man get rid responsibility actions 
clear following example 
officer commands kill neighbor child kill father mother would obey would obey whole argument falls ground disobey governors one case draw line obey line laid christianity line reasonable practicable 
therefore consider duty every man thinks war inconsistent christianity meekly firmly refuse serve army 
let whose lot act thus remember fulfillment great duty rests 
destiny humanity world depends far depends men fidelity religion 
let confess conviction stand words alone sufferings need 
believe christ forbade murder pay heed arguments commands call bear hand 
steadfast refusal make use force call blessing promised hear sayings time come world recognize aided reformation mankind 
musser book called non resistance asserted kingdom christ kingdoms world separated 
book devoted question written american government exacting military service citizens time civil war 
value time dealing question circumstances people refuse eater military service 
tenor author introductory remarks well known many persons united states refuse fight grounds conscience 
called defenseless non resistant christians 
christians refuse defend country bear arms call government make war enemies 
till lately religious scruple seemed valid excuse government urged let service 
beginning civil war public opinion agitated subject 
natural persons considered duty bear hardships dangers war defense country feel resentment persons long shared advantages protection government time need danger would share bearing labors dangers defense 
even natural declare attitude men monstrous irrational suspicious 
host orators writers author tells us arose oppose attitude tried prove sinfulness non resistance scripture common sense grounds 
perfectly natural many cases authors right right regard persons renounce benefits received government tried avoid hardships military service right regard principle non resistance 
author proves binding nature rule non resistance christian pointing command perfectly clear enjoined upon every christian christ without possibility misinterpretation 
bethink whether righteous obey man god said peter john 
precisely ought attitude every man wishes christian claim military service christ said resist evil force 
question principle author regards decided 
second question whether people right refuse serve army refused benefits conferred government resting force author considers detail arrives conclusion christian following law christ since go war ought either take advantage institutions government courts law elections private concerns must recourse authorities police law 
book treats relation old testament new value government christians makes observations doctrine non resistance attacks made 
author concludes book saying christians need government therefore either obey contrary christ teaching still less take part 
christ took disciples world says 
expect worldly blessings worldly happiness expect eternal life 
spirit live makes contented happy every position 
world tolerates always happy 
world leave peace go elsewhere since pilgrims earth fixed place habitation 
believe dead may bury dead 
one thing needful follow master 
even putting aside question principle laid two books christian duty attitude war one help perceiving practical importance urgent need deciding question 
people hundreds thousands quakers mennonites douhobortsi molokani others belong definite sect consider use force consequently military service inconsistent christianity 
consequently every year among us russia men called upon military service refuse serve ground religious convictions 
government let 
compel go case disobedience punish 
government treated 
extract diary nicholas myravyov kars passed censor known russia tiflis october 
morning commandant told five peasants belonging landowner tamboff government lately sent georgia 
men sent soldiers would serve several times flogged made run gauntlet would submit readily cruelest tortures even death rather serve 
let us go said leave us alone hurt anyone men equal tzar man like us pay tribute expose life danger kill battle man done harm cut us pieces soldiers 
compassion us give us charity government rations want words peasants declare numbers like russia 
brought four times committee ministers last decided lay matter tzar gave orders taken georgia correction commanded commander chief send report every month gradual success bringing peasants better mind 
correction ended known whole episode indeed unknown kept profound secrecy 
government behaved seventy five years ago behaved great cumber cases studiously concealed people 
government behaves except case german mennonites living province kherson whose plea military service considered well grounded 
made work term service labor forests 
recent cases refusal part mennonites serve army religious grounds government authorities acted following manner begin recourse every means coercion used times correct culprit bring better mind measures carried greatest secrecy 
know case one man declined serve moscow official correspondence subject two months refusal accumulated big folio kept absolutely secret among ministry 
usually begin sending culprit priests latter shame said always exhort obedience 
since exhortation christ name forswear christ part unsuccessful received admonitions spiritual authorities send gendarmes latter finding rule political cause offense dispatch back sent learned men doctors madhouse 
vicissitudes deprived liberty endure every kind humiliation suffering convicted criminal 
repeated four cases 
doctors let madhouse every kind secret shift employed prevent going free whereby others would encouraged refuse serve done time avoid leaving among soldiers fear learn military service duty law god assured quite contrary 
convenient thing government would kill non resistant flogging death means done former days 
put man openly death believes creed confess impossible 
let man alone refused obedience also impossible 
government tries either compel man ill treatment renounce christ way get rid unobserved without openly putting death hide somehow action man people 
kinds shifts wiles cruelties set foot 
either send frontier provoke insubordination try breach discipline shut prison disciplinary battalion ill treat freely unseen anyone declare mad lock lunatic asylum

everywhere story repeated 
government great majority liberal advanced people called studiously turn away everything said written done done men prove incompatibility force awful gross glaring form form army soldiers prepared murder anyone whoever may teachings christianity even humanity society professes creed

chapter ii 
criticisms doctrine non resistance evil force part believers unbelievers 
fate book believe evasive character religious criticisms principles book st reply use force opposed christianity reply use force necessary restrain evil doers reply duty using force defense one neighbor th reply breach command nonresistance regarded simply weakness th reply reply evaded making believe question long decided devise subterfuges take refuge behind authority church antiquity religion ecclesiastical critics get contradiction use force christianity theory practice general attitude ecclesiastical world authorities profession true christianity general character russian freethinking critics foreign freethinking critics mistaken arguments critics result misunderstanding true meaning christ teaching 
impression gained desire conceal hush tried express book led judge book afresh 
appearance anticipated forbidden ought therefore law burnt 
time discussed among officials circulated great number manuscript lithograph copies translations printed abroad 
quickly book criticisms religious secular character made appearance government tolerated even encouraged 
refutation book one supposed know anything even chosen subject theological dissertations academies 
criticisms book russian foreign alike fall two general divisions religious criticisms men regard believers secular criticisms freethinkers 
begin first class 
book made accusation teachers church teaching opposed christ commands clearly definitely expressed sermon mount opposed especial command regard resistance evil way deprive christ teaching value 
church authorities accept teaching sermon mount non resistance evil force divine revelation therefore one would thought felt called upon write book would found inevitable everything else reply principal point charge say plainly admit teaching sermon mount commandment non resistance evil binding christian 
bound answer question usual fashion e although one side one absolutely deny yet side one main fully assent seeing etc etc 
answered question plainly put book christ really demand disciples carry taught sermon mount christian always remaining christian go law make use law seek protection law christian remaining christian take part administration government using compulsion neighbors important question hanging heads us days universal military service christian remaining christian christ direct prohibition promise obedience future actions directly opposed teaching taking share service army prepare murder men even actually murder questions put plainly directly seemed require plain direct answer criticisms book plain direct answer 
book received precisely treatment attacks upon teachers church defection law christ history days constantine full 
great deal said connection book incorrectly interpreted passages gospel error recognizing trinity redemption immortality soul 
great deal said word one thing every christian essential question life reconcile duty forgiveness meekness patience love neighbors enemies alike clearly expressed words teacher heart us reconcile duty obligation using force war upon men foreign people 
worth calling answers question brought following five heads 
tried bring together connection could criticisms book written past times theme 
first crudest form reply consists bold assertion use force opposed teaching christ permitted even enjoined christian old new testaments 
assertions kind proceed part men attained highest ranks governing ecclesiastical hierarchy consequently perfectly assured one dare contradict assertion anyone contradict hear nothing contradiction 
men part intoxication power lost right idea christianity name hold position christian christianity presents heresy everything old new testaments distorted antichristian heathen meaning regard foundation christianity 
support assertion christianity opposed use force men usually greatest audacity bring together obscure passages old new testaments interpreting unchristian way punishment ananias sapphira simon sorcerer etc 
quote sayings christ possibly interpreted justification cruelty expulsion temple shall tolerable land sodom city etc etc 
according people notions christian government least bound guided spirit peace forgiveness injuries love enemies 
refute assertion useless people make assertion refute rather renounce christ inventing christianity christ place whose name church exists well office 
men learn church professes believe christ punishment warfare forgiveness one would believe church could prove anyone trying prove 
second somewhat less gross form argument consists declaring though christ indeed preach turn left cheek give cloak also highest moral duty yet wicked men world wicked men mere restrained force whole world good men would come ruin 
argument found first time john chrysostom slow mistaken book believe 
argument ill grounded allow regard men intrinsically wicked men first place annul whole idea christian teaching according equals brothers sons one father heaven 
secondly ill founded even use force wicked men permitted god since impossible find perfect unfailing distinction one could positively know wicked good would come individual men societies men mutually regarding wicked men case 
thirdly even possible distinguish wicked good unfailingly even would impossible kill injure shut prison wicked men would one christian society carry punishment since every christian christian commanded use force wicked 
third kind answer still subtle preceding consists asserting though command non resistance evil force binding christian evil directed personally ceases binding evil directed neighbors christian bound fulfill commandment even bound act opposition defense neighbors use force transgressors force 
assertion absolute assumption one find christ teaching confirmation argument 
argument limitation direct contradiction negation commandment 
every man right recourse force face danger threatening question use force reduced question definition danger another 
private judgment decide question danger another occasion use force could justified ground danger threatening man 
killed burnt witches killed aristocrats girondists killed enemies authority regarded dangerous people 
important limitation fundamentally undermines whole value commandment entered christ meaning must mention somewhere 
restriction made nowhere saviour life preaching 
contrary warning given precisely treacherous scandalous restriction nullifies commandment 
error impossibility limitation shown gospel special clearness account judgment caiaphas makes precisely distinction 
acknowledged wrong punish innocent jesus saw source danger whole people therefore said better one man die whole people perish 
erroneousness limitation still clearly expressed words spoken peter tried resist force evil directed jesus matt 
xxvi 

peter defending beloved heavenly master 
christ reproved saying takes sword shall perish sword 
besides apologies violence used one neighbor defense another neighbor greater violence always untrustworthy force used one yet carried evil intent never know would greater evil act violence act want prevent 
kill criminal society may rid never know whether criminal day would changed man tomorrow whether punishment useless cruelty 
shut dangerous think member society next day man might cease dangerous imprisonment might nothing 
see man know ruffian pursuing young girl 
gun hand kill ruffian save girl 
death wounding ruffian positively taken place would happened know 
immense mass evil must result indeed result allowing men assume right anticipating may happen 
ninety nine per cent evil world founded reasoning inquisition dynamite bombs executions punishments tens thousands political criminals 
fourth still refined reply question ought christian attitude christ command non resistance evil force consists declaring deny command non resisting evil recognize ascribe command special exclusive value attached sectarians 
regard command indispensable condition christian life garrison ballou dymond quakers mennonites shakers moravian brothers waldenses albigenses bogomilites paulicians past one sided heresy 
command neither less value commands man weakness transgresses command whatever command non resistance included cease christian hold true faith 
skillful device many people wish deceived easily deceived 
device consists reducing direct conscious denial command casual breach 
one need compare attitude teachers church commands really recognize convinced attitude completely different attitude duties 
command fornication really recognize consequently admit case fornication cease wrong 
church preachers never point cases command fornication broken always teach must avoid seductions lead temptation fornication 
command non resistance 
church preachers recognize cases command broken teach people accordingly 
teach teat avoid temptations break chief military oath administer 
preachers church never case advocate breaking commandment 
connection commandment non resistance openly teach must understand literally conditions circumstances must direct opposite go law fight punish 
occasions fulfilling commandment nonresistance evil force taught part occasions fulfilling 
fulfillment command say difficult pertains perfection 
difficult breach forbidden law courts prisons cannons guns armies wars immediate sanction church true command recognized preachers church level commands

obvious appearing midst jewish heathen world teaching could accepted majority men living life absolutely different required 
obvious even accepted absolutely opposed old views could comprehensible full significance 
succession misunderstandings errors partial explanations corrections additions generations meaning christian doctrine grown continually clear men 
christian view life exerted influence jewish heathen heathen jewish view life exerted influence christian 
christianity living force gained upon extinct judaism heathenism grown continually clearer clearer freed admixture falsehood overlaid 
men went attainment meaning christianity realized life 
longer mankind lived clearer clearer became meaning christianity must always case every theory life 
succeeding generations corrected errors predecessors grew ever nearer nearer comprehension true meaning 
thus earliest times christianity 
earliest times christianity men began assert authority meaning attribute doctrine true one proof bring forward supernatural occurrences support correctness interpretation 
principal cause first misunderstanding doctrine afterward complete distortion 
supposed christ teaching transmitted men like every truth special miraculous way 
thus truth teaching proved correspondence needs mind whole nature man miraculous manner transmission advanced irrefutable proof truth interpretation put 
hypothesis originated misunderstanding teaching result make impossible understand rightly 
happened first earliest times doctrine still fully understood often interpreted wrongly see gospels acts 
less doctrine understood obscure appeared necessary external proofs truth 
proposition ought unto others would unto us need proved miracles needed exercise faith proposition convincing harmony man mind nature proposition christ god proved miracles completely beyond comprehension 
understanding christ teaching obscured miraculous introduced miraculous introduced doctrine strained meaning obscure became strained meaning obscure became strongly infallibility asserted less comprehensible doctrine became 
one see gospels acts epistles earliest times non comprehension doctrine called forth need proofs miraculous incomprehensible 
first example book acts assembly gathered together jerusalem decide question arisen whether baptize uncircumcised eaten food sacrificed idols 
fact question raised showed discussed understand teaching christ rejected outward observances ablutions purifications fasts sabbaths 
plainly said goeth man mouth cometh man mouth defileth therefore question baptizing uncircumcised could arisen among men though loved master dimly felt grandeur teaching still understand teaching clearly 
fact 
proportion failure members assembly understand doctrine need external confirmation incomplete interpretation 
settle question asking proved misunderstanding doctrine uttered assembly described acts strange phrase first time found necessary give external confirmation certain assertions productive much evil 
asserted correctness decided guaranteed miraculous participation holy ghost god decision 
assertion holy ghost god spoke apostles turn wanted proof 
thus necessary confirm holy ghost descend pentecost tongues fire upon made assertion 
account descent holy ghost precedes assembly book acts written much later events 
descent holy ghost proved seen tongues fire though easy understand tongue fire burning man head prove man going say infallibly truth 
arose necessity still miracles changes raisings dead life strikings living dead marvels stumbling block men acts full far ever convincing one truth christian doctrine repel men 
result means confirming truth confirmations truth tales miracles heaped one another doctrine distorted original meaning aid incomprehensible became 
thus earliest times went constantly increasing till reached day logical climax dogmas transubstantiation infallibility pope bishops scripture requiring blind faith rendered incomprehensible utterly meaningless god christ doctrine person catholicism persons greek orthodoxy book protestantism 
widely christianity diffused greater number people unprepared brought sway less understood absolutely infallibility insisted less possible became understand true meaning doctrine 
times constantine whole interpretation doctrine already reduced r sum supported temporal authority disputes taken place council creed reckoned believe end one holy apostolic church means infallibility persons call church 
amounts man longer believing god christ revealed believing church orders believe 
church holy church founded christ 
god could leave men interpret teaching random therefore founded church 
statements utterly untrue unfounded one ashamed refute 
nowhere anything except assertion church find god christ founded anything like churchmen understand church 
gospels warning church external authority warning clear obvious passage said christ followers call man master 
nowhere anything said foundation churchmen call church 
word church used twice gospels sense assembly men decide dispute time connection obscure utterance stone peter gates hell 
two passages word church used signification merely assembly deduced understand church 
christ could founded church understand word 
nothing like idea church know sacraments miracles claim infallibility found either christ words ideas men time

basement one judge effect spire 
learned critics day try 
share erroneous idea orthodox believers possession certain infallible means investigating subject 
fancy apply called scientific methods criticism doubt conclusion correct 
testing subject fancied infallible method science principal obstacle understanding christian religion unbelievers called educated people 
follow mistakes made scientific men christian religion especially two strange misconceptions everything else hinder correct understanding 
one misconceptions christian moral teaching carried therefore either force accepted rule conduct must transformed adapted limits within fulfillment possible society 
another misconception christian doctrine love god therefore service obscure mystic principle gives definite object love therefore replaced exact comprehensible principles love men service humanity 
first misconception regard impossibility following principle result men state conception life unconsciously taking conception standard christian religion directs men taking christian principle perfection rule life ordered think say follow christ teaching impossible complete fulfillment required teaching would put end life 
man carry christ teaches would destroy life men carried human race would come end say 
take thought morrow shall eat shall drink wherewithal shall clothed defend life resist evil force lay life others observe perfect chastity human race exist say 
perfectly right take principle perfection given christ teaching rule everyone bound fulfill state principles life everyone bound carry rule paying taxes supporting law 
misconception based precisely fact teaching christ guides men differently way precepts founded lower conception life guide men 
precepts state conception life guide men requiring exact fulfillment rules laws 
christ teaching guides men pointing infinite perfection heavenly father every man independently voluntarily struggles whatever degree imperfection present 
misunderstanding men judge christian principle point view state principle consists fact supposition perfection christ points fully attained ask ask question supposition state laws carried result carried supposition made perfection held christians infinite never attained christ lays principle view fact absolute perfection never attained striving toward absolute infinite perfection continually increase blessedness men blessedness may increased infinity thereby 
christ teaching angels men living moving animal life 
animal force movement christ applies new force recognition divide perfection thereby directs movement resultant two forces 

suppose human life going direction christ pointed like supposing little boat afloat rabid river directing course almost exactly current progress direction 
christ recognizes existence sides parallelogram eternal indestructible forces life man compounded force animal nature force consciousness kinship god 
saying nothing animal force asserts remains always therefore independent human christ speaks divine force calling upon man know closely set free retards carry higher degree intensity 
process liberating strengthening force true life man according christ teaching consists 
true life according preceding religions consists carrying rules law according christ teaching consists ever closer approximation divine perfection hell every man recognized within every man ever closer closer approach perfect fusion god fusion toward man strives attainment would destruction life know 
divine perfection asymptote human life always striving always approaching though reached infinity 
christian religion seems exclude possibility life men mistake pointing ideal laying rule 
principles presented christ teaching appear destructive life 
principles contrary ones make true life possible 
without principles true life could possible 
one ought expect much people usually say discussing requirements christian religion 
one expect take absolutely thought morrow said gospel take much thought one give away poor one must give away certain definite part one need aim virginity one must avoid debauchery one need forsake wife children one must give great place one heart 
speak like like telling man struggling swift river directing course current impossible cross river rowing current cross must float direction point wants reach 
reality order reach place wants go must row strength toward point much higher 
let go requirements ideal means diminish possibility perfection make end ideal 
ideal power men ideal invented someone ideal every man carries within soul 
ideal complete infinite perfection power men stimulates action 
moderate perfection loses power influencing men hearts 
christ teaching power demands absolute perfection fusion divine nature exists every man soul god union son father 
life according christ teaching consists nothing setting free son god existing every man animal bringing closer father 
animal existence man constitute human life alone 
life according god also human life 
human life combination animal life divine life 
combination approaches divine life life 
life according christian religion progress toward divine perfection 
one condition according doctrine higher lower another 
every condition according doctrine particular stage consequence way toward unattainable perfection therefore imply greater lesser degree life 
increase life according consists nothing quickening progress toward perfection 
therefore progress toward perfection publican zaccheus woman sinner robber cross implies higher degree life stagnant righteousness pharisee 
therefore religion rules obligatory obey 
man lower level moving onward toward perfection living moral better life fully carrying christ teaching man much higher level morality moving onward toward perfection 
sense lost sheep dearer father lost 
prodigal son piece money lost found precious lost 
fulfillment christ teaching consists moving away self toward god 
obvious definite laws rules fulfillment teaching 
every degree perfection every degree imperfection equal obedience laws constitutes fulfillment doctrine therefore binding rules laws 
fundamental distinction religion christ preceding religions based state conception life follows corresponding difference special precepts state theory christian precepts 
precepts state theory life insist part certain practical prescribed acts men justified secure right 
christian precepts commandment love precept strict sense word expression essence religion five commandments sermon mount negative character 
show certain stage development humanity men may 
commandments signposts endless road perfection toward humanity moving showing point perfection possible certain period development humanity 
christ given expression sermon mount eternal ideal toward men spontaneously struggling also degree attainment men may reach times 
ideal desire ill anyone provoke ill love men 
precept showing level fall attainment ideal prohibition evil speaking 
first command 
ideal perfect chastity even thought 
precept showing level fall attainment ideal purity married life avoidance debauchery 
second command 
ideal take thought future live present moment 
precept showing level fall prohibition swearing promising anything future 
third command 
ideal never purpose use force 
precept showing level fall returning good evil patient wrong giving cloak also 
fourth command 
ideal love enemies hate us 
precept showing level fall evil enemies speak well make difference neighbors 
precepts indications journey perfection already fully able avoid must labor attain ought degrees translate instinctive unconscious habits 
precepts far constituting whole christ teaching exhausting simply stages way perfection 
precepts must followed higher higher precepts way perfection held religion 
therefore essentially part christian religion make demands higher expressed precepts means diminish demands either ideal precepts people imagine judge standpoint social conception life 
much one misunderstanding scientific men relation import aim christ teaching 
another misunderstanding arising source consists substituting love men service humanity christian principles love god service 
christian doctrine love god serve result love love serve one neighbor seems scientific men obscure mystic arbitrary 
would absolutely exclude obligation love service god holding doctrine love men humanity alone far clear tangible reasonable 
scientific men teach theory good rational life devoted service whole humanity 
import christian doctrine reduce christ teaching 
seek confirmation doctrine gospel supposition two doctrines really 
idea absolutely mistaken one 
christian doctrine nothing common doctrine positivists communists apostles universal brotherhood mankind based general advantage brotherhood 
differ one another especially christianity firm clear basis human soul love humanity theoretical deduction analogy 
doctrine love humanity alone based social conception life 
essence social conception life consists transference aim individual life life societies individuals family clan tribe state 
transference accomplished easily naturally earliest forms transference aim life individual family clan 
transference tribe nation difficult requires special training 
transference sentiment state furthest limit process reach 
love one self natural everyone one needs encouragement 
love one clan support protect one love one wife joy help one existence one children hope consolation one life one parents given one life education natural 
love though far strong love self met pretty often 
love one sake personal pride one tribe one nation though natural nevertheless common 
love one people blood tongue religion one self possible though far strong love self even love family clan 
love state turkey germany england austria russia thing almost impossible 
though zealously inculcated imagined sentiment existence reality

positivists however apostles fraternity scientific principles without taking consideration weakening sentiment proportion extension object draw deductions theory direction 
since say advantage individual extend personal interest family tribe subsequently nation state would still advantageous extend interest societies men whole mankind live humanity men live family state 
theoretically follows indeed extended love interest personality family tribe thence nation state would perfectly logical men save strife calamities result division mankind nations states extending love whole humanity 
would logical theoretically nothing would appear natural advocates observe love sentiment may may felt useless advocate moreover love must object humanity object

humanity fiction impossible love 
would doubtless advantageous men could love humanity love family 
would advantageous communists advocate replace competitive individualistic organization men activity social universal organization would 
motives lead men 
positivists communists apostles fraternity scientific principles advocate extension whole humanity love men feel families state 
forget love discussing personal love might expand rarefied form embrace man native country disappears embrace artificial state austria england turkey even conceive relation humanity absolutely mystic conception 
man loves animal personality loves family even loves native country 
love humanity would excellent thing 
way precisely taught christianity 
think advocates positivist communistic socialistic fraternity 
would indeed excellent thing 
never love based personal social conception life never rise beyond love state 
fallacy argument lies fact social conception life love family nation founded rests love self love grows weaker weaker extended self family tribe nationality slate state reach furthest limit beyond go 
necessity extending sphere love beyond dispute 
reality possibility love destroyed necessity extending object indefinitely 
thus insufficiency personal human love made manifest 
advocates positivist communistic socialistic fraternity propose draw upon christian love make default bankrupt human love christian love results foundations 
propose love humanity alone apart love god 
love exist 
motive produce 
christian love result christian conception life aim life love serve god 
social conception life led men natural transition love self family tribe nation state consciousness necessity love humanity conception definite limits extends living things 
necessity love awakens kind sentiment man contradiction solved social theory life 
christian doctrine full significance alone solve giving new meaning life 
christianity recognizes love self family nation humanity humanity everything living everything existing recognizes necessity infinite extension sphere love 
object love found outside self societies individuals external world within self divine self whose essence love animal self brought feel need consciousness perishable nature 
difference christian doctrine preceded social doctrine said live opposition nature understanding animal nature make subject external law family society state 
christianity says live according nature understanding divine nature make subject anything neither animal self others attain aim striving subject external self 
christian doctrine brings man elementary consciousness self animal self divine self divine spark self son god much god father though confined animal husk 
consciousness son god whose chief characteristic love satisfies need extension sphere love man social conception life brought 
latter welfare personality demanded ever widening extension sphere love love necessity confined certain objects self family society 
christian conception life love necessity confined object essential faculty human soul 
man loves interest love love essence soul love 
christian doctrine shows man essence soul love happiness depends loving object loving principle whole god recognizes within love therefore loves things men 
fundamental difference christian doctrine doctrine positivists theorizers universal brotherhood non christian principles 
two principal misunderstandings relating christian religion greater number false reasonings proceed 
first consists belief christ teaching instructs men like previous religions rules bound follow rules fulfilled 
second idea whole purport christianity teach men live advantageously together one family attain need follow rule love humanity dismissing thought love god altogether 
mistaken notion scientific men essence christianity consists supernatural moral teaching impracticable constitutes another reason failure men present day understand christianity

public opinion prepared accept moreover international relations different peoples make acceptance possible 
disarmament imposed one nation another circumstances threatening security would equivalent declaration war 
however one may admit exchange ideas nations interested could aid certain degree bringing good understanding indispensable negotiations would render possible considerable reduction military expenditure crushing nations europe greatly hindering solution social question individually must solve pain internal war price escaping externally

life goes growing complex developing direction increases inconsistencies sufferings men brings limit beyond go 
furthest limit inconsistency universal compulsory military service 
usually supposed universal military service increased armaments connected well resulting increase taxes national debts passing phenomenon produced particular political situation europe may removed certain political combinations without modification inner order life 
absolutely incorrect 
universal military service internal inconsistency inherent social conception life carried furthest limits becoming evident certain stage material development reached 
social conception life seen consists transfer aim life individual groups maintenance tribe family race state 
social conception life supposed since aim life found groups individuals individuals voluntarily sacrifice interests interests group 
still fact certain groups distinction primitive forms association family tribe race even patriarchal state 
tradition handed education supported religious sentiment individuals without compulsion merged interests interest group sacrificed good general welfare 
complex larger societies become especially often conquest becomes cause amalgamation people state often individuals strive attain aims public expense often becomes necessary restrain insubordinate individuals recourse authority violence 
champions social conception life usually try connect idea authority violence idea moral influence connection quite impossible 
effect moral influence man change desires bend direction duty required 
man controlled moral influence acts accordance desires 
authority sense word ordinarily understood means forcing man act opposition desires 
man submits authority chooses obliged authority 
nothing oblige man choose except physical force threat deprivation freedom blows imprisonment threats easily carried punishments 
authority consists always consisted

nero ghenghis khan day even liberal government republics united states france 
men submit authority liable punishments case non submission 
state obligations payment taxes fulfillment state duties submission punishments exile fines etc people appear submit voluntarily always based bodily violence threat 
basis authority bodily violence 
possibility applying bodily violence people provided organization armed men trained act unison submission one

army always still basis power 
power always hands control army men power roman caesars russian german emperors take interest army anything court popularity army knowing side power secure 
formation aggrandizement army indispensable maintenance authority introduced social conception life principle destroying 
object authority justification existence lie restraint aim attaining personal interests detriment interests society 
however power gained possess way different men therefore disposed others subordinate interests society 
contrary power disposal disposed others subordinate public interests 
whatever means men devised preventing authority riding public interests benefit intrusting power faultless people far succeeded either aims 
methods appointing authorities tried divine right election heredity balloting assemblies parliaments senate proved ineffectual 
everyone knows one methods attains aim either intrusting power incorruptible preventing power abused 
everyone knows contrary men authority emperors ministers governors police officers always simply possession power liable demoralized subordinate public interests personal aims power 
indeed could otherwise 
state conception life could justified long men voluntarily sacrificed personal interests public welfare 
soon individuals would voluntarily sacrifice interests authority violence needed restrain disintegrating principle coercion one set people another set entered social conception organization based 
authority one set men another attain object restraining override public interests personal ends power ought put hands impeccable supposed among chinese supposed middle ages even supposed believe consecration anointing 
conditions could social organization justified 
since case contrary men power always far saints fact possession power social organization based power justification 
even time owing low standard morals disposition men violence existence authority restrain violence advantage violence government less violence individuals one see advantage could lasting 
disposition individuals violence diminished habits people became civilized power grew social organization demoralized lack restraint advantage disappeared 
whole history last two thousand years nothing history gradual change relation moral development masses one hand demoralization governments 
put simply come pass 
men lived families tribes races feud one another plundering outraging killing one another 
violent hostilities carried large small scale man man family family tribe tribe race race people people 
larger stronger groups conquered absorbed weaker larger stronger became internal feuds disappeared continuity group seemed assured 
members family tribe united one community less hostile among families tribes die like one man continuity existence 
members one state subject single authority strife individuals seems still less life state seems even secure 
association larger larger groups result conscious recognition benefits associations said story varyagi 
produced one hand natural growth population struggle conquest 
conquest power emperor puts end internal dissensions state conception life justifies 
justification never temporary 
internal dissensions disappear proportion degree oppression exerted authority dissentient individuals 
violence internal feud crushed authority reappears authority falls hands men like rest frequently always ready sacrifice public welfare personal interest difference subjects resist thus exposed demoralizing influence authority 
thus evil violence passes hands authority always growing growing time becomes greater evil supposed suppress time tendency violence members society becomes weaker weaker violence authority less less needed 
government authority even suppress private violence always introduces life men fresh forms violence tend become greater greater proportion duration strength government 
though violence power less noticeable government employed members society one another finds expression submission strife nevertheless exists often greater degree former days 
could otherwise since apart demoralizing influence power policy even unconscious tendency power always reduce subjects extreme weakness weaker oppressed less effort need made keep subjection 
therefore oppression oppressed always goes growing furthest limit beyond go without killing goose golden eggs 
goose lays eggs like american indians negroes fijians killed spite sincere protests philanthropists

except state say exposed attacks evil disposed persons country 
evil disposed persons midst whose attacks preserved state army even three four centuries ago men prided warlike prowess killing men considered heroic achievement persons know well persons nowadays carry use firearms everyone professes humane principles feels sympathy fellows wants nothing left peace enjoy existence undisturbed 
nowadays special malefactors state could defend us 
evil disposed persons meant men punished criminals know well different kind like wild beasts among sheep men like naturally inclined crimes commit 
know threats punishments diminish number done change environment moral influence 
justification state violence ground protection gives us evil disposed persons even foundation three four centuries ago none whatever 
present one would rather say contrary action state cruel methods punishment behind general moral standard age prisons galleys gibbets guillotines tends rather brutalize people civilize consequently rather increase diminish number malefactors 
except state tell us religion education culture means communication 
without state men would able form social institutions needed thing 
argument well founded centuries ago

doctrine non resistance evil force must inevitably accepted men present day 
christianity system rules new conception life therefore obligatory accepted true significance christianity moreover prophetic destruction pagan life therefore necessity acceptance christian doctrines non resistance evil force one aspect christian doctrine must inevitably times accepted men two methods deciding every quarrel first method find universal definition evil must accept resist evil force second method christian one complete non resistance force though failure first method recognized since early days christianity still proposed mankind progressed become evident universal definition evil recognized present day force still used resist evil regarded right people know avoid difficulty avoiding result subtle complex character government use force force used four ways intimidation bribery hypnotism coercion force arms state violence never suppressed forcible overthrow government men led sufferings pagan mode life necessity accepting christ teaching doctrine non resistance force consciousness truth diffused throughout society also bring acceptance consciousness complete contradiction life specially obvious compulsory military service habit application four methods violence state men see inconsistency christianity life soldier even see though authorities show immorality soldier duties perfect clearness call military service supreme test every man choice offered adopting christian doctrine non resistance slavishly submitting existing state organization men usually renounce hold sacred submit demands government seeming see course open men pagan conception life course open never spite growing horrors war society made men must perish social reorganization save pagan life reached extreme limit annihilate 
often said christianity truth ought accepted everyone directly appeared ought transformed men lives better 
like saying seed ripe ought bring forth stalls flower fruit 
christian religion legal system imposed violence may transform men lives 
christianity new higher conception life

christianity doctrine truth prophecy 
eighteen centuries ago christianity revealed men truth ought live time foretold human life would become men would live continued live previous principles would become accepted christian doctrine carried lives 
laying sermon mount principles guide men lives christ said whosoever heareth sayings mine doeth liken unto wise man built house upon rock rain descended floods came winds blew beat upon house fell founded upon rock 
everyone heareth sayings doeth shall likened unto foolish man built house upon sand rain descended floods came winds blew beat upon house fell great fall matt

eighteen centuries prophecy fulfilled 
followed christ teaching generally application social life non resistance evil men brought spite inevitable destruction foretold christ fulfill teaching 
people often think question non resistance evil force theoretical one neglected 
yet question presented life men calls answer every thinking man 
ever since christianity outwardly professed question men social life like question presents traveler road journeying divides two branches 
must go say think go 
one road two must make choice 
way since christ teaching known men say live decide question resistance non resistance evil force 
every new struggle arises one must inevitably decide resist force regard evil 
question resistance non resistance evil arose first conflict men took place since every conflict nothing else resistance force combatants regards evil 
christ men see resistance force regards evil simply one thinks evil thinks good one methods settling dispute another method resisting evil force 
christ teaching seemed men one means settling dispute resistance evil force 
acted accordingly combatants trying convince others respectively regards evil actually absolutely evil 
earliest time men devised definitions evil tried make binding everyone 
definitions evil sometimes took form laws supposed received supernatural means sometimes commands rulers assemblies infallibility attributed 
men resorted violence others convinced others directing violence evil recognized 
means employed earliest times especially gained possession authority long irrationality detected 
longer men lived world complex relations became evident resist force regarded evil irrational conflict way lessened thereby human definitions succeed making regard evil accepted others 
already time christianity arose evident great number people roman empire arose regarded evil nero caligula could regarded evil others 
even time men begun understand human laws though given divine laws compiled men infallible whatever external majesty invested erring men rendered infallible assembling together calling senate name 
even time felt understood many 
christ preached doctrine consisted prohibition resistance evil force gave new conception life means putting end conflict men making duty one section mankind submit without conflict prescribed certain authorities making duty consequently authority resort force anyone circumstances 
doctrine accepted time small number disciples 
majority men especially power even nominal acceptance christianity continued maintain principle resistance force regarded evil 
roman byzantine emperors continued later 
insufficiency principle authoritative definition evil resistance force evident early ages christianity becomes still obvious division roman empire many states equal authority hostilities internal conflicts broke within 
men ready accept solution given christ old definitions evil ought resisted continued laid means making laws binding enforced forcible means 
authority decided ought regarded evil resisted force one time pope another emperor king elective assembly whole nation 
within without state always men found accept binding laws given decrees god made men invested sacred character institutions supposed represent nation men thought good existing authorities regarded bad struggled authorities violence employed 
men invested religious authority regarded evil men institutions invested temporal authority regarded good vice versa struggle grew intense 
longer men used violence means settling disputes obvious became unsuitable means since could external authority able define evil recognized 
things went like eighteen centuries last reached present position absolutely obvious external definition evil binding upon 
men come point ceasing believe possibility even desirability finding establishing general definition 
come men power ceasing attempt prove regard evil evil simply declaring regard evil like subjects longer obey accept definition evil laid simply obey help 
good thing necessary beneficial men contrary course would evil simply power nice incorporated france lorraine germany bohemia austria poland divided ireland india ruled english government chinese attacked africans slaughtered chinese prevented immigrating americans jews persecuted russians landowners appropriate lands cultivate capitalists enjoy fruits labor others 
come present state things one set men commit acts violence longer pretext resistance evil simply profit caprice another set submit violence suppose supposed former times violence practiced upon sake securing evil simply avoid 
roman man mediaeval times average russian fifty years ago remember convinced without shade doubt violence authority indispensable preserve evil taxes dues serfage prisons scourging knouts executions army war ought know one seldom find man believes means violence preserve anyone evil whatever indeed clearly perceive acts violence exposed share great useless evil 
one day see uselessness injustice collecting taxes toiling masses enrich idle officials senselessness inflicting punishments weak depraved persons shape transportation one place another imprisonment fortress living security indolence become weaker depraved worse uselessness injustice positive insanity barbarity preparations war wars causing devastation ruin kind justification 
yet forms violence continue supported people see uselessness injustice cruelty suffer 
fifty years ago idle rich man illiterate laborer alike convinced state everlasting holiday one everlasting toil ordained god know well nowadays thanks growth population diffusion books education would hard find europe even russia either among rich poor man one shape another doubt justice state things never presented 
rich know guilty fact rich try expiate guilt sacrifices art science old expiated sins sacrifices church 
even larger half working people openly declare existing order iniquitous bound destroyed reformed 
one set religious people millions russia called sectaries consider existing social order unjust destroyed ground gospel teaching taken true sense 
others regard unjust ground socialistic communistic anarchistic theories springing lower strata working people 
violence longer rests belief utility fact existed long organized ruling classes profit authority extricate 
governments day despotic liberal alike become herzen well called ghenghis khan telegraph say organizations violence based principle grossest tyranny time taking advantage means invented science peaceful collective social activity free equal men used enslave oppress fellows 
governments ruling classes longer take stand right even semblance justice skillful organization carried point perfection aid science everyone caught circle violence chance escaping 
circle made four methods working upon men joined together like limes chain ring 
first oldest method intimidation 
consists representing existing state organization whatever may free republic savage despotism something sacred immutable therefore following efforts alter cruellest punishments 
method use olden times wherever government russia called nihilists america anarchists france imperialists legitimists communards anarchists 
railways telegraphs telephones photographs great perfection means getting rid men years without killing solitary confinement hidden world perish forgotten many modern inventions employed government give power authority come certain hands police open secret administration prosecutors jailers executioners kinds work zealously chance overturning government however cruel senseless may 
second method corruption 
consists plundering industrious working people wealth means taxes distributing satisfying greed officials bound return support keep oppression people 
bought officials highest ministers poorest copying clerks make unbroken network men bound together interest living expense people 
become richer submissively carry government times places sticking nothing departments support word deed violence government prosperity also rests 
third method describe hypnotizing people 
consists checking moral development men various suggestions keeping back ideal life outgrown mankind large power government rests 
hypnotizing process organized present complex manner starting earliest childhood continues act men till day death 
begins earliest years compulsory schools created purpose children instilled ideas life ancestors direct antagonism conscience modern world 
countries state religion teach children senseless blasphemies church catechisms together duty obedience superiors 
republican states teach savage superstition patriotism pretended obedience governing authorities 
process kept later years encouragement religious patriotic superstitions 
religious superstition encouraged establishing money taken people temples processions memorials festivals aided painting architecture music incense intoxicate people support clergy whose duty consists brutalizing people keeping permanent state stupefaction teaching solemnity services sermons interference private life births deaths marriages 
patriotic superstition encouraged creation money taken people national f tes spectacles monuments festivals dispose men attach importance nation aggrandizement state rulers feel antagonism even hatred nations 
objects despotic governments direct prohibition printing disseminating books enlighten people everyone might rouse people lethargy exiled imprisoned 
moreover every government without exception everything kept back might emancipate everything encouraged tends corrupt people literary works tending keep barbarism religious patriotic superstition kinds sensual amusements spectacles circuses theaters even physical means inducing stupefaction tobacco alcohol form principal source revenue states 
even prostitution encouraged recognized even organized government majority states 
much third method 
fourth method consists selecting men stupefied enslaved three former methods certain number exposing special intensified means stupefaction brutalization making passive instrument carrying cruelties brutalities needed government 
result attained taking youthful age men time form clear definite principles morals removing natural human conditions life home family kindred useful labor 
shut together barracks dressed special clothes worked upon cries drums music shining objects go certain daily actions invented purpose means brought hypnotic condition cease men become mere senseless machines submissive hypnotizer 
physically vigorous young men days universal conscription young men hypnotized armed murderous weapons always obedient governing authorities ready act violence command constitute fourth principal method enslaving men 
method circle violence completed 
intimidation corruption hypnotizing bring people condition willing soldiers soldiers give power punishing plundering purchasing officials spoils hypnotizing converting time soldiers 
circle complete chance breaking force 
persons maintain freedom violence least great diminution may gained oppressed forcibly overturning oppressive government replacing new one violence oppression unnecessary deceive others efforts better position oppressed make worse 
conduct tends increase despotism government 
efforts afford plausible pretext government strengthen power 
even admit combination circumstances specially unfavorable government france government might forcibly overturned power transferred hands new authority would rarely less oppressive old one contrary always defend dispossessed exasperated enemies would despotic cruel always rule revolutions 
socialists communists regard individualistic capitalistic organization society evil anarchists regard evil government whatever royalists conservatives capitalists consider socialistic communistic organization anarchy evil parties means violence bring men agreement 
whichever parties successful bringing schemes pass must resort support authority existing methods violence even invent new ones 
oppressed would another set people coercion would take new form violence oppression would unchanged even cruel since hatred would intensified struggle new forms oppression would devised 
always revolutions attempts revolution conspiracies violent changes government 
every conflict strengthens means oppression hands happen given moment power 
position christian society especially ideals current prove strikingly convincing way 
remains one sphere human life encroached upon government authority domestic economic sphere sphere private life labor 
even thanks efforts communists socialists gradually encroached upon government labor recreation dwellings dress food gradually hopes reformers successful prescribed regulated government 
slow progress eighteen centuries brought christian nations necessity deciding question evaded question acceptance non acceptance christ teaching question following upon social life resistance non resistance evil force 
difference whereas formerly men could accept refuse accept solution given christ solution avoided since alone save men slavery caught like net 
misery position makes inevitable 
pagan organization proved false truth christian religion growing evident 
vain best men christian humanity apprehended truth spiritual intuition eighteen centuries testified spite every menace every privation every suffering 
martyrdom passed truth masses impressed hearts 
christianity penetrated consciousness humanity negatively demonstration impossibility continuing pagan life also simplification increased clearness freedom superstitions intermingled diffusion classes population 
eighteen centuries christianity passed without effect even accepted externally 
eighteen centuries brought men far even continue live pagan life longer consistent development humanity see clearly wretchedness position depths souls believe live belief salvation position found fulfilling christian doctrine true significance 
time manner salvation opinions divided according intellectual development prejudices society 
every man modern world recognizes salvation lies fulfilling law christ 
believers supernatural character christianity hold salvation come men brought believe christ whose second coming hand 
believers supernatural christianity hold salvation come church draw men fold train christian virtues transform life 
third section admit divinity christ hold salvation mankind brought slow gradual progress pagan principles existence replaced principles liberty equality fraternity christian principles 
fourth section believe social revolution hold salvation come violent revolution men forced community property abolition government collective instead individual industry say realization one side christian doctrine 
one way another men day inner consciousness condemn existing effete pagan order admit often unconsciously regarding hostile christianity salvation found application christian doctrine parts true significance daily life 
christianity founder said realized majority men must grow like huge tree tiny seed 
grown reached full development yet actual life conscience men day 
minority always comprehended christianity spiritual intuition vast majority seem far social existence recognize true significance 
look individual men private life listen standards conduct judgment one another hear public utterances counsels given parents guardians young charge see far social life based violence may realizing christian truth private life considered good without exception nothing christian virtues considered bad nothing antichristian vices 
consecrate lives self sacrificingly service humanity regarded best men 
selfish make use misfortunes others advantage regarded worst men 
though non christian ideals strength courage wealth still worshiped penetrated christian spirit ideals date abandoned least regarded best people 
ideals christian ideals accepted regarded binding 
position christian humanity look outside cruelty degradation men terrible indeed 
one looks within inner consciousness spectacle presents absolutely different 
evil life seems exist long evil time yet learn act otherwise though want act 
evil seems exist cause independent conscience men 
strange contradictory seems men present day hate social order supporting 
think max ller describes amazement indian convert christianity absorbing essence christian doctrine came europe saw actual life christians 
could recover astonishment complete contrast reality expected find among christian nations 
feel astonishment contrast convictions conduct influences tending obscure contrast produce effect upon us 
need look life point view indian understood christianity true significance without compromises concessions need look savage brutalities life full appalled contradictions midst live often without observing 
need recall preparations war mitrailleuses silver gilt bullets torpedoes red cross solitary prison cells experiments execution electricity care hygienic welfare prisoners philanthropy rich life produces poor benefiting 
inconsistencies might seem men pretend christians really pagans something lacking men kind force hindering already feel consciousness genuinely wish 
men present day merely pretend hate oppression inequality class distinction every kind cruelty animals well human beings 
genuinely detest know put stop perhaps decide give preserves seems necessary 
indeed ask every man separately whether thinks laudable worthy man age hold position receives salary disproportionate work take people often poverty taxes spent constructing cannon torpedoes instruments butchery make war people wish peace feel wish regard us receive salary devoting one whole life constructing instruments butchery preparing oneself others work murder 
ask whether laudable worthy man suitable christian employ salary seizing wretched misguided often illiterate drunken creatures appropriate property others much smaller scale kill men different fashion undertake shutting prison ill treating killing whether laudable worthy man christian preach salary people christianity superstitions one knows stupid pernicious whether laudable worthy man rob neighbor gratification wants satisfy simplest needs great landowners force exhausting labor beyond strength augment one wealth factory owners manufacturers profit poverty men increase one gains merchants 
everyone taken separately especially one remarks directed someone else answer yet man sees baseness actions free uncoerced anyone often even pecuniary profit childish vanity china cross scrap ribbon bit fringe allowed wear enter military service become magistrate justice peace commissioner archbishop beadle though fulfilling offices must commit acts baseness shamefulness fail recognize 
know many men confidently try prove reasons regarding position legitimate quite indispensable 
say defense authority given god functions state indispensable welfare humanity property opposed christianity rich young man commanded sell give poor wished perfect existing distribution property commercial system must always remain advantage 
however much try deceive others know opposed beliefs profess depths souls left alone conscience ashamed miserable recollection especially baseness action pointed

seems way position 
would none except man thereby men gifted power forming different higher theory life frees bonds seems indissolubly fettered 
theory christian view life made known mankind eighteen hundred years ago 
man need make theory life fetters seemed indissolubly forged upon drop feel absolutely free bird would feel free fenced place directly tools wings 
people talk liberty christian church giving giving freedom christians 
underlying ideas expressions strange misconception 
freedom bestowed taken christian christians 
freedom inalienable possession christian 
talk bestowing freedom christians withholding obviously talking real christians people call christians 
christian fail free attainment aim sets prevented even hindered anyone anything 
let man understand life christianity teaches understand let understand life belongs individuality family state sent world let understand must therefore fulfill law individuality family state infinite law come feel absolutely free every human power even cease regard power able hamper anyone 
let man realize aim life fulfillment god law law replace laws give sole allegiance allegiance every human law lose binding controlling power eyes 
christian independent every human authority fact regards divine law love implanted soul every man brought consciousness christ sole guide life men also 
christian may subjected external violence may deprived bodily freedom may bondage passions commits sin slave sin bondage sense forced danger threat external harm perform act conscience 
compelled deprivations sufferings form powerful weapon men state conception life least power compel 
deprivations sufferings take happiness live far disturbing happiness christian consists consciousness fulfilling god may even intensify inflicted fulfilling 
therefore christian subject inner divine law carry enactments external law agreement divine law love acknowledges usually case state obligations even recognize duty obedience anyone anything whatever recognize duty called allegiance 
christian oath allegiance government whatever act regarded foundation existence state direct renunciation christianity 
man promises unconditional obedience future laws made made promise positive manner renouncing christianity means obeying every circumstance life divine law love recognizes within 
pagan conception life possible carry temporal authorities without infringing law god expressed circumcisions sabbaths fixed times prayer abstention certain kinds food 
one law opposed 
distinction christian religion heathen religion 
christianity require man certain definite negative acts puts new different relation men may result diverse acts defined beforehand 
therefore christian promise obey man without knowing required obey changing laws even promise anything definite certain time abstain anything certain time

christian promising unconditional fulfillment laws men future would show plainly promise inner law god constitute sole law life 
christian promise obedience men laws men though workman bound one employer also promise carry every order might given outsiders

christian independent human authority acknowledges god authority alone

independence gained means strife destruction existing forms life change interpretation life 
independence results first christian recognizing law love revealed teacher perfectly sufficient human relations therefore regards every use force unnecessary unlawful secondly fact deprivations sufferings threats deprivations sufferings reduce man social conception life necessity obeying christian different conception life present merely inevitable conditions existence

christian dispute anyone attack anyone use violence anyone 
contrary bear violence without opposing 
attitude violence free free whole world external power 
ye shall know truth truth shall make free 
doubt christianity truth perfect liberty nothing curtail man experiences directly makes christian theory life would unmistakable proof truth 
men present condition like swarm bees hanging cluster branch 
position bees branch temporary must inevitably changed 
must start find habitation 
bees knows desires change others position one till rest 
start one hangs another hinders separating swarm therefore continue hang 
would seem bees could never escape position seems worldly men caught toils state conception life never escape 
would escape bees living separate creature endowed wings 
similarly would escape men living endowed faculty entering christian conception life 
every bee could fly try fly others would never stirred swarm would never change position 
man mastered christian conception life would without waiting people begin live accordance conception mankind would never change position 
let one bee spread wings start fly away another another clinging inert cluster would become freely flying swarm bees 
way let one man look life christianity teaches look let another another enchanted circle existence state conception life seemed escape broken 
men think set men free means slow process must find means could set men free 
though bees want start fly away consider long process wait swarm start one one think ought find means would necessary every separate bee spread wings fly whole swarm could fly wanted 
possible till first second third hundredth bee spreads wings flies accord swarm fly begin new life 
till every individual man makes christian conception life begins live accord solution problem human life establishment new form life 
one striking phenomena times precisely advocacy slavery promulgated among masses governments inevitable men advocating socialistic theories regard champions freedom 
people advance opinion amelioration life bringing facts life harmony conscience come result personal efforts individual men result certain possible reconstruction society effected way 
idea promulgated men ought walk legs want ought go kind floor feet moved somehow reach ought go without moving legs 
therefore efforts ought directed going far strength allows direction ought go standing still constructing floor 
sphere political economy theory propounded amounts saying worse things better greater accumulation capital therefore oppression workman nearer day emancipation therefore every personal effort part man free oppression capital useless 
sphere government maintained greater power government according theory ought intervene every department private life yet intervened better therefore ought invoke interference government private life 
politics international questions maintained improvement means destruction multiplication armaments lead necessity making war means congresses arbitration 
marvelous say great dullness men believe theories spite fact whole course life every step take shows unworthy belief 
people suffering oppression deliver oppression advised frame general measures improvement position measures intrusted authorities continue yield obedience authorities 
obviously results greater power hands authorities greater oppression resulting 
one errors men carries far away aim toward struggling one 
kinds different things attainment aim one simple obvious thing within reach everyone 
devise subtlest means changing position irksome simplest means everyone refrain leads position 
told story gallant police officer came village peasants insurrection military called undertook pacify insurrection spirit nicholas personal influence alone 
ordered loads rods brought collecting peasants together barn went locking door 
begin terrified peasants loud threats reduced submission set work flog one another command 
flogged one another simpleton found would allow flogged shouted companions flog one another 
fogging ceased police officer made escape 
well simpleton advice would never followed men state conception life continue flog one another teach people act self castigation last word human wisdom 
indeed one imagine striking instance men flogging submissiveness men times perform duties required keep slavery especially duty military service see people enslaving suffering slavery believing must matter hinder emancipation men prepared somewhere somehow spite ever increasing growth slavery 
fact take man present time whatever mean true christian average man present day educated uneducated believing unbelieving rich poor married unmarried 
man lives working work enjoying amusements spending fruits labors near like everyone hating every kind restriction deprivation dissension suffering 
man going way peaceably suddenly people come say first promise swear us slavishly obey us everything dictate consider absolutely good authoritative everything plan decide call law 
secondly hand part fruits labors us dispose use money keep slavery hinder forcibly opposing orders 
thirdly elect others elected take pretended share government knowing government proceed quite without regard foolish speeches like may utter knowing proceedings according army hands 
fourthly come certain time law courts take share senseless cruelties perpetrate sinners corrupted shape penal servitude exile solitary confinement death 
fifthly lastly spite fact maybe friendliest terms people nations ready directly order regard indicate enemies ready assist either person proxy devastation plunder murder men women children aged alike possibly kinsmen relations necessary us 
one would expect every man present day grain sense left might reply requirements one would think every right minded man must say amazement promise yield obedience everything decreed first salisbury gladstone one day boulanger another parliament one day peter iii next catherine day pougachef one day mad king bavaria another william promise obey knowing wicked foolish people else knowing hand fruits labors shape taxes knowing money spent support officials prisons churches armies things harmful enslavement punish go wasting time hoodwinking giving miscreant evildoers semblance legality taking part elections pretending taking part government know well real control government hands got hold army go law courts take part trial punishment men sinned knowing christian law vengeance replaced law love educated man punishments reform deprave inflicted consider enemies people neighboring nation hitherto lived wish live love harmony kill rob bring misery simply order keys temple jerusalem may hands one archbishop another one german another may prince bulgaria english rather american merchants may capture seals take part person hire others murder brothers kinsmen flog altogether unnecessary hurtful every point view immoral base vile 
tell shall receive injury someone first place anticipate anyone injury great injury bring obey secondly perfectly clear selves flog one flog us 
government means tzars ministers officials pens hands force us anything officer police compelled peasants men drag us law court prison execution tzars officials pens hands people position 
unprofitable harmful unpleasant flogged therefore every likelihood open eyes would treat violence would 
thirdly even come pass suffer even would better exiled sent prison standing common sense right day least within short time must triumphant suffer folly wrong must come end directly 
therefore even case better run risk banishing shutting prison executing living life bondage fault wicked men 
better possibility destroyed victorious enemies stupidly tortured killed fighting cannon piece land use anyone senseless rag called banner 
want flog 
reason 
want done 
one would thought religious moral feeling alone simplest common sense foresight impel every man present day answer act way 

men state conception life opinion act way necessary even prejudicial attainment object emancipation men slavery 
hold must continue like police officer peasants flog one another consoling reflection talking away assemblies meetings founding trades unions marching streets st may getting conspiracies stealthily teasing government flogging us brought pass enslaving closer closer bondage shall soon free 
nothing hinders emancipation men slavery much amazing error 
instead every man directing energies freeing transforming conception life people seek external united method gaining freedom continue rivet chains faster faster 
much men maintain make fire need kindle coals necessary arrange coals certain order 
yet fact freedom men brought freedom individual persons becomes clear time goes 
freedom individual men name christian conception life state domination formerly exceptional unnoticed phenomenon late acquired threatening significance state authorities 
former age roman times happened christian confessed religion refused take part sacrifices worship emperors gods middle ages christian refused worship images acknowledge authority pope cases first place matter chance 
man might placed necessity confessing faith might live life without placed necessity 
men without exception subjected trial faith 
every man present day necessity taking part cruelties pagan life refusing participation 
secondly days cases refusal worship gods images pope incidents material bearing state 
whether men worshiped worship gods images pope state remained powerful 
cases refusing comply unchristian demands government striking root state authority whole authority state based compliance unchristian demands 
sovereign powers world course time brought position preservation must require men actions performed men profess true christianity 
therefore days every profession true christianity individual man strikes essential power state inevitably leads way emancipation

young man fair education refuses moscow townhall take oath

attention paid arguments requested comply order comply 
supposed sectary therefore understand christianity right sense say sense priests pay government understand 
young man conducted escort priests may bring reason 
priests begin reason efforts christ name persuade renounce christ obviously influence pronounced incorrigible sent back army 
persists taking oath openly refuses perform military duties 
case provided laws 
overlook refusal comply demands authorities question put case par simple breach discipline also question 
deliberation among military authorities decide get rid troublesome young man consider revolutionist dispatch escort committee secret police 
police authorities gendarmes cross question nothing says brought head misdemeanors come jurisdiction 
possibility accusing either revolutionary acts revolutionary plotting since declares wish attack anything contrary opposed use force far plotting secret seeks every opportunity saying says open manner 
gendarmes though bound hard fast rules still find ground criminal charge young man like clergy send back army 
authorities deliberate together decide accept though taken oath enrol among soldiers 
put uniform enrol send guard place army quartered 
chief officer division enters expects young man perform military duties refuses obey presence soldiers explains reason refusal saying christian voluntarily prepare commit murder forbidden law moses 
incident occurs provincial town 
case awakens interest even sympathy outsiders even officers 
chief officers consequently decide punish refusal obedience disciplinary measures 
save appearances though shut young man prison write highest military authorities inquire 
refuse serve army tzar serves enjoys blessing church seems insanity official point view 
consequently write petersburg since young man must mind must use severe treatment must send lunatic asylum mental condition may inquired scientifically treated 
send asylum hope remain like another young man refused ten years ago tver serve army tortured asylum till submitted 
even step rid military authorities inconvenient man 
doctors examine interest warmly case naturally finding symptoms mental disease send back army 
receive making believe forgotten refusal motives request go drill presence soldiers refuses explains reason refusal 
affair continues attract attention among soldiers inhabitants town 
write petersburg thence comes decree transfer young man division army stationed frontier place army martial law shot refusing obey matter proceed without attracting observation seeing russians christians distant part majority foreigners mohammedans 
accordingly done 
transfer division stationed zacaspian border company convicts send chief officer notorious harshness severity 
time changes place place young man roughly treated kept cold hunger filth life made burdensome generally 
sufferings compel change resolution 
zacaspian border requested go guard fully armed declines obey 
refuse go stand near haystacks place refuses take arms declaring use violence case anyone

men various parts russia behave though agreement precisely way young man cases government adopted timorous undecided secretive course action 
men sent lunatic asylum enrolled clerks transferred siberia sent work forests sent prison fined

thus officer reserve report change residence justified ground would serve army longer fined thirty rubles non compliance orders superior authority 
fine also declined voluntarily pay 
way peasants soldiers refused drilled bear arms placed arrest charge breach discipline insolence 
cases refusing comply demands government opposed christianity especially cases refusing serve army occurring late russia everywhere 
thus happen know servia men called sect nazarenes steadily refuse serve army austrian government carrying fruitless contest years punishing imprisonment 
year cases 
know switzerland year men prison castle chillon declining serve army whose resolution shaken punishment 
cases sweden men refused obedience sent prison exactly way government studiously concealed cases people 
similar cases also prussia 
know case sub lieutenant guards declared authorities berlin would christian continue serve spite admonitions threats punishments stuck resolution 
south france society arisen late bearing name hinschists facts taken peace herald july members refuse enter military service grounds christian principles 
first enrolled ambulance corps numbers increase subjected punishment non compliance still refuse bear arms 
socialists communists anarchists bombs riots revolutions nearly much dreaded governments disconnected individuals coming different parts justifying non compliance grounds religion known world 
every government knows means manner defend revolutionists resources therefore dread external foes 
governments men show uselessness superfluousness perniciousness governments contend simply need without therefore unwilling take part revolutionists say form government bad respect respect must overturn substitute form government 
christian says know nothing form government know whether good bad want overturn precisely know whether good bad reason want support either 
want demands conscience 
state obligations conscience christian oath allegiance taxes law proceedings military service 
whole power government rests obligations 
revolutionary enemies attack government without 
christianity attack within destroys foundations government rests 
among russian people especially since age peter protest christianity government never ceased social organization men emigrate communes turkey china uninhabited lands feel need state aid always regard state useless burden endured misfortune whether happens turkish russian chinese 
among russian people frequent examples late appeared conscious christian freedom subjection state 
examples alarming government fact non compliant persons often belong called lower uneducated classes men fair good education also fact days justify position mystic exceptional views former times associate superstitious fanatic rites like sects practice self immolation fire wandering pilgrims put refusal simplest clearest grounds comprehensible recognized true 
thus refuse voluntary payment taxes taxes spent deeds violence pay men violence soldiers construction prisons fortresses cannons 
christians regard sinful immoral hand deeds 
refuse take oath allegiance refuse promise obedience authorities men given deeds violence contrary sense christ teaching 
refuse take oath law courts oaths directly forbidden gospel 
refuse perform police duties performance duties must use force brothers ill treat christian 
refuse take part trials law consider every appeal law fulfilling law vengeance inconsistent christian law forgiveness love 
refuse take part military preparations army executioners unwilling prepare 
motives cases excellent however despotic governments may could hardly punish openly 
punish men refusing act conscience government must renounce claim good sense benevolence 
assure people rule name good sense benevolence 
governments people governments course flog death execute keep perpetual imprisonment enemies want overturn violence lavish gold section people ready destroy enemies 
men without wishing overturn destroy anything desire simply part nothing law christ therefore refuse perform commonest state requirements therefore indispensable maintenance state revolutionists advocating practicing violence murder suppression would easy matter could bought could duped could overawed could bought duped overawed would treated criminals enemies society would executed imprisoned crowd would approved action government 
fanatics professing peculiar belief might possible disproving superstitious errors mixed religion attack also truth advocate 
done men profess revolutionary ideas peculiar religious dogmas merely unwilling evil man refuse take oath pay taxes take part law proceedings serve army fulfill fact obligations upon whole fabric state rests done people buy bribes impossible risks voluntarily expose show incorruptible 
dupe believing duty god also impossible since refusal based clear unmistakable law god recognized even trying compel men act 
terrify threats still less possible deprivations sufferings subjected strengthen desire follow faith commanded obey god rather men fear destroy body fear destroy body soul 
kill keep perpetual imprisonment also impossible 
men friends past way thinking acting well known known everyone good gentle peaceable people regarded criminals must removed safety society 
put men death regarded good men provoke others champion justify refusal 
necessary explain reasons refusal make clear everyone reasons force men ought done long ago 
cases put ruling powers desperate position 
see prophecy christianity coming pass loosening fetters chains setting free bondage must inevitably end oppressors 
ruling authorities see know hours numbered nothing 
save deferring hour downfall 
position none less desperate 
like position conqueror trying save town set fire inhabitants 
directly puts conflagration one place alight two places directly gives fire cuts fire large building building alight ends 
separate fires may burning flame however small spark starts never ceases till set whole ablaze 
thus ruling authorities defenseless position men advocate christianity little necessary overthrow sovereign power seems powerful held exalted position many centuries 
yet social reformers busy promulgating idea necessary even pernicious immoral every man separately work freedom 
though one set men work long turning river new channel dug complete water course open floodgates water rush rest another set men come along begin advise would much better instead letting water construct machine would ladle water one side pour side 
thing gone far 
already ruling governments feel weak defenseless position men christian principles awakening apathy already begin feel power 
come send fire earth said christ already kindled fire beginning burn

christianity true sense puts end government 
understood commencement cause christ crucified 
always understood people necessity justifying christian government 
time heads government assumed external nominal christianity men began invent impossible cunningly devised theories means christianity reconciled government 
honest serious minded man day help seeing incompatibility true christianity doctrine meekness forgiveness injuries love government pomp acts violence executions wars 
profession true christianity excludes possibility recognizing government even destroys foundations 
right saying christianity incompatible government question naturally presents necessary good humanity way men happiness best secured maintaining organization government destroying replacing christianity people maintain government necessary humanity destruction state organization would involve destruction humanity gained state still form humanity develop 
evil see among peoples living government organization attribute type society abuses say corrected without destroying thus humanity without discarding state organization develop attain high degree happiness 
men way thinking bring forward support views arguments think irrefutable drawn history philosophy even religion 
men hold contrary time humanity lived without government organization temporary time must come men need new organization time come 
men way thinking also bring forward support views arguments think irrefutable philosophy history religion 
volumes may written defense former view volumes indeed long ago written still written side much also written much also brilliantly written though recently side 
proved champions state maintain destruction government involves social chaos mutual spoliation murder destruction social institutions return mankind barbarism 
proved opponents government maintain men already become wise good spoil murder one another prefer peaceful associations hostilities accord unaided state make arrangements need therefore government far aid show guarding men exerts pernicious brutalizing influence 
impossible prove either contentions abstract reasoning 
still less possible prove experiment since whole matter turns question ought try experiment question whether time come make end government would unanswerable except exists another living means settling beyond dispute 
may dispute upon question whether nestlings ready without mother hen come eggs whether yet advanced enough 
young birds decide question without regard arguments find cramped space eggs 
begin try beaks come accord 
question whether time come away governmental type society replace new type 
man growth higher conscience longer comply demands government finds cramped time longer needs protection 
comes pass question whether men ready discard governmental type solved 
conclusion final young birds hatched eggs 
power world put back shells power world bring men governmental type society outgrown 
may well government necessary still necessary advantages attribute says man mastered christian theory life 
know one hand government longer necessary hand longer carry measures necessary existence government 
settle need life 
prove need harm governments general 
know need need 
know need divide nations therefore admit belong exclusively state nation owe allegiance government 
know need government institutions organized within state therefore deprive people need labor give form taxes institutions need know may pernicious 
know need administration courts justice founded upon force therefore take part either 
know need attack slaughter nations defend arms therefore take part wars preparations wars 
may well people help regarding necessary indispensable 
dispute question speak say absolute certainty need 
need personal sent life gave indubitable law conduct life 
whatever arguments may advanced support contention suppression government authority would injurious would lead great calamities men outgrown governmental form society go back 
reasoning world make man outgrown governmental form society take part actions disallowed conscience full grown bird made return egg shell 
even say champions existing order things still suppression government violence possible desirable men become christians 
long among people nominally christians unchristian wicked men gratification lusts ready harm others suppression government authority far blessing others would increase miseries 
suppression governmental type society undesirable long minority true christians would even desirable whole nation christians among around still unchristian men nations 
unchristian men would rob outrage kill christians impunity would make lives miserable 
would result would bad would oppress outrage good impunity 
therefore authority government must suppressed till wicked rapacious people world extinct 
since either never least long time come spite efforts individual christians independent government authority ought maintained interests majority 
champions government assert without wicked oppress outrage good power government enables good resist wicked 
assertion champions existing order things take granted proposition want prove 
say except government bad would oppress good take granted good present time possession power bad subjection 
wants proving 
would true custom society rather supposed custom china good always rule directly head government cease better rule citizens bound remove 
supposed custom china 
reality never 
remove heads government ruling force right alone power needed 
even china imaginary custom 
christian world even suppose custom nothing build supposition good superior power reality seized power keep retainers benefit 
good seize power retain men must love power 
love power inconsistent goodness quite consistent opposite qualities pride cunning cruelty 
without aggrandizement self abasement others without hypocrisies deceptions without prisons fortresses executions murders power come existence maintained 
power government suppressed wicked oppress less wicked say champions state authority 
egyptians conquered jews romans conquered greeks barbarians conquered romans possible conquerors always better conquered transitions power within state one personage another power always passed worse person better one louis xvi 
removed robespierre came power afterward napoleon ruled better man worse better men power versaillist party commune power charles ruler cromwell peter iii 
tzar killed catherine tzaritsa one half russia pougachef ruled bad good men happen authority assert authority necessary keep bad oppressing good assuming good par excellence protect good people bad 
ruling means using force using force means force used like uses force would certainly like done 
consequently ruling means others would would unto us wrong 
submit means prefer suffering using force 
prefer suffering using force means good least less wicked unto others would like 
therefore probability better worse always ruled ruling 
may bad men among ruled better generally ruled worse 
might possible suppose inexact heathen definition good clear christian definition good evil impossible imagine 
less good less bad distinguished heathen world christian conception good evil clearly defined characteristics good wicked impossible confound 
according christ teaching good meek long suffering resist evil force forgive injuries love enemies wicked exalt oppress strive use force 
therefore christ teaching doubt whether good found among rulers ruled whether wicked among ruled rulers 
indeed absurd even speak christians ruling 
non christians find aim lives earthly happiness must always rule christians aim whose lives renunciation earthly happiness 
difference always existed become defined christian religion widely diffused correctly understood 
widely true christianity diffused penetrated men conscience impossible christians rulers easier became non christians rule 
get rid governmental violence society true christians result wicked dominating good oppressing impunity say champions existing order things 
never otherwise 
always beginning world still 
wicked always dominate good always oppress

asserting accuse say power e violence needed defend men possible oppressors present future see footnote 
footnote may quote connection amazingly naive comic declaration russian authorities oppressors nationalities poles germans baltic provinces jews 
russian government oppressed subjects centuries never troubled little russians poland letts baltic provinces russian peasants exploited everyone 
sudden become champion oppressed oppressed oppressing 
weakness use violence lies fact arguments brought forward oppressors defense even better reason advanced 
plead danger violence often imagined future continuing practice actual violence 
say men used pillage murder past afraid pillage murder one another power 
may happen may happen 
fact ruin thousands men prisons fortresses galleys exile break millions families ruin millions men physically well morally army fact imaginary real act violence according argument one ought oppose violence 
wicked men according argument absolutely necessary use violence oppressed sure say oppressors 
non christian men always say think act reasoning 
oppressed wicked oppressors attack try overthrow favorable circumstances succeed overthrowing common rise ranks oppressors assist acts violence 
violence champions government hold terror pretending except oppressive power wicked would oppress good really always existed exist human society 
therefore suppression state violence case cause increased oppression good wicked 
state violence ceased would acts violence perhaps part different people done deeds violence 
total amount violence could case increased mere fact power passing one set men another 
state violence cease wicked men society say champions existing order things assuming course since always wicked men never cease 
would right enough case assume oppressors always best men sole means saving men evil violence 
indeed violence could never cease 
since case quite contrary better oppress worse worse oppress better since violence never put end evil moreover another means putting end assertion violence never cease incorrect 
use violence grows less less evidently must disappear 
come pass champions existing order imagine oppressed becoming better better influence government contrary influence causes continual degradation fact men constantly growing better better even wicked power become less less wicked till last good incapable using violence 
progressive movement humanity proceed better elements society seizing power making subject better forcible means conservatives revolutionists imagine 
proceeds first principally fact men general advancing steadily undeviatingly toward conscious assimilation christian theory life secondly fact even apart conscious spiritual life men unconsciously brought christian attitude life process one set men grasping power replaced others 
worse elements society gaining possession power sobering influence always accompanies power grow less less cruel become incapable using cruel forms violence 
consequently others able seize place process softening say unconscious christianizing goes 
something like process ebullition 
majority men non christian view life always strive power struggle obtain 
struggle cruel coarsest least christian elements society overpower gentle well disposed christian rise means violence upper ranks society 
christ prophecy fulfilled woe rich woe unto full woe unto men shall speak well men possession power results glory wealth attained various aims set recognize vanity return position came 
charles v john iv alexander recognizing emptiness evil power renounced incapable using violence benefit done 
solitary examples recognition emptiness evil power 
everyone gains position power striven every general every minister every millionaire every petty official gained place coveted ten years every rich peasant laid hundred rubles passes unconscious process softening 
individual men societies men whole nations pass process 
seductions power wealth honor luxury gives seem sufficient aim men efforts long unattained 
directly man reaches sees vanity gradually lose power attraction 
like clouds form beauty distance directly one ascends splendor vanishes 
men possession power wealth sometimes even gained power wealth often heirs cease eager power cruel efforts obtain 
learned experience operation christian influence vanity gained violence men sometimes one sometimes several generations lose vices generated passion power wealth 
become less cruel maintain position expelled power others less christian wicked 
thus return rank society lower position higher morality raising thereby average level christian consciousness men 
directly worst coarsest least christian elements society rise top subjected process predecessors generation seeing vanity gained violence imbibed christianity come among oppressed place filled new oppressors less brutal former oppressors though oppress 
although power remains externally every change men power constant increase number men brought experience necessity assimilating christian conception life every change though coarsest crudest least christian come possession power less coarse cruel christian predecessors gained possession power 
power selects attracts worst elements society transforms improves softens returns society 
process means christianity spite hindrances human progress resulting violence power gains hold men 
christianity penetrates consciousness men spite violence power also means 
therefore assertion champions state power government suppressed wicked would oppress good fails show dreaded since happens proves contrary governmental power enables wicked oppress good evil desirable suppress gradually suppressed natural course things 
true governmental power disappear power become christian renounce power accord men found willing take place even process already going say champions existing order come pass eighteen hundred years still many eager power anxious obey seems likelihood happening soon indeed ever happening 
even always men prefer renouncing power enjoying mass men reserve prefer dominion subjection great difficult imagine time number exhausted 
christianizing process could affect men one another would pass heathen christian conception life would voluntarily abandon power wealth would necessary coarse half savage men completely incapable appreciating christianity acting upon always great many every christian society converted christianity 
savage absolutely non christian peoples numerous outside christian world must also converted 
therefore even admit christianizing process day affect everyone still judging amount progress made eighteen hundred years many times eighteen centuries 
therefore impossible unprofitable think present anything impracticable suppression authority 
ought try put authority best hands 
criticism would perfectly transition one conception life another accomplished single process men separately successively realizing emptiness power reaching christian truth inner spiritual path 
process goes unceasingly men passing christianity one another inner way 
also another external means men reach christianity transition less gradual 
transition one organization life another accomplished degrees like sand running hourglass grain grain 
like water filling vessel floating water 
first water runs slowly one side vessel grows heavier suddenly begins sink almost instantaneously fills water 
transitions mankind one conception one organization life another 
first gradually slowly one another men attain new truth inner spiritual way follow life 
certain point diffusion truth reached suddenly assimilated everyone inner way involuntarily 
champions existing order wrong arguing since small section mankind passed christianity eighteen centuries must many times eighteen centuries remainder 
argument take account means besides inward spiritual one men assimilate new truth pass one order life another 
men assimilate truth recognizing prophetic insight experience life 
truth become sufficiently widely diffused men lower stage development accept simply confidence reached inner spiritual way applying life 
every new truth order human life changed humanity advanced first accepted small number men understand inner spiritual intuition 
remainder mankind accepted trust preceding truth existing order based always opposed diffusion new truth 
seeing begin men stand still steadily advancing greater recognition truth closer adaptation life secondly men varying degrees according age education race capable understanding new truths first nearest men attained new truth spiritual intuition slowly one one afterward quickly pass new truth 
thus number men accept new truth becomes greater greater truth becomes comprehensible 
thus confidence aroused remainder less advanced stage capacity understanding truth 
becomes easier grasp increasing number accept 
movement goes quickly ever increasing scale like snowball till last public opinion harmony new truth created whole mass men carried momentum new truth establishes new social order accordance 
men accept new truth gained certain degree acceptance always pass masses 
like ballast every ship always loaded keep upright enable sail properly 
ballast ship would low enough water would shift position slightest change conditions 
ballast strikes one first superfluous even hindering progress vessel really indispensable good navigation 
mass mankind individually always mass influence new social idea pass one organization life another 
mass always hinders inertia frequent rapid revolutions social order sufficiently proved human experience 
delays every truth long till stood test prolonged struggles thoroughly permeated consciousness humanity 
mistake say small minority men assimilated christianity eighteen centuries must take many times many centuries mankind assimilate since time far live present need even think 
mistake men lower stage culture men nations represented obstacle realization christian order life people always pass masses truth recognized public opinion 
therefore transformation human life men power renounce none anxious take place come men consciously separately assimilating christian conception life 
come christian public opinion arisen definite easily comprehensible reach whole inert mass able attain truth intuition therefore always sway public opinion 
public opinion arises spontaneously spreads hundreds thousands years power working men infection great rapidity gains hold great numbers men 
say champions existing order even true public opinion attained certain degree definiteness precision convert inert mass men outside christian world non christian races well coarse depraved living midst proofs christian public opinion arisen able replace force render unnecessary 
must give force existing order maintained relying vague impalpable influence public opinion expose christians risk pillaged murdered outraged every way savages inside outside civilized society 
since even supported use force hardly control non christian elements always ready pour us destroy gained civilization likely public opinion could take place force render us secure besides find moment public opinion become strong enough able replace use force reject use force trust public opinion defend us would insane remove weapons defense menagerie let loose lions tigers relying fact animals seemed peaceable kept cages held check red hot irons 
therefore people power put positions authority fate god right run risk ruining gained civilization want try experiment see whether public opinion able replace protection given authority 
french writer forgotten alphonse karr said somewhere trying show impossibility away death penalty que messieurs les assassins commencent par nous donner l exemple 
often heard bon mot repeated men thought words witty convincing argument abolition capital punishment 
yet erroneousness argument consider governments give use force till people capable could clearly expressed epigram 
let murderers say champions state violence set us example giving murder give 
murderers say much right 
say let undertaken teach us guide us set us example giving legal murder imitate 
say jest seriously actual state case 
give use violence surrounded violent ruffians 
nothing days hinders progress humanity establishment organization corresponding present development false reasoning 
authority convinced men guided progress use force therefore confidently make use support existing organization 
existing order maintained force public opinion action disturbed use force 
effect using force disturb weaken thing tries maintain 
violence even favorable case used simply personal aims power always punishes one inelastic formula law long condemned public opinion 
difference public opinion censures condemns acts opposed moral law including varied cases reprobation law rests violence condemns punishes certain limited range acts seems justify acts kind come scope 
public opinion ever since time moses regarded covetousness profligacy cruelty wrong censured accordingly 
condemns every kind manifestation covetousness appropriation property others force fraud trickery even cruel abuse wealth condemns every form profligacy whether concubine slave divorced woman even one wife condemns every kind cruelty whether shown blows ill treatment murder men even animals 
law resting force punishes certain forms covetousness robbery swindling certain forms profligacy cruelty conjugal infidelity murder wounding 
way seems countenance manifestations covetousness profligacy cruelty come narrow definition 
besides corrupting public opinion use force leads men fatal conviction progress spiritual impulse impels attainment truth realization life constitutes source every progressive movement humanity means violence force far leading men truth always carries away 
fatal error leads men neglect chief force underlying life spiritual activity turn attention energy use violence superficial sluggish generally pernicious action 
make mistake men trying set steam engine motion turn wheels round hands suspecting underlying cause movement expansion steam motion wheels 
turning wheels hand levers could produce semblance movement meantime would wrenching wheels preventing fit real movement 
people think make men advance means external force 
say christian life established without use violence savage races outside pale christian societies africa asia even represent chinese danger civilization midst christian societies savage corrupt according new theory heredity congenital criminals 
violence say necessary keep savages criminals annihilating civilization 
savages within without christian society terror us never subjugated violence subjugated 
nations never subjugated nations violence alone 
nation subjugated another lower level civilization never happened succeeded introducing organization life violence 
contrary always forced adopt organization life existing conquered nation 
ever nations conquered force really subjugated even nearly always action public opinion never violence tends drive people rebellion 
whole nations subjugated new religion become christian mohammedan conversion never brought authorities made obligatory contrary violence much oftener acted opposite direction public opinion made change inevitable 
nations contrary driven force accept faith conquerors always remained antagonistic 
savage elements existing midst civilized societies 
neither increased diminished severity punishment modifications prisons increase police increase diminish number criminals 
number diminished change moral standard society 
severities could put end duels vendettas certain districts 
spite number tcherkesses executed robbery continue robbers youth maiden marry tcherkess youth till given proof bravery carrying horse least sheep 
men cease fight duels tcherkesses cease robbers fear punishment indeed invests crime additional charm youth change moral standard public opinion 
crimes 
force never suppress sanctioned public opinion 
contrary public opinion need direct opposition force neutralize whole effect use force 
always always every case martyrdom 
would happen force used hostile nations criminal elements society know 
know prolonged experience neither enemies criminals successfully suppressed force 
indeed could nations subjugated violence led whole education traditions even religion see loftiest virtue warring oppressors fighting freedom suppress force acts committed midst society regarded crimes government daring exploits people exterminate nations criminals violence possible indeed done subdue impossible 
sole guide directs men nations always unseen intangible underlying force resultant spiritual forces certain people humanity finds outward expression public opinion 
use violence weakens force hinders corrupts tries replace another far conducive progress humanity detrimental 
bring sway christianity savage nations outside pale christian world zulus mandchoos chinese many regard savages savages live midst one means 
means propagation among nations christian ideal society realized christian life christian actions christian examples 
meanwhile though one means gaining hold people remained non christian men day set work directly opposite fashion attain result 
bring sway christianity savage nations attack us therefore excuse oppressing ought things leave peace case need wish enter closer relations ought influence christian manners christian teaching setting example christian virtues patience meekness endurance purity brotherhood love 
instead begin establishing among new markets commerce sole aim profit appropriate lands e rob sell spirits tobacco opium e corrupt establish morals among teach use violence new methods destruction e teach nothing animal law strife man sink conceal christian us 
send dozens missionaries prating hypocritical absurdities church quote failure efforts turn heathen christianity incontrovertible proof impossibility applying truths christianity practical life 
called criminals living midst 
bring people sway christianity one means christian social ideal realized among true christian teaching supported true example christian life 
preach christian truth support christian example set among prisons guillotines gallows preparations murder diffuse among common herd idolatrous superstitions stupefy sell spirits tobacco opium brutalize even organize legalized prostitution give land need make display senseless luxury midst suffering poverty destroy possibility anything like christian public opinion studiously try suppress christian public opinion existing 
assiduously corrupted men shut like wild beasts places escape become still brutalized else kill 
men corrupted brutalized every means bring forward proof one deal criminals except brute force 
like ignorant doctors put man recovering illness force nature unfavorable conditions hygiene dose deleterious drugs assert triumphantly hygiene drugs saved life patient would well long left alone 
violence held means supporting christian organization life fails produce effect even hinders social organization life might ought 
social organization good result force spite 
therefore champions existing order mistaken arguing since even aid force bad non christian elements humanity hardly kept attacking us abolition use force substitution public opinion would leave humanity quite unprotected 
mistaken force protect humanity contrary deprives possible means really protecting establishment diffusion christian public opinion

notice notice movement earth moved together everything around us 
true organization society remains principal features much organization based violence one thousand years ago even respects especially preparation war war appears still brutal 
rising christian ideal must certain stage development replace heathen ideal life already makes influence felt 
dead tree stands apparently firmly ever may even seem firmer harder rotten core soon must fall 
present order society based force 
external aspect unchanged 
division oppressors oppressed view significance dignity respective positions longer 
oppressors take part government profit oppression rich longer imagine elect world constitute ideal human happiness greatness attain highest aim oppressed 
often oppressed strive attain position oppressors try imitate contrary oppressors voluntarily abandon advantages position prefer condition oppressed try resemble simplicity life 
speak duties occupations openly despised spy agent secret police moneylender publican great number professions formerly regarded honorable police officials courtiers judges administrative functionaries clergymen military officers speculators bankers longer considered desirable positions everyone even despised special circle respected people 
already men voluntarily abandon professions reckoned irreproachable prefer less lucrative callings way connected use force 
even rich men religious sentiment simply special sensitiveness social standard springing relinquish inherited property believing man justly consume gained labor

consequently class wealthy government officials drawn grows less number lower intelligence education still moral qualities 
nowadays wealthy class men head government constitute former days lite society contrary inferior middle class 
russia turkey america france however often government change officials majority self seeking corrupt low moral standard even come elementary requirements common honesty expected government 
one may often nowadays hear persons authority na complaint best people always strange seems fatality found camp opposition 
though men complain accepted office hangman strange fatality persons little refinement beauty character 
cultivated refined people society nowadays found among rich used formerly rule 
rich mostly coarse money grubbers absorbed increasing hoard generally dishonest means else degenerate heirs money grubbers far playing prominent part society mostly treated general contempt
