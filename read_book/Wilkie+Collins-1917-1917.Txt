never went people houses excepting father lady daughter living near never received anybody roof 
proud certainly pride dread kept thus apart neighbors 
family suffered generations past horrible affliction hereditary insanity members shrank exposing calamity others must exposed mingled busy little world around 
frightful story crime committed past times two monktons near relatives first appearance insanity always supposed date needless shock one repeating 
enough say intervals almost every form madness appeared family monomania frequent manifestation affliction among 
particulars one two yet related father 
period youth three monktons left abbey mr mrs monkton child alfred heir property 
one member elder branch family alive mr monkton younger brother stephen 
unmarried man possessing fine estate scotland lived almost entirely continent bore reputation shameless profligate 
family wincot held almost little communication neighbors 
already mentioned father lady daughter privileged people admitted wincot abbey 
father old school college friend mr monkton accident brought much together later life continued intimacy wincot quite intelligible 
well able account friendly terms mrs elmslie lady alluded lived monktons 
late husband distantly related mrs monkton father daughter guardian 
even claims friendship regard never seemed strong enough explain intimacy mrs elmslie inhabitants abbey 
intimate however certainly one result constant interchange visits two families due time declared mr monkton son mrs elmslie daughter became attached 
opportunities seeing much young lady remember time delicate gentle lovable girl opposite appearance apparently character also alfred monkton 
perhaps one reason fell love 
attachment soon discovered far disapproved parents either side 
essential points except wealth elmslies nearly equals monktons want money bride consequence heir wincot 
alfred well known would succeed thirty thousand year father death 
thus though parents sides thought young people old enough married saw reason ada alfred engaged understanding united young monkton came age two years time 
person consulted matter parents father capacity ada guardian 
knew family misery shown many years ago mrs monkton husband cousin 
illness significantly called palliated careful treatment reported passed away 
father deceived 
knew hereditary taint still lurked viewed horror bare possibility reappearing one day children friend daughter positively refused consent marriage engagement 
result doors abbey doors mrs elmslie house closed 
suspension friendly intercourse lasted short time mrs monkton died 
husband fondly attached caught violent cold attending funeral 
cold neglected settled lungs 
months time followed wife grave alfred left master grand old abbey fair lands spread around 
period mrs elmslie indelicacy endeavor second time procure father consent marriage engagement

mrs elmslie always met polite hints one bold form answer 
first admitted existence reports monktons friends unwilling specify distinctly declared infamous calumnies 
hereditary taint died family generations back 
alfred best kindest sanest human beings 
loved study retirement ada sympathized tastes made choice unbiased hints dropped sacrificing marriage hints would viewed many insults mother whose affection monstrous call question 
way talking silenced people convince 
began suspect indeed actual truth mrs elmslie selfish worldly grasping woman wanted get daughter well married cared nothing consequences long saw ada mistress greatest establishment whole county

hardly one obstacle ill omened marriage removed father death another succeeded shape anxieties difficulties caused delicate state ada health 
doctors consulted directions result advice marriage must deferred miss elmslie must leave england certain time reside warmer climate south france remember rightly 
thus happened alfred came age ada mother departed continent union two young people understood indefinitely postponed 
curiosity felt neighborhood alfred monkton would circumstances
