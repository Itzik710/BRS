see well 
next days indeed singularly busy steamy little hothouse fussing charcoal lumps teak moss mysteries orchid cultivator 
considered wonderfully eventful time 
evening would talk new orchids friends reverted expectation something strange 
several vandas dendrobium died care presently strange orchid began show signs life 
delighted took housekeeper right away jam making see directly made discovery

housekeeper shrugged shoulders 
anyhow like said 
wedderburn felt little hurt dislike plant 
prevent talking orchids generally orchid particular whenever felt inclined 
queer things orchids said one day possibilities surprises 
know darwin studied fertilisation showed whole structure ordinary orchid flower contrived order moths might carry pollen plant plant 
well seems lots orchids known flower possibly used fertilisation way 
cypripediums instance insects known possibly fertilise never found seed 
form new plants runners tubers kind outgrowth 
easily explained 
puzzle flowers likely added orchid may something extraordinary way 
shall study 
often thought making researches darwin 
hitherto found time something else happened prevent 
leaves beginning unfold 
wish would come see said orchid house hot gave headache 
seen plant aerial rootlets foot long unfortunately reminded tentacles reaching something got dreams growing incredible rapidity 
settled entire satisfaction would see plant wedderburn admire leaves alone 
ordinary broad form deep glossy green splashes dots deep red towards base knew leaves quite like 
plant placed low bench near thermometer close simple arrangement tap dripped hot water pipes kept air steamy 
spent afternoons regularity meditating approaching flowering strange plant 
last great thing happened 
directly entered little glass house knew spike burst although great paloeonophis lowii hid corner new darling stood 
new odour air rich intensely sweet scent overpowered every crowded steaming little greenhouse 
directly noticed hurried strange orchid 
behold trailing green spikes bore three great splashes blossom overpowering sweetness proceeded 
stopped ecstasy admiration 
flowers white streaks golden orange upon petals heavy labellum coiled intricate projection wonderful bluish purple mingled gold 
could see genus altogether new one 
insufferable scent hot place blossoms swam eyes 
would see temperature right 
made step towards thermometer 
suddenly everything appeared unsteady 
bricks floor dancing 
white blossoms green leaves behind whole greenhouse seemed sweep sideways curve upward 
half past four cousin made tea according invariable custom 
wedderburn come tea 
worshipping horrid orchid told waited ten minutes 
watch must stopped 
go call 
went straight hothouse opening door called name 
reply 
noticed air close loaded intense perfume 
saw something lying bricks hot water pipes 
minute perhaps stood motionless 
lying face upward foot strange orchid 
tentacle like aerial rootlets longer swayed freely air crowded together tangle gray ropes stretched tight ends closely applied chin neck hands

saw one exultant tentacles upon cheek trickled little thread blood 
inarticulate cry ran towards tried pull away leech like suckers 
snapped two tentacles sap dripped red

thought tearing sucker rootlets one one another minute released dragging away horror 
white bleeding dozen circular patches 
odd job man coming garden amazed smashing glass saw emerge hauling inanimate body red stained hands 
moment thought impossible things 
bring water cried voice dispelled fancies 
unnatural alacrity returned water found weeping excitement wedderburn head upon knee wiping blood face 
matter said wedderburn opening eyes feebly closing 
go tell annie come go dr haddon said odd job man soon brought water added seeing hesitated tell come back 
presently wedderburn opened eyes seeing troubled puzzle position explained fainted hothouse 
orchid see said 
wedderburn lost good deal blood beyond suffered great injury 
gave brandy mixed pink extract meat carried upstairs bed 
housekeeper told incredible story fragments dr haddon

cold outer air blowing open door sickly perfume almost dispelled 
torn aerial rootlets lay already withered amidst number dark stains upon bricks

absolutely mystery

perhaps best authenticated case existence real vision distance 
explanation none forthcoming except professor wade thrown 
explanation invokes fourth dimension dissertation theoretical kinds space 
talk kink space seems mere nonsense may mathematician 
said nothing would alter fact place eight thousand miles away answered two points might yard away sheet paper yet brought together bending paper round 
reader may grasp argument certainly

moth butterfly trailing odd flavor pawkins kept coming walk though best keep mind

afternoon hapley called upon vicar argued upon theological questions

everything silent 
mrs colville said hapley calling staircase next morning hope alarm last night 
may well ask said mrs colville 
fact sleep walker last two nights without sleeping mixture 
nothing alarmed really 
sorry made ass 
go shoreham get stuff make sleep soundly 
ought done yesterday 
half way chalk pits moth came upon hapley

went leaping striking eddying insect 
suddenly trod nothing fell headlong 
gap sensations hapley found sitting heap flints front opening chalk pits leg twisted back 
strange moth still fluttering round head 
struck hand turning head saw two men approaching 
one village doctor 
occurred hapley lucky 
came mind extraordinary vividness one would ever able see strange moth except behoved keep silent 
late night however broken leg set feverish forgot self restraint

first human set eyes upon living haploteuthis first human survive little doubt wave bathing fatalities boating accidents traveled along coast cornwall devon early may due cause retired tea dealer name fison stopping sidmouth boarding house 
afternoon walking along cliff path sidmouth ladram bay 
cliffs direction high red face one place kind ladder staircase made 
near attention attracted first thought cluster birds struggling fragment food caught sunlight glistened pinkish white 
tide right object far remote across broad waste rock reefs covered dark seaweed interspersed silvery shining tidal pools 
moreover dazzled brightness water 
minute regarding perceived judgment fault struggle circled number birds jackdaws gulls part latter gleaming blindingly sunlight smote wings seemed minute comparison 
curiosity perhaps aroused strongly first insufficient explanations 
nothing better amuse decided make object whatever goal afternoon walk instead ladram bay conceiving might perhaps great fish sort stranded chance flapping distress 
hurried long steep ladder stopping intervals thirty feet take breath scan mysterious movement 
foot cliff course nearer object hand came incandescent sky beneath sun seem dark indistinct 
whatever pinkish hidden skerry weedy boulders 
perceived made seven rounded bodies distinct connected birds kept constant croaking screaming seemed afraid approach closely 
mr fison torn curiosity began picking way across wave worn rocks finding wet seaweed covered thickly rendered extremely slippery stopped removed shoes socks rolled trousers knees 
object course merely avoid stumbling rocky pools perhaps rather glad men excuse resume even moment sensations boyhood

approached mark assurance absolute security country forms animal life gives inhabitants 
round bodies moved fro surmounted skerry boulders mentioned realized horrible nature discovery

rounded bodies fell apart came sight ridge displayed pinkish object partially devoured body human whether man woman unable say 
rounded bodies new ghastly looking creatures shape somewhat resembling octopus huge long flexible tentacles coiled copiously ground 
skin glistening texture unpleasant see like shiny leather 
downward bend tentacle surrounded mouth curious excrescence bend tentacles large intelligent eyes gave creatures grotesque suggestion face

thinks seven eight least creatures 
twenty yards beyond amid surf returning tide two others emerging sea 
bodies lay flatly rocks eyes regarded evil interest appear mr fison afraid realized danger 
possibly confidence ascribed limpness attitudes 
horrified course intensely excited indignant revolting creatures preying upon human flesh 
thought chanced upon drowned body 
shouted idea driving finding budge cast picked big rounded lump rock flung one 
slowly uncoiling tentacles began moving towards creeping first deliberately making soft purring sound 
moment mr fison realized danger 
shouted threw boots started leap forthwith 
twenty yards stopped faced judging slow behold tentacles leader already pouring rocky ridge standing shouted time threatening cry dismay began jumping striding slipping wading across uneven expanse beach 
tall red cliffs seemed suddenly vast distance saw though creatures another world two minute workmen engaged repair ladder way little suspecting race life beginning 
one time could hear creatures splashing pools dozen feet behind slipped almost fell 
chased foot cliffs desisted joined workmen foot ladder way cliff 
three men pelted stones time hurried cliff top along path towards sidmouth secure assistance boat rescue desecrated body clutches abominable creatures 
ii 
already sufficient peril day mr fison went boat point exact spot adventure 
tide required considerable detour reach spot last came ladder way mangled body disappeared 
water running submerging first one slab slimy rock another four men boat workmen boatman mr fison turned attention bearings shore water beneath keel 
first could see little save dark jungle laminaria occasional darting fish 
minds set adventure expressed disappointment freely 
presently saw one monsters swimming water seaward curious rolling motion suggested mr fison spinning roll captive balloon 
almost immediately waving streamers laminaria extraordinarily perturbed parted moment three beasts became darkly visible struggling probably fragment drowned man 
moment copious olive green ribbons poured writhing group 
four men greatly excited began beating water oars shouting immediately saw tumultuous movement among weeds 
desisted see clearly soon water smooth saw seemed whole sea bottom among weeds set eyes 
ugly swine cried one men 
dozens forthwith things began rise water 
mr fison since described writer startling eruption waving laminaria meadows 
seemed occupy considerable time probable really affair seconds 
time nothing eyes speaks tentacles streaming parting weed fronds way 
things growing larger last bottom hidden intercoiling forms tips tentacles rose darkly air swell waters 
one came boldly side boat clinging three sucker set tentacles threw four others gunwale intention either oversetting boat clambering 
mr fison caught boat hook jabbing furiously soft tentacles forced desist 
struck back almost pitched overboard boatman using oar resist similar attack side boat 
tentacles either side relaxed hold slid sight splashed water 
better get said mr fison trembling violently 
went tiller boatman one workmen seated began rowing 
workman stood fore part boat boat hook ready strike tentacles might appear 
nothing else seems said 
mr fison expressed common feeling beyond amendment 
hushed scared mood faces white drawn set escaping position recklessly blundered 
oars scarcely dropped water dark tapering serpentine ropes bound rudder creeping sides boat looping motion came suckers 
men gripped oars pulled like trying move boat floating raft weeds 
help cried boatman mr fison second workman rushed help lug oar 
man boat hook name ewan ewen sprang curse began striking downward side far could reach bank tentacles clustered along boat bottom 
time two rowers stood get better purchase recovery oars 
boatman handed mr fison lugged desperately meanwhile boatman opened big clasp knife leaning side boat began hacking spiring arms upon oar shaft 
mr fison staggering quivering rocking boat teeth set breath coming short veins starting hands pulled oar suddenly cast eyes seaward 
fifty yards across long rollers incoming tide large boat standing towards three women little child 
boatman rowing little man pink ribboned straw hat whites stood stern hailing 
moment course mr fison thought help thought child 
abandoned oar forthwith threw arms frantic gesture screamed party boat keep away god sake says much modesty courage mr fison seem aware quality heroism action juncture 
oar abandoned drawn presently reappeared floating twenty yards away 
moment mr fison felt boat lurch violently hoarse scream prolonged cry terror hill boatman caused forget party excursionists altogether 
turned saw hill crouching forward row lock face convulsed terror right arm side drawn tightly 
gave succession short sharp cries oh oh oh oh mr fison believes must hacking tentacles water line grasped course quite impossible say certainly happened 
boat heeling gunwale within ten inches water ewan labourer striking water oar boat hook either side hill arm 
mr fison instinctively placed counterpoise 
hill burly powerful man made strenuous effort rose almost standing position 
lifted arm indeed clean water 
hanging complicated tangle brown ropes eyes one brutes hold glaring straight resolute showed momentarily surface 
boat heeled green brown water came pouring cascade side 
hill slipped fell ribs across side arm mass tentacles splashed back water 
rolled boot kicked mr fison knee gentleman rushed forward seize another moment fresh tentacles whipped waist neck brief convulsive struggle boat nearly capsized hill lugged overboard 
boat righted violent jerk sent mr fison side hid struggle water eyes 
stood staggering recover balance moment became aware struggle inflowing tide carried close upon weedy rocks 
four yards table rock still rose rhythmic movements wash tide 
moment mr fison seized oar ewan gave one vigorous stroke dropping ran bows leapt 
felt feet slide rock frantic effort leapt towards mass

knocked flat tidal pool one workmen went heard smothered choking cries believed time came hill

someone jumped curving rush foamy water poured passed 
scrambled feet dripping without looking seaward ran fast terror would let shoreward 
flat space scattered rocks stumbled two work men one dozen yards front

mr fison heart beating violently throbbing finger tips breath came deep 
something missing 
seconds could think clearly enough might

wondered whether imagined 
turned saw two workmen standing side side projecting masses tall pink cliffs 
hesitated whether make one last attempt save man hill

turned shoreward stumbling wading towards two companions

haploteuthis ferox made appearance upon devonshire coast 
far serious aggression 
mr fison account taken together wave boating bathing casualties already alluded absence fish cornish coasts year points clearly shoal voracious deep sea monsters prowling slowly along sub tidal coast line 
hunger migration know suggested force drove hither part prefer believe alternative theory hemsley 
hemsley holds pack shoal creatures may become enamoured human flesh accident foundered ship sinking among wandered search accustomed zone first waylaying following ships coming shores wake atlantic traffic 
discuss hemsley cogent admirably stated arguments would place 
would seem appetites shoal satisfied catch eleven people far ascertained ten people second boat certainly creatures gave signs presence sidmouth day 
coast seaton budleigh salterton patrolled evening night four preventive service boats men armed harpoons cutlasses evening advanced number less similarly equipped expeditions organised private individuals joined 
mr fison took part expeditions 
midnight excited hails heard boat couple miles sea south east sidmouth lantern seen waving strange manner fro 
nearer boats hurried towards alarm 
venturesome occupants boat seaman curate two schoolboys actually seen monsters passing boat 
creatures seems like deep sea organisms phosphorescent floating five fathoms deep like creatures moonshine blackness water tentacles retracted asleep rolling moving slowly wedge like formation towards south east 
people told story gesticulated fragments first one boat drew alongside another 
last little fleet eight nine boats collected together tumult like chatter market place rose stillness night 
little disposition pursue shoal people neither weapons experience dubious chase presently even certain relief may boats turned shoreward 
tell perhaps astonishing fact whole astonishing raid 
slightest knowledge subsequent movements shoal although whole south west coast alert 
may perhaps significant cachalot stranded sark june 
two weeks three days sidmouth affair living haploteuthis came ashore calais sands 
alive several witnesses saw tentacles moving convulsive way 
probable dying 
gentleman named pouchet obtained rifle shot 
last appearance living haploteuthis 
others seen french coast 
th june dead carcass almost complete washed ashore near torquay days later boat marine biological station engaged dredging plymouth picked rotting specimen slashed deeply cutlass wound 
former come death impossible say 
last day june mr egbert caine artist bathing near newlyn threw arms shrieked drawn

mr cave statements mr wace assures extremely circumstantial entirely free emotional quality taints hallucinatory impressions 
must remembered efforts mr wace see similar clarity faint opalescence crystal wholly unsuccessful try would 
difference intensity impressions received two men great quite conceivable view mr cave mere blurred nebulosity mr wace 
view mr cave described invariably extensive plain seemed always looking considerable height tower mast 
east west plain bounded remote distance vast reddish cliffs reminded seen picture picture mr wace unable ascertain 
cliffs passed north south could tell points compass stars visible night receding almost illimitable perspective fading mists distance met 
nearer eastern set cliffs occasion first vision sun rising black sunlight pale shadow appeared multitude soaring forms mr cave regarded birds 
vast range buildings spread seemed looking upon approached blurred refracted edge picture became indistinct 
also trees curious shape coloring deep mossy green exquisite gray beside wide shining canal 
something great brilliantly colored flew across picture 
first time mr cave saw pictures saw flashes hands shook head moved vision came went grew foggy indistinct 
first greatest difficulty finding picture direction lost 
next clear vision came week first interval yielded nothing tantalising glimpses useful experience showed view length valley 
view different curious persuasion subsequent observations abundantly confirmed regarding strange world exactly spot although looking different direction 
long facade great building whose roof looked upon receding perspective 
recognized roof 
front facade terrace massive proportions extraordinary length middle terrace certain intervals stood huge graceful masts bearing small shiny objects reflected setting sun 
import small objects occur mr cave time describing scene mr wace 
terrace overhung thicket luxuriant graceful vegetation beyond wide grassy lawn certain broad creatures form like beetles enormously larger reposed 
beyond richly decorated causeway pinkish stone beyond lined dense red weeds passing valley exactly parallel distant cliffs broad mirror like expanse water 
air seemed full squadrons great birds manoeuvring stately curves across river multitude splendid buildings richly colored glittering metallic tracery facets among forest moss like lichenous trees 
suddenly something flapped repeatedly across vision like fluttering jewelled fan beating wing face rather upper part face large eyes came close side crystal 
mr cave startled impressed absolute reality eyes drew head back crystal look behind

thing mr cave secret remained mere wonder thing creep covertly peep child might peep upon forbidden garden 
mr wace young scientific investigator particularly lucid consecutive habit mind 
directly crystal story came satisfied seeing phosphorescence eyes really certain evidence mr cave statements proceeded develop matter systematically 
mr cave eager come feast eyes wonderland saw came every night half past eight half past ten sometimes mr wace absence day 
sunday afternoons also came 
outset mr wace made copious notes due scientific method relation direction initiating ray entered crystal orientation picture proved 
covering crystal box perforated small aperture admit exciting ray substituting black holland buff blinds greatly improved conditions observations little able survey valley direction desired 
cleared way may give brief account visionary world within crystal 
things cases seen mr cave method working invariably watch crystal report saw mr wace science student learned trick writing dark wrote brief note report 
crystal faded put box proper position electric light turned 
mr wace asked questions suggested observations clear difficult points 
nothing indeed could less visionary matter fact 
attention mr cave speedily directed bird like creatures seen abundantly present earlier visions 
first impression soon corrected considered time might represent diurnal species bat 
thought grotesquely enough might cherubs 
heads round curiously human eyes one startled second observation 
broad silvery wings feathered glistening almost brilliantly new killed fish subtle play color wings built plan bird wing bat mr wace learned supported curved ribs radiating body 
sort butterfly wing curved ribs seems best express appearance 
body small fitted two bunches prehensile organs like long tentacles immediately mouth 
incredible appeared mr wace persuasion last became irresistible creatures owned great quasi human buildings magnificent garden made broad valley splendid 
mr cave perceived buildings peculiarities doors great circular windows opened freely gave creatures egress entrance 
would alight upon tentacles fold wings smallness almost rod like hop interior 
among multitude smaller winged creatures like great dragon flies moths flying beetles across greensward brilliantly colored gigantic ground beetles crawled lazily fro 
moreover causeways terraces large headed creatures similar greater winged flies wingless visible hopping busily upon hand like tangle tentacles 
allusion already made glittering objects upon masts stood upon terrace nearer building 
dawned upon mr cave regarding one masts fixedly one particularly vivid day glittering object crystal exactly like peered 
still careful scrutiny convinced one vista nearly twenty carried similar object 
occasionally one large flying creatures would flutter one folding wings coiling number tentacles mast would regard crystal fixedly space sometimes long fifteen minutes 
series observations made suggestion mr wace convinced watchers far visionary world concerned crystal peered actually stood summit end mast terrace one occasion least one inhabitants world looked mr cave face making observations 
much essential facts singular story 
unless dismiss ingenious fabrication mr wace believe one two things either mr cave crystal two worlds carried one remained stationary seems altogether absurd else peculiar relation sympathy another exactly similar crystal world seen interior one world suitable conditions visible observer corresponding crystal world vice versa 
present indeed know way two crystals could come en rapport nowadays know enough understand thing altogether impossible 
view crystals en rapport supposition occurred mr wace least seems extremely plausible world also alert intelligence mr wace speedily threw light 
sunset sky darkened rapidly brief twilight interval indeed stars shone 
recognisably see arranged constellations 
mr cave recognized bear pleiades aldebaran sirius world must somewhere solar system utmost hundreds millions miles 
following clue mr wace learned midnight sky darker blue even midwinter sky sun seemed little smaller 
two small moons like moon smaller quite differently marked one moved rapidly motion clearly visible one regarded 
moons never high sky vanished rose every time revolved eclipsed near primary planet 
answers quite completely although mr cave know must condition things mars 
indeed seems exceedingly plausible conclusion peering crystal mr cave actually see planet mars inhabitants 
case evening star shone brilliantly sky distant vision neither less familiar earth 
time martians martians seem known mr cave inspection 
twice one would come peer go away shortly mast though vision unsatisfactory 
time mr cave able watch proceedings winged people without disturbed attentions although report necessarily vague fragmentary nevertheless suggestive 
imagine impression humanity martian observer would get difficult process preparation considerable fatigue eyes able peer london steeple st martin church stretches longest four minutes time 
mr cave unable ascertain winged martians martians hopped causeways terraces latter could put wings 
several times saw certain clumsy bipeds dimly suggestive apes white partially translucent feeding among certain lichenous trees fled one hopping round headed martians 
latter caught one tentacles picture faded suddenly left mr cave tantalisingly dark 
another occasion vast thing mr cave thought first gigantic insect appeared advancing along causeway beside canal extraordinary rapidity 
drew nearer mr cave perceived mechanism shining metals extraordinary complexity 
looked passed sight

thus far observations progressed early november mr cave feeling suspicions family crystal allayed began take fro order occasion arose daytime night might comfort fast becoming real thing existence
