mentioned quite every day matter evidently without thinking extraordinary point antithesis honors heaped upon demosthenes

roman law find similar principles noxoe deditio gradually leading results 
twelve tables bc provided animal done damage either animal surrendered damage paid 
learn gains rule applied torts children slaves trace regard inanimate things 
roman lawyers looking beyond system time drew wits explanation would show law found reasonable 
gaius said unjust fault children slaves source loss parents owners beyond bodies ulpian reasoned fortiori true things devoid life therefore incapable fault 
way approaching question seems deal right surrender limitation liability incurred parent owner would naturally first instance unlimited

action followed guilty thing whosesoever hands came 
curious contrast principle inverted meet still modern views public policy animal wild nature case ferocious animals owner ceased liable moment escaped moment ceased owner 
seems extensive liability old law even slave guilty master knowledge unless perhaps mere tool master hands 
gains ulpian showed inclination cut noxoe deditio privilege owner case misdeeds committed without knowledge ulpian obliged admit ancient law according celsus action noxal slave guilty even privity master 
shows clearly liability owner merely way getting slave animal immediate cause offence 
words vengeance immediate offender object greek early roman process indemnity master owner 
liability owner simply liability offending thing 
primitive customs greece enforced judicial process expressly directed object animate inanimate 
roman twelve tables made owner instead thing defendant way change ground liability affect limit 
change simply device allow owner protect interest 
may asked inanimate objects came pursued way object procedure gratify passion revenge 
learned men ready find reason personification inanimate nature common savages children much confirm view 
without personification anger towards lifeless things would transitory 
noticeable commonest example primitive customs laws tree falls upon man falls killed 
conceive comparative ease tree might put footing animals 
certainly treated like delivered relatives chopped pieces gratification real simulated passion 
athenian process also doubt traced different thought 
expiation one ends insisted plato appears purpose procedure mentioned aeschines

another peculiarity noticed liability seems regarded attached body damage almost physical sense 
untrained intelligence imperfectly performs analysis jurists carry responsibility back beginning chain causation 
hatred anything giving us pain wreaks manifest cause leads even civilized man kick door pinches finger embodied noxoe deditio kindred doctrines early roman law 
defective passage gaius seems say liability may sometimes escaped giving even dead body offender 
livy relates brutulus papins caused breach truce romans samnites determined surrender upon avoiding disgrace punishment suicide sent lifeless body

curious examples sort occur region call contract 
livy furnishes example indeed last one 
roman consul postumius concluded disgraceful peace caudine forks per sponsionem livy says denying common story per feedus sent rome obtain sanction people

single creditor might put debtor death sell slave 
right given reduce debtor slavery law might taken look compensation modelled natural working self redress 
principle law taking man body execution satisfies debt although detained hour seems explained way

roman law dealt mainly living creatures animals slaves 
man run surrender wagon crushed ox drew wagon 
stage notion easy understand 
desire vengeance may felt strongly slave freeman without example nowadays like passion felt animal 
surrender slave beast empowered injured party upon 
payment owner merely privilege case wanted buy vengeance 
readily imagined system described could last civilization advanced considerable height 
privilege buying vengeance agreement paying damage instead surrendering body offender doubt became general custom 
aquilian law passed couple centuries later date twelve tables enlarged sphere compensation bodily injuries 
interpretation enlarged aquilian law 
masters became personally liable certain wrongs committed slaves knowledge previously bound surrender slave 
pack mule threw burden upon passer improperly overloaded dog might restrained escaped master bit one old noxal action called gave way action new law enforce general personal liability 
still later ship owners innkeepers made liable wrong doers wrongs committed employ board ship tavern although course committed without knowledge 
true reason exceptional responsibility exceptional confidence necessarily reposed carriers innkeepers 
jurists regarded surrender children slaves privilege intended limit liability explained new liability ground innkeeper ship owner certain degree guilty negligence employed services bad men first instance master made unconditionally liable wrongs servant 
reason given general application principle expanded scope reason 
law ship owners innkeepers introduced another startling innovation 
made responsible employed free well slaves 
first time one man made answerable wrongs another also answerable standing law 
great change bare permission ransom one slave privilege 
history whole modern doctrine master servant principal agent 
servants free liable suit masters 
yet principle introduced special grounds special case servants slaves general law country england men daily pay large sums people acts part sense blame 
day reason offered roman jurists exceptional rule made justify universal unlimited responsibility 
much one parents common law 
let us turn moment teutonic side 
salic law embodies usages probability early date influenced either rome old testament 
thirty sixth chapter ancient text provides man killed domestic animal owner animal shall pay half composition would pay buy blood feud killed man half give beast complainant 
chapter thirty five slave killed freeman surrendered one half composition relatives slain man master pay half 
according gloss slave master maltreated slain man relatives master surrender slave 
interesting notice northern sources wilda takes represent primitive stage german law confine liability animals surrender alone 
also trace master able free cases later date showing slave longer possession 
later provisions making master liable wrongs committed slave command 
laws adapted thuringians earlier sources provided terms master pay damage done slaves 
short far able trace order development customs german tribes seems entirely similar already followed growth roman law 
earlier liability slaves animals mainly confined surrender later became personal rome 
reader may begin ask proof bearing law today 
far concerns influence roman law upon especially roman law master servant evidence found every book written last five hundred years 
stated already still repeat reasoning roman lawyers empty present day 
seen directly whether german folk laws also followed england 
kentish laws hlothhaere eadrie ad said one slave slay freeman whoever let owner pay hundred shillings give slayer c several similar provisions 
nearly contemporaneous laws ine surrender payment simple alternatives 
wessex slave slay englishman shall owns deliver lord kindred give sixty shillings life 
alfred laws ad like provision cattle 
neat wound man let neat delivered compounded 
alfred although two hundred years later first english lawgivers quoted seems gone back primitive notions find time 
principle extended case tree man killed 
common work one man slay another unwilfully let tree given kindred let land within thirty nights 
let take possession owns wood 
inapposite compare mr tylor mentioned concerning rude kukis southern asia 
tiger killed kuki family disgrace till retaliated killing eating tiger another man killed fall tree relatives would take revenge cutting tree scattering chips 
return english later laws hundred years alfred collection known laws henry compiled long conquest increase lord liability household make surety men good conduct 
incur fine king run away lord pay unless clear complicity 
say find later period unlimited liability master servant worked continent german tribes rome 
whether principle established indigenous growth whether last step taken influence roman law bracton made great use say 
enough soil ready took root early day 
need said regard liability master misdeeds servants 
next shown became principle applied animals 
nowadays man bound peril keep cattle trespassing liable damage done dog fierce animal notice tendency brute harm complained 
question whether connection established sensible intelligible rules modern law surrender directed king alfred 
let us turn one old books scotch law old principle still appears full force stated reasons understood gif ane wylde head strang horse carries ane man craig heuch water man happin drowne horse sall perteine king escheit

reader see passage remarked already roman law distinction taken things capable guilt living dead things also see difficulty felt treating animals guilty 
take next early passage english law report laid one english judges 
stated law dog kills sheep freshly fact tender dog without recovery 
three centuries later said twisden j one hath kept tame fox gets loose grows wild hath kept shall answer damage fox doth hath lost hath resumed wild nature 
least doubtful whether sentence ever would written lingering influence notion ground owner liability ownership offending thing failure surrender 
fox escaped another principle law ownership end 
fact consideration seriously pressed england late regard monkey escaped bit plaintiff seems reasonable conjecture way thinking led lord holt near beginning last century intimate one ground man bound peril restrain cattle trespassing valuable property animals whereas dogs responsibility less 
day fact cautious judges state law cattle owner animal law right property exist bound take care stray land neighbor 
mean modern law subject survival change primitive notions substitute owner offending animal 
although probable early law one causes led modern doctrine much good sense every stage law adopt sweeping consequences would follow wholesale transfer liability supposed 
owner bound peril keep cattle harming neighbor person 
earliest instances personal liability even trespass neighbor land ground seems owner negligence 
nature animals common law recognizes subject ownership stray straying damage trampling eating crops 
time usual easy restrain 
hand dog subject property harm simply crossing land others owner 
hence extent new law might followed old 
right property offending animal ancient ground responsibility might adopted safely enough test liability based fault owner 
responsibility damage kind expected animals determined grounds policy comparatively little disturbed tradition 
development personal liability fierce wild animals rome explained 
law seems followed roman 
follow history branch primitive notion least likely survive liability inanimate things 
remembered king alfred ordained surrender tree later scotch law refused dead thing could guilt 
remembered also animals scotch law forfeited escheat king

said next reign oinne illud quod mover cum eo quod occidit homines deodandum domino regi erit vel feodo clerici 
reader sees motion gives life object forfeited 
striking example sort ship 
accordingly old books say man falls ship drowned motion ship must taken cause death ship forfeited provided however happens fresh water 
death took place high seas outside ordinary jurisdiction 
proviso supposed mean ships sea forfeited long series petitions king parliament forfeitures may done away tell different story 
truth seems forfeiture took place different court 
manuscript reign henry vi recently printed discloses fact man killed drowned sea motion ship vessel forfeited admiral upon proceeding admiral court subject release favor admiral king 
ship living inanimate things 
servants sometimes say clock every one gives gender vessels 
need surprised therefore find mode dealing shown extraordinary vitality criminal law applied even striking thoroughness admiralty

collision takes place two vessels ticonderoga melampus fault ticonderoga alone 
ship lease time lessee master charge owner vessel manner control 
owner therefore blame even charged ground damage done servants 
free personal liability elementary principles 
yet perfectly settled lien vessel amount damage done means vessel may arrested sold pay loss admiralty court whose process reach 
livery stable keeper lets horse wagon customer runs man careless driving one would think claiming right seize horse wagon 
would seen property could sold pay wrong property wrong doer 
suppose vessel instead lease charge pilot whose employment made compulsory laws port entering 
supreme court united states holds ship liable instance also 
english courts would probably decided otherwise matter settled england legislation 
court appeal privy council largely composed common law lawyers shown marked tendency assimilate common law doctrine 
common law one could impose personal liability owner could bind particular chattel answer wrong instrument 
supreme court long recognized person may bind ship could bind owners personally agent 
may admitted doctrine supported appearance good sense would survived 
ship security available dealing foreigners rather send one citizens search remedy abroad strange courts easy seize vessel satisfy claim home leaving foreign owners get indemnity may able 
dare say thought helped keep practice alive believe true historic foundation elsewhere 
ship doubt like sword would forfeited causing death whosesoever hands might 
master mariners ship furnished letters reprisal committed piracy friend king owner lost ship admiralty law although crime committed without knowledge assent 
seems likely principle ship forfeited king causing death piracy bound private sufferers damage whose hands soever might harm 
say uneducated man today ought pay may doubted whether would see fallacy ready explain ship property say ship pay simply dramatic way saying somebody property sold proceeds applied pay wrong committed somebody else 
would seem similar form words enough satisfy minds great lawyers 
following passage judgment chief justice marshall quoted approval judge story giving opinion supreme court united states proceeding owner proceeding vessel offence committed vessel less offence less subject forfeiture committed without authority owner 
true inanimate matter commit offence 
body animated put action crew guided master 
vessel acts speaks master

therefore unreasonable vessel affected report 
judge story quotes another case thing primarily considered offender rather offence primarily attached thing 
words great judges although course aware ship alive mill wheel thought law fact deal alive reasonable law 
reader observe say simply reasonable grounds policy sacrifice justice owner security somebody else reasonable deal vessel offending thing 
whatever hidden ground policy may thought still clothes personifying language 
let us go follow peculiarities maritime law directions

rule already prevailed borrowed adopted english statutes act congress according owner discharged responsibility wrongful acts master appointed upon surrendering interest vessel freight earned

lecture ii 
criminal law 
beginning first lecture shown appeals early law directed intentional wrongs 
appeal far older form procedure indictment may said criminal well civil aspect 
double object satisfying private party loss king breach peace 
civil side rooted vengeance 
proceeding recover compositions first optional afterwards compulsory wrong doer bought spear side 
whether far concerned king object vengeance particularly directed revenue matter since claim king enlarge scope action 
would seem fair inference indictable offences originally limited way gave rise appeal 
whether indictment arose splitting appeal way two closely connected 
acquittal appellee merits bar indictment hand appeal fairly started although appellor might fail prosecute might defeated plea cause might still proceeded behalf king 
presentment parent criminal procedure origin distinct appeal 
thought merely successor fresh suit lynch law also child vengeance even clearly 
desire vengeance imports opinion object actually personally blame 
takes internal standard objective external one condemns victim 
question whether standard still accepted either primitive form refined development commonly supposed seems impossible considering relative slowness criminal law improved 
certainly may argued force never ceased one object punishment satisfy desire vengeance 
argument made plain considering instances one reason another compensation wrong question 
thus act may kind make indemnity impossible putting end principal sufferer case murder manslaughter 
crimes like forgery although directed individual tend make others feel unsafe general insecurity admit paid 
cases means enforcing indemnity 
macaulay draft indian penal code breaches contract carriage passengers made criminal 
palanquin bearers india poor pay damages yet trusted carry unprotected women children wild desolate tracts desertion would placed charge great danger 
cases punishment remains alternative 
pain inflicted upon wrong doer sort restore injured party former situation another equally good inflicted purpose causing pain 
far punishment takes place compensation whether account death person wrong done indefinite number persons affected impossibility estimating worth suffering money poverty criminal may said one objects gratify desire vengeance 
prisoner pays body 
statement may made stronger still may said law ought make gratification revenge object 
opinion rate two authorities great opposed views bishop butler jeremy bentham 
sir james stephen says criminal law stands passion revenge much relation marriage sexual appetite 
first requirement sound body law correspond actual feelings demands community whether right wrong 
people would gratify passion revenge outside law law help law choice satisfy craving thus avoid greater evil private retribution 
time passion one encourage either private individuals lawmakers 
moreover cover whole ground 
crimes excite naturally expect important purposes punishment would coextensive whole field application 
remains discovered whether general purpose exists 
different theories still divide opinion upon subject 
thought purpose punishment reform criminal deter criminal others committing similar crimes retribution 
would maintain first purposes one 
every prisoner released soon appears clear never repeat offence incurable punished 
course would hard reconcile punishment death doctrine 
main struggle lies two 
one side notion mystic bond wrong punishment infliction pain means end 
hegel one great expounders former view puts quasi mathematical form wrong negation right punishment negation negation retribution 
thus punishment must equal sense proportionate crime function destroy 
others without logical apparatus content rely upon felt necessity suffering follow wrong 
objected preventive theory immoral overlooks ill desert wrong furnishes measure amount punishment except lawgiver subjective opinion regard sufficiency amount preventive suffering 
language kant treats man thing person means end 
said conflict sense justice violate fundamental principle free communities members communities equal rights life liberty personal security 
spite probably english speaking lawyers would accept preventive theory without hesitation 
violation equal rights charged may replied dogma equality makes equation individuals individual community 
society ever admitted could sacrifice individual welfare existence 
conscripts necessary army seizes marches bayonets rear death 
runs highways railroads old family places spite owner protest paying instance market value sure civilized government sacrifices citizen help still sacrificing welfare rest 
necessary trench upon field morals might suggested dogma equality applied even individuals within limits ordinary dealings common run affairs 
argue neighbor except admission moment wise although may means believe 
way deal free choose except footing equal treatment rules 
ever growing value set upon peace social relations tends give law social appearance law 
seems clear ultima ratio regum private persons force bottom private relations however tempered sympathy social feelings justifiable self preference 
man plank deep sea float one stranger lays hold thrust 
state finds similar position thing 
considerations answer argument equal rights also answer objections treating man thing like 
man lives society liable find treated 
degree civilization people reached doubt marked anxiety would done 
may destiny man social instincts shall grow control actions absolutely even anti social situations 
yet done rules law based upon morality generally accepted rule founded theory absolute unselfishness laid without breach law working beliefs 
true shall presently try show general principles criminal civil liability follow alone theory fact agree frequently punishing guilty moral wrong could condemned standard avowedly disregard personal peculiarities individuals concerned 
punishment stood moral grounds proposed first thing considered would limitations capacity choosing rightly arise abnormal instincts want education lack intelligence defects marked criminal classes 
say least need argument 
say criminal law good harm 
say enacted administered theory 
remains mentioned affirmative argument favor theory retribution effect fitness punishment following wrong axiomatic instinctively recognized unperverted minds 
think seen self inspection feeling fitness absolute unconditional case neighbors 
seem one satisfied act wrong never would feel least need propriety earthly punishing power alone made suffer done although third persons introduced might philosopher admit necessity hurting frighten others 
neighbors wrong sometimes feel fitness making smart whether repented 
feeling fitness seems vengeance disguise already admitted vengeance element though chief element punishment 
supposed intuition fitness seem coextensive thing accounted 
lesser punishments fit lesser crimes greater greater 
demand crime followed punishment therefore equal absolute 
malum prohibitum much crime malum se 
general ground punishment must apply one case much 
hardly said wrong case supposed consisted breach revenue laws government indemnified loss feel internal necessity man thoroughly repented wrong punished except ground act known others 
known law would verify threats order others might believe tremble 
fact secret sovereign subject sovereign wholly free passion would undoubtedly see punishment case wholly without justification 
hand case law maker makes certain conduct criminal without thereby showing wish purpose prevent conduct 
prevention would accordingly seem chief universal purpose punishment 
law threatens certain pains certain things intending thereby give new motive 
persist inflict pains order threats may continue believed 
true account law stands law undoubtedly treat individual means end uses tool increase general welfare expense 
suggested course perfectly proper even wrong criminal law follows theory criminal law must shaped accordingly 
evidence law exceeds limits retribution subordinates consideration individual public well found doctrines satisfactorily explained ground 
first even deliberate taking life punished way saving one 
principle clearly established next mentioned support great authority 
law must go one two grounds either self preference proper case supposed even improper law prevent punishment threat death future time never sufficiently powerful motive make man choose death order avoid threat 
former ground adopted admits single person may sacrifice another fortiori people may 
latter view taken abandoning punishment longer expected prevent act law abandons retributive adopts preventive theory 
next doctrine leads still clearer conclusions 
ignorance law excuse breaking 
substantive principle sometimes put form rule evidence every one presumed know law 
accordingly defended austin others ground difficulty proof 
justice requires fact ascertained difficulty ground refusing try 
every one must feel ignorance law could never admitted excuse even fact could proved sight hearing every case 
furthermore parties testify may doubted whether man knowledge law harder investigate many questions gone 
difficulty would met throwing burden proving ignorance lawbreaker 
principle explained saying commanded abstain certain acts also find commanded 
second command clear guilt failing obey would bear proportion disobeying principal command known yet failure know would receive punishment failure obey principal law 
true explanation rule accounts law indifference man particular temperament faculties forth 
public policy sacrifices individual general good 
desirable burden equal still desirable put end robbery murder 
doubt true many cases criminal could known breaking law admit excuse would encourage ignorance law maker determined make men know obey justice individual rightly outweighed larger interests side scales 
foregoing arguments sound already manifest liability punishment finally absolutely determined considering actual personal unworthiness criminal alone 
consideration govern far public welfare permits demands 
take account general result criminal law intended bring shall see actual state mind accompanying criminal act plays different part commonly supposed 
part purpose criminal law induce external conformity rule 
law directed conditions things manifest senses

begin murder 
murder defined sir james stephen digest criminal law unlawful homicide malice aforethought 
earlier work explained malice meant wickedness law determined states mind wicked necessary degree 
without preliminary continues digest follows malice aforethought means one following states mind intention cause death grievous bodily harm person whether person person actually killed b knowledge act causes death probably cause death grievous bodily harm person whether person person actually killed although knowledge accompanied indifference whether death grievous bodily harm caused wish may caused c intent commit felony whatever intent oppose force officer justice way returning execution duty arresting keeping custody imprisoning person lawfully entitled arrest keep custody imprison duty keeping peace dispersing unlawful assembly provided offender notice person killed officer employed 
malice used common speech includes intent something 
act said done intent harm meant wish harm motive act 
intent however perfectly consistent harm regretted wished means something else 
act said done maliciously meant wish harmful effect motive also harm wished sake austin would say accuracy sake pleasurable feeling knowledge suffering caused act would excite 
apparent sir james stephen enumeration two elements malice intent alone material murder 
much murder shoot sentry purpose releasing friend shoot hate 
malice definition murder meaning common speech view considerations mentioned thought mean criminal intention 
intent found resolve two things foresight certain consequences follow act wish consequences working motive induces act 
question whether intent turn reduced lower term 
sir james stephen statement shows knowledge act probably cause death foresight consequences act enough murder tort 
instance newly born child laid naked doors must perish matter course 
none less murder guilty party would glad stranger find child save 
foresight consequences picture future state things called knowledge present state things future viewed standing present relation effect cause 
must seek reduction lower terms 
known present state things act done certainly cause death probability matter common knowledge one act knowing present state things guilty murder law inquire whether actually foresee consequences 
test foresight criminal foresaw man reasonable prudence would foreseen 
hand must actual present knowledge present facts make act dangerous 
act enough 
act true imports intention certain sense 
muscular contraction something 
spasm act 
contraction muscles must willed 
adult master foresees mysterious accuracy outward adjustment follow inward effort adjustment may said intended 
intent necessarily accompanying act ends 
nothing would follow act except environment 
acts taken apart surrounding circumstances indifferent law 
instance crook forefinger certain force act whether trigger pistol next 
surrounding circumstances pistol loaded cocked human relation manifestly likely hit make act wrong 
hence sufficient foundation liability sound principle proximate cause loss act 
reason requiring act act implies choice felt impolitic unjust make man answerable harm unless might chosen otherwise 
choice must made chance contemplating consequence complained else bearing responsibility consequence 
true man might held answerable everything would happened choice past time 
instance fit fallen man would done chosen come city taken ill 
foresight future choice regard possible consequence action depends known moment choosing 
act wrong even done circumstances hurtful unless circumstances ought known 
fear punishment causing harm work motive unless possibility harm may foreseen 
far criminal liability founded upon wrong sense far threats punishments law intended deter men bringing various harmful results must confined cases circumstances making conduct dangerous known 
still limited way principle applies knowledge applies foresight 
enough circumstances actually known would led man common understanding infer rest group making present state things 
instance workman house top mid day knows space street great city knows facts man common understanding would infer people passing 
therefore bound draw inference words chargeable knowledge fact also whether draws inference 
throws heavy beam street act person ordinary prudence would foresee likely cause death grievous bodily harm dealt foresaw whether fact 
death caused act guilty murder 
workman reasonable cause believe space private yard every one excluded used rubbish heap act blameworthy homicide mere misadventure 
make act causes death murder actor ought principle know notice facts make act dangerous 
certain exceptions principle stated presently less application murder smaller statutory crimes 
general rule prevails part murder 
furthermore principle danger fact exists known circumstances ought class man reasonable prudence could foresee 
ignorance fact inability foresee consequence effect blameworthiness 
consequence foreseen avoided 
practical difference whereas cases question knowledge question actual condition defendant consciousness question might foreseen determined standard prudent man general experience 
remembered object law prevent human life endangered taken although far considers blameworthiness punishing hold man responsible consequences one exceptional specialist could foreseen still reason limitation simply make rule hard average member community 
purpose compel men abstain dangerous conduct merely restrain evil inclinations law requires peril know teachings common experience requires know law 
subject explanations may said test murder degree danger life attending act known circumstances case 
needs explanation show particular defendant reason foresee ordinary man reasonable prudence would foreseen ground exemption longer applies 
harmful act excused ground party neither foresee could proper care foreseen harm 
would seem first sight analysis ought exhaust whole subject murder 
without explanation 
man forcibly resists officer lawfully making arrest kills knowing officer may murder although act done official function would criminal 
man act intent commit felony thereby accidentally kills another instance fires chickens intending steal accidentally kills owner see 
case last seems hardly reconcilable general principles laid 
argued somewhat follows blameworthy act firing chickens knowing belong another 
neither less accident happens afterwards hitting man whose presence could suspected accident 
fact shooting felonious make likely kill people 
object rule prevent accidents make accidental killing firearms murder accidental killing effort steal object prevent stealing would better hang one thief every thousand lot 
still law intelligible stands 
general test murder degree danger attending acts known state facts 
certain acts regarded peculiarly dangerous certain circumstances legislator may make punishable done circumstances although danger generally known 
law often takes step although nowadays often inflict death cases 
sometimes goes even requires man find present facts well foresee future harm peril although would necessarily inferred facts known 
thus statutory offence england abduct girl sixteen possession person lawful charge 
man acts induce girl sixteen leave parents chargeable reason know lawful charge parents may presumed would reasonable cause believe boy 
knowingly abducts girl parents must find age peril 
defense every reason think sixteen 
prohibitory liquor law held man sells plantation bitters defense know intoxicating 
examples kind 
experience shows deemed law maker show somehow deaths evidence makes accidental happen disproportionately often connection felonies resistance officers ground policy deemed desirable make special efforts prevention deaths lawmaker may consistently treat acts known circumstances felonious constitute resistance officers sufficiently dangerous tendency put special ban 
law may therefore throw actor peril consequences foreseen also consequences although predicted common experience legislator apprehends 
however mean argue rules discussion arose reasoning right would generally applied country 
returning main line thought instructive consider relation manslaughter murder 
one great difference two found lie degree danger attaching act given state facts 
man strikes another small stick likely kill reason suppose slight bodily harm kill commits manslaughter murder 
blow struck hard possible iron bar inch thick murder 
time striking switch party knows additional fact reason foresees death consequence slight blow instance heart disease offence equally murder 
explode barrel gunpowder crowded street kill people murder although actor hopes harm done 
kill man careless riding street would commonly manslaughter 
perhaps however case could put riding manifestly dangerous would murder 
recur example used already another purpose workman flings stone piece timber street kills man may either misadventure manslaughter murder according circumstances original act done country village passengers calls people care misadventure london populous town people continually passing manslaughter though gives loud warning murder knows passing gives warning 
law manslaughter contains another doctrine referred order complete understanding general principles criminal law 
doctrine provocation may reduce offence would otherwise murder manslaughter 
according current morality man much blame act done disturbance great excitement caused wrong done calm 
law made govern men motives must therefore take mental constitution account 
might urged side object punishment prevention heaviest punishment threatened strongest motive needed restrain primitive legislation seems sometimes gone principle 
threat restrain man passion threat less death sufficient therefore extreme penalty thought excessive 
time objective nature legal standards shown even 
mitigation come fact defendant beside rage 
enough grounds would effect every man standing education 
insulting words provocation although day still law established many people would rather die suffer without action 
must provocation sufficient justify passion law decides general considerations provocations sufficient 
said even law admits provocation extenuate guilt homicide unless person provoked time deed deprived power self control provocation received 
obvious reasons taking actual state defendant consciousness account extent 
ground applying general rule defendant state could expected remember influenced fear punishment could ground exception disappears 
yet even rightly wrongly law gone far direction adopting external tests 
courts seem decided murder manslaughter grounds nature weapon used length time provocation act 
cases question whether prisoner deprived self control passion left jury 
object lecture give outline criminal law explain general theory shall consider offences throw special light upon subject shall treat order seems best fitted purpose 
useful take malicious mischief compare malice required constitute offence malice aforethought murder 
charge malice aforethought indictment murder shown mean state defendant mind often thought except sense knew circumstances fact make conduct dangerous 
truth allegation like negligence asserts party accused come legal standard action circumstances found also exceptional fact excuse present took case general rule 
averment conclusion law permitted abridge facts positive negative founded 
statute punishes wilfully maliciously injuring another property arguable clear something meant 
presumption second word added without meaning seconded unreasonableness making every wilful trespass criminal 
reasoning prevails maliciously used popular sense imports motive defendant act wish harm owner property thing living end sake harm 
malice sense nothing common malice murder 
statutory law need profess consistent theory adopted judicial decisions 
hence strictly need reconcile statute principles explained 
inconsistency 
although punishment must confined compelling external conformity rule conduct far always avoided avoiding certain acts required whatever intent whatever motive still prohibited conduct may hurtful unless accompanied particular state feeling 
common disputes property satisfactorily settled compensation 
every one knows sometimes secret harm done neighbor neighbor pure malice spite 
damage paid malignity calls revenge difficulty detecting authors wrongs always done secretly affords ground punishment even revenge thought insufficient 
far law go direction hard say 
crime arson defined malicious wilful burning house another man generally discussed close connection malicious mischief 
thought burning malicious prisoner set fire prison desire consume building solely effect escape 
seems better opinion arson case intentional burning malicious within meaning rule 
remember arson subject one old appeals take us far back early law may readily understand intentional burnings redressed way 
appeal arson brother appeal de pace et plagis 
latter founded warlike assault former supposed house firing robbery revenge njal perished icelandic saga 
crime seems history others 
soon intent admitted sufficient law high road external standard 
man intentionally sets fire house near houses fire manifestly endanger guilty arson one houses burned consequence 
case act would arson taking immediate consequences account becomes arson reason remote consequences manifestly likely follow whether actually intended 
may effect setting fire things man right burn far alone concerned principle effect act equally likely surrounding circumstances cause harm 
cases may easily imagined firing gun making chemical mixture piling oiled rags twenty things might manifestly dangerous highest degree actually lead conflagration 
cases crime held committed external standard reached analysis made murder applies 
another class cases intent plays important part quite different reasons offered account law malicious mischief 
obvious examples class criminal attempts 
attempt intent course two distinct things 
intent commit crime criminal 
law man intending commit murder day tomorrow 
law deals conduct 
attempt overt act 
differs attempted crime act failed bring result would given character principal crime 
attempt murder results death within year day murder 
attempt steal results carrying owner goods larceny 
act done natural probable effect circumstances accomplishment substantive crime criminal law may properly enough moderate severity punishment act effect particular case hardly abstain altogether punishing theory 
argued actual intent give act criminal character instances 
views advanced murder manslaughter sound principles ought logically determine criminality acts general 
acts judged tendency known circumstances actual intent accompanies 
may true region attempts elsewhere law began cases actual intent cases obvious ones 
stop unless attaches importance etymological meaning word attempt general principles punishment 
accordingly least color authority proposition act punishable attempt supposing produced natural probable effect would amounted substantive crime 
acts punishable attempts 
another class actual intent clearly necessary existence class well name attempt doubt tends affect whole doctrine 
acts may attempts misdemeanors could effected crime unless followed acts part wrong doer 
instance lighting match intent set fire haystack held amount criminal attempt burn although defendant blew match seeing watched 
purchase dies making counterfeit coin misdemeanor although course coin would counterfeited unless dies used 
cases law goes new principle different governing substantive crimes 
reason punishing act must generally prevent harm foreseen likely follow act circumstances done 
substantive crimes ground likelihood stands common working natural causes shown experience 
act punished natural effect harmful circumstances ground alone suffice 
probability exist unless grounds expecting act done followed acts connection effect harmful although otherwise 
fact acts followed general assumed mere done would followed actor interrupted 
would followed unless actor chosen way generally available show would chosen showing intended 
accompanying intent case renders otherwise innocent act harmful raises probability followed acts events together result harm 
importance intent show act wicked show likely followed hurtful consequences 
readily seen limits kind liability 
law punish every act done intent bring crime 
man starts boston cambridge purpose committing murder gets stopped draw goes home punishable sat chair resolved shoot somebody second thoughts given notion 
hand slave ran white woman desisted caught convicted attempt commit rape 
seen amounts attempt burn haystack said case defendant gone buy box matches purpose would liable 
eminent judges puzzled draw line even state principle drawn two sets cases 
principle believed similar lines drawn law 
public policy say legislative considerations bottom matter considerations case nearness danger greatness harm degree apprehension felt 
man buys matches fire haystack starts journey meaning murder end still considerable chance change mind comes point 
struck match cocked aimed pistol little chance persist end danger becomes great law steps 
object could used innocently point intervention might put back case purchase die coining 
degree apprehension may affect decision well degree probability crime accomplished 
doubt fears peculiar slaveowning community share conviction mentioned 
one doubtful point passed 
thought shoot block wood thinking man attempt murder put hand empty pocket intending pick attempt commit larceny although latter question difference opinion 
reason given act could effected crime actor allowed follow results nature things could led attempt commit crime interrupted 
point course law must adopt conclusion unless goes theory retribution guilt prevention harm 
even prevent harm effectually exact 
suppose firing pistol man intent kill less attempt murder bullet misses aim 
yet act produced whole effect possible course nature 
impossible bullet circumstances hit man pick empty pocket 
difficulty saying act circumstances dangerous far possibility human foresight concerned punished 
one absolutely know though many would pretty sure exactly bullet strike harm done great harm 
man fires block harm possibly ensue theft committed empty pocket besides harm successful theft less murder 
yet might said even things punished order make discouragement broad enough easy understand 
remain considered certain substantive crimes differ important ways murder like explanation foregoing analysis intent criminal attempts analogous misdemeanors found service 
type larceny 
name acts punished would sufficient accomplish evil law seeks prevent treated equally criminal whether evil accomplished 
murder manslaughter arson hand committed unless evil accomplished consist acts tendency surrounding circumstances hurt destroy person property mere working natural laws 
larceny consequences immediately flowing act generally exhausted little harm owner 
goods removed possession trespass crime complete 
must permanently kept harm done law seeks prevent 
momentary loss possession guarded severe penalties 
law means prevent loss wholly forever shown fact larceny take temporary use without intending deprive owner property 
law punishes mere act taking punishes act produce evil effect sought prevented punishes effect way come pass 
reason plain enough 
law wait property used destroyed hands owner owner died order make sure harm seeks prevent done 
reason confine acts likely harm 
harm permanent loss property follow act taking series acts constitute removing keeping property taken 
preliminaries bearing intent upon crime easily seen 
according mr bishop larceny taking removing trespass personal property trespasser knows belong either generally specially another intent deprive owner ownership therein perhaps added sake advantage trespasser proposition decisions harmonious 
must intent deprive owner ownership therein said 
law anxious put man prison stealing unless actually wicked hang killing another hardly 
true answer intent index external event probably would happened law punish must case go probabilities accomplished facts 
analogy manner dealing attempts plain 
theft may called attempt permanently deprive man property punished severity whether successful 
theft rightly considered way intent must play part attempts 
act fully accomplish prohibited result may made wrongful evidence interference would followed acts co ordinated produce result 
shown showing intent 
theft intent deprive owner property establishes thief would retained would taken steps restore stolen goods 
would matter thief afterwards changed mind returned goods 
point view attempt crime already complete property carried 
may objected view intent makeshift practical necessity takes place actual deprivation ought required actual deprivation wholly accomplished provided criminal act produces whole effect 
suppose instance one motion man seizes backs another horse precipice 
whole evil law seeks prevent natural manifestly certain consequence act known circumstances 
case law larceny consistent theories maintained act passed upon according tendency actual intent wrong doer way considered 
yet possible say least even case intent would make difference 
assume act without excuse wrongful would amounted larceny done purpose depriving owner horse 
nevertheless done sake experiment without actual foresight destruction evil design owner trespasser might held thief 
inconsistency one seems explained way law grown 
distinctions common law theft broad theory legislation highly technical largely dependent upon history explanation 
type theft taking one user used sometimes still thought taking must lucri catesa sake advantage thief 
cases owner deprived property thief keeping destruction permanence loss judged beforehand intent keep 
intent therefore always necessary naturally stated form self regarding intent 
advance old precedents decided intent deprive owner property sufficient 
late english judges stood six five favor proposition larceny take horse intending kill purpose destroy evidence friend 
even case however away universality intent test destruction followed taking ancient rule criminality act must determined state things time taking afterwards 
whether law larceny would follow seems general principle criminal law would held back tradition could decided case like supposed act accomplishes taking destruction 
suggested already tradition might possibly prevail 
another crime peculiarities noticed larceny still clearly marked time easily explained burglary 
defined breaking entering dwelling house night intent commit felony therein 
object punishing breaking entering prevent trespasses even committed night trespasses first step wrongs greater magnitude like robbery murder 
case function intent proved appears clearly theft precisely similar 
index probability certain future acts law seeks prevent 
law gives evidence true explanation 
apprehended act follow longer necessary allege breaking entering intent 
indictment burglary charges defendant broke dwelling house stole certain property good one alleges broke intent steal 
believed enough said explain general theory criminal liability stands common law 
result may summed follows 
acts indifferent per se 
characteristic type substantive crime acts rendered criminal done finder circumstances probably cause harm law seeks prevent 
test criminality cases degree danger shown experience attend act circumstances 
cases mens rea actual wickedness party wholly unnecessary reference state consciousness misleading means anything circumstances connection tendency act judged circumstances known 
even requirement knowledge subject certain limitations 
man must find peril things reasonable prudent man would inferred things actually known 
cases especially statutory crimes must go even knows certain facts must find peril whether facts present would make act criminal 
man abducts girl parents england must find peril whether sixteen 
cases may consequence act circumstances must actually foreseen consequence prudent man would foreseen 
reference prudent man standard form blameworthiness element crime would blameworthy man element first survival true moral standards second punish would blameworthy average member community would enforce standard indefensible theoretically practically high community

law torts abounds moral phraseology 
much say wrongs malice fraud intent negligence 
hence may naturally supposed risk man conduct thrown upon result moral short coming 
notion entertained extreme opposite found far popular opinion mean notion man answerable consequences acts words acts peril always wholly irrespective state consciousness upon matter 
test former opinion would natural take successively several words negligence intent language morals designate various well understood states mind show significance law 
test latter would perhaps convenient consider head several forms action 
many authorities decisions one another forms safe neglect least first instance compromise two modes approaching subject may reached beginning action trespass notion negligence together leaving wrongs defined intentional next lecture 
trespass lies unintentional well intended wrongs 
wrongful direct application force redressed action 
therefore affords fair field discussion general principles liability unintentional wrongs common law 
hardly supposed man responsibility consequences acts varies remedy happens fall one side penumbra separates trespass action case 
greater part law torts found one two heads 
might hastily assumed action case founded defendant negligence 
doctrine must prevail trespass 
might assumed trespass founded defendant caused damage act without regard negligence 
true law must apply criterion wrongs differing trespass technical point instance property damaged defendant possession 
neither assumptions however hastily permitted 
might well argued action case adopts severe rule suggested trespass except action founded contract 
negligence might said nothing common law liability nuisance might added negligence ground liability special duty founded defendant super se assumpsit public calling 
hand shall see said proposition even trespass must least negligence 
whichever argument prevails one form action must prevail 
discussion may therefore shortened technical side confining trespass far may practicable without excluding light got parts law 
hinted two theories common law liability unintentional harm 
seem receive implied assent popular textbooks neither wanting plausibility semblance authority 
first austin essentially theory criminalist 
according characteristic feature law properly called sanction detriment threatened imposed sovereign disobedience sovereign commands 
greater part law makes man civilly answerable breaking austin compelled regard liability action sanction words penalty disobedience 
follows according prevailing views penal law liability ought based upon personal fault austin accepts conclusion corollaries one negligence means state party mind 
doctrines referred later far necessary 
theory directly opposed foregoing 
seems adopted greatest common law authorities requires serious discussion set aside favor third opinion may maintained 
according view broadly stated common law man acts peril 
may held sort set never liable omissions except consequence duty voluntarily undertaken 
whole sufficient ground liabilities incur outside last class supposed voluntarily acted damage ensued 
act voluntary totally immaterial detriment followed neither intended due negligence actor 
order justice way looking subject must remember abolition common law forms pleading changed rules substantive law 
hence although pleaders generally allege intent negligence anything would formerly sufficient charge defendant trespass still sufficient notwithstanding fact ancient form action declaration disappeared 
first place said consider generally protection given law property within outside limits last named action 
man crosses neighbor boundary however innocent mistake cattle escape neighbor field said liable trespass quare clausum fregit 
auctioneer perfect good faith regular course business sells goods sent rooms purpose sold may compelled pay full value third person turns owner although paid proceeds means obtaining indemnity 
suppose instead dealing plaintiff property case force proceeded directly defendant body plaintiff body urged law less careful persons property subjects defences possible similar would open alleged trespass land 
may show trespass showing defendant act thrown horse upon plaintiff third person took hand struck plaintiff 
cases defendant body file passive instrument external force bodily motion relied plaintiff act 
may show justification excuse conduct plaintiff 
excuse shown defendant voluntarily acted must answer consequences however little intended however unforeseen 
instance assaulted third person defendant lifted stick accidentally hit plaintiff standing behind according view liable irrespective negligence toward party injured 
arguments doctrine consideration part drawn precedent sometimes supposed defensible theoretically sound 
every man said absolute right person forth free detriment hands neighbors 
cases put plaintiff done nothing defendant hand chosen act

must recur conclusions drawn innocent trespasses upon land conversions supposed analogy cases trespasses person lest law concerning latter supposed lie two antinomies necessitating equal cogency opposite conclusion 
take first case trespass upon land attended actual damage 
man goes upon neighbor land thinking intends act consequence complained 
means intermeddle certain thing certain way intended intermeddling sued 
whereas accidentally hits stranger lifts staff self defense fact gist action namely contact staff neighbor head intended could foreseen 
might answered sure intermeddling property intermeddling plaintiff property man sued supposed cases much accidental blow defendant ignorant one facts making total environment must present make action wrong 
ignorant say true owner either claims interest property question therefore intend wrongful act mean deal neighbor property 
answer intend damage complained 
one diminishes value property intentional damage knows belongs somebody 
thinks belongs expects whatever harm may come pocket 
would odd get rid burden discovering belonged neighbor 
different thing say intentionally harm must bear loss saying one whose acts harm follows accidentally consequence could foreseen must bear 
next suppose act complained exercise dominion plaintiff property merely technical trespass conversion 
defendant thought property belonged seems abstract injustice requiring know limits titles thought belonged another holding bound get proof title acting 
consider defendant liability amounts act whether entry upon land conversion chattels unattended damage property thing come back hands true owner

next subjects considered fraud malice intent 
discussion unintentional wrongs greatest difficulty overcome found doctrine man acts always peril 
follows hand difficulty prove actual wickedness kind described several words mentioned element civil wrongs words applied

purposes criminal law however intent alone found important consequences intent malevolence superadded 
pursuing analysis intent found made foresight harm consequence coupled desire bring latter conceived motive act question 
foresight seemed material 
last step foresight reduced lowest term concluded subject exceptions explained general basis criminal liability knowledge time action facts common experience showed certain harmful results likely follow 
remains seen whether similar reduction possible civil side law whether thus fraudulent malicious intentional negligent wrongs brought philosophically continuous series 
word preliminary explanation useful 
shown lecture referred act although always importing intent per se indifferent law 
willed therefore intended coordination muscular contractions 
intent necessarily imported act ends 
muscular motions co ordinations harmless apart concomitant circumstances presence necessarily implied act 
strike fist act whether done desert crowd 
considerations urged show act alone ought impose either civil criminal liability apply least frequently series acts conduct although series shows co ordination intent

sure either case intent beyond co ordination muscles single sound allege certain barrel certain contents intent necessarily shown ordering words 
series acts intent per se indifferent

chief forms liability fraud malice intent said necessary elements deceit slander libel malicious prosecution conspiracy perhaps may added trover 
deceit notion drawn moral world popular sense distinctly imports wickedness 
doctrine common law regard generally stated terms consistent actual guilt actual guilty intent 
said man liable action deceit makes false representation another knowing false intending believe act upon person addressed believes thereby persuaded act harm

party conduct 
consists uttering certain words ordered utterance imports knowledge meaning would convey heard 
conduct knowledge neither moral immoral 
go one step add knowledge another presence within hearing still act determinate character 
elements make immoral knowledge statement false intent shall acted 
principal question whether intent reduced terms cases 
difficulty answer 
perfectly clear intent false representation acted would conclusively established proof defendant knew party intended act upon 
defendant foresaw consequence acts chargeable whether motive desire induce party act simply unwillingness private reasons state truth 
defendant knew present fact party intent according common experience made likely act would harmful consequence chargeable whether fact foresaw consequence 
matter general conclusion follows single instance 
moment admitted one case knowledge present fact party intent act false statement dispenses proof intent induce act upon admitted lesser element necessary larger compound 
intent embraces knowledge sufficing foresight shown 
hence prove intent prove knowledge intent may often easier prove two 
prove knowledge prove intent 
may said however intent implied presumed case supposed 
helping false theory fiction 
much like saying consideration presumed instrument seal merely way reconciling formal theory contracts must consideration manifest fact sealed instruments require one 
whenever said certain thing essential liability conclusively presumed something else always ground suspicion essential clement found something else said presumed

question known circumstances enough throw risk statement upon makes induces another man act turns untrue 
evident man may take risk statement express agreement implied one law reads bargain 
may legal language warrant truth true law treats fraud much makes fully believing knows untrue means deceive 
selling horse seller warranted five years old fact thirteen seller could sued deceit common law although thought horse five 
common law liability truth statements therefore extensive sphere actual moral fraud 
enough general representation made recklessly without knowing whether true false 
recklessly mean 
mean actual personal indifference truth statement 
means data statement far insufficient prudent man could made without leading inference indifferent 
say repeating analysis gone means law applying general objective standard determines man makes statement data liable whatever state mind although individually may perfectly free wickedness making 
hence similar reasoning applied already intent may applied knowledge falsity 
actual knowledge may often easier prove evidence insufficient warrant statement proved contains lesser element 
soon lesser element shown enough shown law ready apply external objective standard also

might actionable rolle c j ruled gilbert v stone 
law goes full length deciding enough defendant chance avoid inflicting harm complained

true liability action necessarily import wrong 
may admitted without impairing force argument foregoing lecture requires people made pay accidents could avoided 
doubtful however whether ruling chief justice rolle would followed 
squib case scott v shepherd language text books less opposed 
latter view law act must general dangerous one would blameworthy part average man order make actor liable 
aside exceptional cases gilbert v stone two tests agree difference need considered follows 
therefore repeat experience test decided whether degree danger attending given conduct certain known circumstances sufficient throw risk upon party pursuing 
instance experience shows good many guns supposed unloaded go hurt people 
ordinarily intelligent prudent member community would foresee possibility danger pointing gun inspected crowd pulling trigger although said unloaded 
hence may properly held man thing peril damage ensues answerable 
co ordinated acts necessary point gun pull trigger intent knowledge shown co ordination acts consistent entire blamelessness 
threaten harm one without facts 
one additional circumstance man line within range piece makes conduct manifestly dangerous one knows fact

sometimes courts induced lay rules facts specific nature legislature passed certain statute case bar within fair meaning words practice specially interested class public large generated rule conduct outside law desirable courts recognize enforce 
matters fact sometimes pleaded 
importance believed induce judges lay rule conduct words rule law suggested tendency instances disappear fast rules suggested become settled 
facts uncertain still motives decision upon law grounds legislation speak judges may ascertain way satisfies conscience 
thus courts recognize statutes jurisdiction judicially although laws jurisdictions doubtful wisdom left jury

many instances found text books show facts ascertained soon cease referred give place rule law

many cases doubt court would lean aid upon jury also many teaching formulated specific rules 
rules found vary considerably regard number concomitant circumstances necessary throw peril conduct otherwise indifferent actor 
circumstances become numerous complex tendency cut knot jury becomes greater 
useful follow line cases simple complicated way illustration 
difficulty distinguishing rules based grounds policy worked field negligence particularly noticed 
cases found voluntary act part person charged 
reason requirement shown foregoing lecture 
unnecessary though defendant intended foreseen evil caused necessary chosen conduct led 
also shown voluntary act enough even co ordinated series acts conduct often enough 
co ordination series acts shows intent necessarily manifested single act sometimes proves almost equal certainty knowledge one concomitant circumstances 
cases conduct intent knowledge thus necessarily implied sufficient throw risk actor 
instance man series acts called walking assumed purposes responsibility knows earth feet 
conduct per se indifferent sure 
man may go motions walking without legal peril chooses practice private treadmill goes motions surface earth doubted knows earth 
knowledge acts peril certain respects 
crosses neighbor boundary trespasser 
reasons strict rule partially discussed last lecture

man walks knows moving surface earth knows surrounded private estates right enter knows motion unless properly guided carry estates 
thus warned burden conduct thrown upon

already suggested knows exercising less dominion property injuring must make good right challenged 
whether strict rule based common grounds liability upon special consideration past present policy policy set limits mentioned foregoing lecture 
another case conduct risk party without knowledge necessarily imports keeping tiger bear animal species commonly known ferocious 
animal escapes damage owner liable simply proof kept 
instance comparative remoteness moment choice line causation effect complained particularly noticed 
ordinary cases liability arise choice proximate cause harm upon action founded 
usually question negligence guarding beast 
enough cases owner chosen keep 
experience shown tigers bears alert find means escape escape certain harm serious nature 
possibility great danger effect probability less one law throws risk venture person introduces peril community 
remoteness opportunity choice goes far show risk thrown upon owner reasons ordinary one imprudent conduct 
suggested liability stood upon remote inadvertence 
law forbid man keep menagerie deem way blameworthy 
applied nearly strict rule dealings even clearly beneficial community show wild beasts 
seems one cases ground liability sought policy coupled tradition rather form blameworthiness existence chance avoid harm man usually allowed 
fact remote inadvertence suggested explanation illustrates said difficulty deciding whether given rule founded special grounds worked within sphere negligence special rule laid 
noticed question defendant knowledge nature tigers although without knowledge said intelligently chosen subject community danger 
even domain knowledge law applies principle averages 
fact tigers bears dangerous generally known man keeps presumed know peculiarities 
words actually know animal certain teeth claws forth must find rest average member community would know peril 
true damages general done ferocious wild beasts true particular class damages done domestic cattle namely trespasses upon another land 
dealt former lectures therefore needless recall call attention distinction based experience policy damage kind expected 
cattle generally stray damage cultivated land get upon 
exceptionally hurt human beings 
need recur possible historical connection either last forms liability noxoe deditio whether origin made policy rule accepted sound carried england within last years doctrine man brings upon land keeps anything likely mischief escape must keep peril 
strictness principle vary different jurisdictions balance varies advantages public dangers individuals conduct question 
danger harm others thing considered said already 
law allows harms intentionally inflicted fortiori risks intentionally run 
western states man required keep cattle fenced 
courts refused follow rylands v fletcher 
hand principle applied artificial reservoirs water cesspools accumulations snow ice upon building reason form roof party walls 
cases ferocious animals excuse defendant know could found weak point dangerous object escaped 
period choice back although blame bound peril know object continual threat neighbors enough throw risk business 
pass cases one degree complex far considered 
must another concomitant circumstance known party addition knowledge necessarily practically proved conduct 
cases naturally suggest concern animals 
experience interpreted english law shown dogs rams bulls general tame mild nature one chance exhibit tendency bite butt gore exceptional phenomenon 
hence law man keeps dogs rams bulls like tame animals peril personal damages may inflict unless knows notice particular animal kept abnormal tendency sometimes show 
law however brought little nearer actual experience statute many jurisdictions 
let us go one step farther still 
man keeps unbroken unruly horse knowing 
enough throw risk behavior 
tendency known wildness dangerous generally particular circumstances 
add keeping attempt break horse still danger public disclosed 
place owner tries break crowded thoroughfare owner knows additional circumstance according common experience makes conduct dangerous therefore must take risk harm may done 
hand man good rider bought horse appearance vice mounted ride home would apparent danger make answerable horse became unruly damage 
experience measured probabilities draws line two cases 
whatever may true explanation rule applied keeping tigers principle rylands v fletcher last cases entered sphere negligence take case lying somewhere two stated add somewhat complexity circumstances shall find conduct standard would probably left without much discrimination jury broad issue whether defendant acted prudent man would done circumstances 
wrongs called malicious intentional necessary mention different classes second time find place series 
seen vary number circumstances must known 
slander conduct generally risk speaker charges kind deals manifestly detrimental questions practically arise part concern defense truth privilege 
deceit requires still simple facts 
statements threaten harm question unless made circumstances naturally lead action made insufficient grounds 
however without significance certain wrongs described language importing intent 
harm cases frequently done intentionally intent cause certain harm shown need prove knowledge facts made harm would follow 
moreover often much easier prove intent directly prove knowledge would make unnecessary 
cases man treated responsible cause given harm one hand extend beyond conduct chosen actual contemplation result therefore may chosen cause harm hand extend instances damages would happened remote election part 
generally speaking choice found extended simple act co ordinated acts conduct 
commonly extended still external consequence 
generally also found stopped short consequence complained 
question case whether actual choice words actually contemplated result near enough remoter result complained throw peril upon actor 
many cases put thus far cases proximate cause loss intended produced defendant 
seen result may caused choice different points 
instance man sued caused neighbor house burn 
simplest case actually intended burn 
length chain physical causes intervening importance bearing case 
choice may stopped one step farther back 
defendant may intended light fire land may intended burn house 
nature intervening concomitant physical causes becomes highest importance 
question degree danger attending contemplated therefore chosen effect defendant conduct circumstances known 
plain great instance conduct consisted lighting stubble near haystack close house manifest circumstances house wood stubble dry wind dangerous quarter court would probably rule liable 
defendant lighted ordinary fire fireplace adjoining house knowledge fireplace unsafely constructed court would probably rule liable 
midway complicated doubtful cases would go jury 
defendant may even intended set fire conduct intent may simply fire gun remoter still walk across room involuntarily upset bottle acid 
cases may go jury reason remoteness choice series events well complexity circumstances attending act conduct 
difference perhaps rather dramatic substantial 
philosophical analysis every wrong begins determining defendant actually chosen say voluntary act conduct consequences actually contemplated flowing goes determine dangers attended either conduct known circumstances contemplated consequence contemplated circumstances 
take case like glancing sir walter tyrrel arrow 
expert marksman contemplated arrow would hit certain person cadit qucoestio 
contemplated would glance direction another person contemplated order judge liability must go end fore sight assuming foreseen event happen consider manifest danger 
event foreseen marksman must judged circumstances known time shooting 
theory torts may summed simply 
two extremes law rules determined policy without reference kind morality 
certain harms man may inflict even wickedly certain others must answer although conduct prudent beneficial community 
main law started intentional wrongs simplest pronounced cases well nearest feeling revenge leads self redress 
thus naturally adopted vocabulary degree tests morals 
law grown even standards continued model upon morality necessarily become external considered actual condition particular defendant whether conduct would wrong fair average member community expected equal peril 
general question determined considering degree danger attending act conduct known circumstances 
danger harm another follow act generally wrong sense law 
cases defendant conduct may morally wrong yet may chosen inflict harm acted fear life 
cases liable according law makes moral blameworthiness within limits explained ground liability deems sufficient defendant reasonable warning danger acting 
distinction however generally unimportant known tendency act known circumstances harm may accepted general test conduct 
tendency given act cause harm given circumstances must determined experience 
experience either first hand voice jury continually working concrete rules form still external still remote reference moral condition defendant even test prudent man makes first stage division law morals 
domain wrongs described intentional systematically styled unintentional negligent 
law thus continually adding specific rules adopt coarse impolitic principle man acts always peril 
contrary concrete rules well general questions addressed jury show defendant must least fair chance avoiding infliction harm becomes answerable consequence conduct 
certainly arguable even fair chance avoid bringing harm pass sufficient throw upon person peril conduct unless judged average standards also blame 
lecture v bailee common law 
far discussion confined general principles liability mode ascertaining point man begins act peril 
matter man whether acts peril unless harm comes must always one within reach consequences act harm done 
furthermore point certain forms harm likely suffered never complained one except person stands particular relation actor person thing

existing theories subject come germany 
german philosophers written upon law known system roman german lawyers philosophized professors roman law

test value principles least prevent hasty assumption universal toward slight tendency among english writers well realize dealing new system philosophy yet taken account

begin time edward ii 
detinue plea plaintiff delivered defendant chest locked key chattels chest taken defendant together goods robbery 
replication goods delivered defendant enclosure fitzherbert says party driven issue implies chest defendant custody liable 
lord holt coggs v bernard denies chest would make difference old books agree delivery goods lock key origin distinction carriers breaking bulk modern criminal law 
reign edward iii case pledge came seems always regarded special bailment keep one goods 
defense goods stolen defendant 
plaintiff driven reply tender theft would put end pledge left defendant general bailee 
issue taken thereon confirms cases implying event defendant would liable 
next take case time henry vi ad

set defense enemies king broke prison carried prisoner defendant 
question whether good defense 
court said alien enemies king instance french released prisoner perhaps burning prison gave chance escape excuse would good defendant remedy one

case court got near original ground liability distinguished accordingly 
person intrusted liable cases remedy wrong doer originally person remedy hand liability founded circumstance ceased remedy ceased 
jailer could sue soldiers invading army frenchmen theory could sue british subject carried prisoner however little likely would get much satisfaction way 
years later law stated way famous littleton 
says goods delivered man shall action trespass carried chargeable 
bound make loss good party intrusted 
edward iv danby says bailee received goods keep proper goods robbery shall excuse otherwise 
later case robbery said excuse 
may hesitation robbery robber unknown bailee remedy even robbery generally ground reason felony bailee could go either robber body estate one hanged forfeited 
shadow doubt bailee excused ordinary wrongful taking

point touched passages year books rule law clearly implied reason given bailee right sue cases cited 
principle directly decided accordance ancient law famous case southcote v bennet 
detinue goods delivered defendant keep safely 
defendant confessed delivery set robbed goods js argument bar gawdy clench ceteris absentibus held plaintiff ought recover special bailment defendant accepted keep proper goods otherwise delivery chargeth keep peril 
plea detinue say robbed one hath remedy trespass appeal 
croke report implies lord coke expressly says kept kept safe one reports agree obligation founded delivery alone 
croke report confirms caution lord coke adds report note reader good policy takes goods keep take special manner scil 
keep keeps goods happen stolen purloined shall answerable accepted ought take like manner otherwise may charged general acceptance 
time least clear law person accepted possession goods keep another even favor lost wrongful taking wholly without fault bound make good loss unless took possession expressly stipulated responsibility 
attempts lord holt coggs v bernard sir william jones book bailments show southcote v bennet sustained authority futile one study year books may see

last important principles seen force late reign queen elizabeth

southcote case decided forty third year queen elizabeth ad 
think first mention carrier pertinent question occurs woodlife case decided four five years earlier eliz ad 
action account merchandise delivered defendant would seem factor pur merchandizer clearly carrier 
plea robbery sea defendant goods 
gawdy one judges decided southcote case thought plea bad popham c j said though would good plea carrier paid carriage difference respect carriers servants factors 
repeated southcote case appears involve double distinction first paid unpaid bailees next bailees servants 
defendant servant control goods might fall within law bailment factors treated footing servants early law 
diversity marked entrance doctrine consideration law bailment 
consideration originally meant quid pro quo explained hereafter 
thus dealt doctor student principle still young 
chief justice popham probably borrowed distinction paid unpaid bailees work common carriers mentioned example former class 
little earlier reward made difference 
woodlife case reply chief justice said gawdy cited case marshal king bench stated whereupon popham fell back old distinction jailer remedy rebels remedy case bar 
cases relied general bailment collected authorities short southcote case founded 
principle adopted southcote case subject question whether defendant fell within 
nothing said custom realm ever reported case time believe first instance carriers way distinguished class persons intrusted goods 
hint special obligation peculiar old books certainly true case introduced one 
noticed reference follows popham speak common carriers carriers 
next came southcote case eliz ad presented old law pure simple irrespective reward modern innovation 
earlier instances loss theft action detinue counting may presume simply delivery wrongful detainer 
time important changes took place procedure usually adopted must explained 
chattel could returned specie detinue afforded satisfaction damage might suffered bailee neglect 
natural remedy damage action case 
could made entirely satisfactory certain difficulties overcome 
neglect occasioned damage might mere omission akin trespass nonfeasance sustain analogy upon trespass case founded moreover charge man acting must show duty act 
pleadings formerly construed would enough allege plaintiff goods damaged defendant negligence 
troubles got well known words super se assumpsit explained later 
assumpsit long time become independent action contract allegation simply inducement action tort 
ground liability defendant started upon undertaking negligent omission let damage could connected acts part dealing thing 
shall find lord holt recognizing original purport assumpsit come coggs v bernard 
course confined cases bailment 
another way besides defendant could charged duty made liable case although less familiar lawyers special bearing law carriers later times 
damage done occasioned act omission defendant pursuit common callings farrier seems action could maintained without laying assumpsit allegation common farrier 
latter principle also wholly independent bailment 
expressed general obligation exercising public common business practice art demand show skill 
fitzherbert says duty every artificer exercise art rightly truly ought 
thus established case would lie damage occasioned omission well caused act defendant reason denying even negligent custody resulted destruction property 
step extend form action cases loss bailee avoid defendant right wage law 
detinue primitive remedy retained mark primitive procedure 
last extension made time southcote case 
form action thus came used alike damage destruction bailee neglect loss wrong doer bailee remedy source opened confusion regard foundation nature defendant duty 
truth two sets duties one peculiar bailees arising assumpsit public calling defendant explained ancient obligation peculiar southcote case example 
obligation bailee might conceived part contract bailment assumpsit become appropriated contract doctrine consideration developed happened lord coke time seemed unnecessary distinguish nicely two sets duties mentioned provided consideration special promise could alleged 
furthermore formerly defendant public calling effect assumpsit purpose charging tort seems thought equally good substitute special promise order charge assumpsit 
rogers v head argument charge one assumpsit must show either public calling time delivery special promise sufficient consideration 
argument assumes bailee received goods course public employment instance common carrier could charged form action breach either sets duties alleging either public calling reward special promise 
seems admitted repeatedly decided since case one common carrier could charged non delivery special action case distinguished assumpsit 
suppose next plaintiff sued case tort 
breach duty complained might damage property always sued form action might loss theft detinue would formerly brought fell bailee reason bailment 
goods stolen bailee liability rested neither common calling assumpsit neglect arose naked facts accepted delivery goods gone cases ought enough allege facts declaration 
natural time honored foundations action case limited application still laid pleadings even scope action enlarged 
shall inquire later whether principles southcote case also extended opposite direction cases falling within 
reasons rule laid lost meaning centuries gawdy clench born owners acquired right sue wrongful taking property hands rule dry precedent likely followed according letter spirit departed 
begun totter reporter cautioned bailees accept terms get rid 
accordingly although decision main authority relied hundred years coggs v bernard whenever peculiar responsibility imposed upon bailees find sometimes assumpsit laid early precedents frequently bailee alleged common bargeman common carrier like without much reference special nature tort question true bearing allegation sometimes lost sight 
first however slight signs confusion language one two cases duty conceived fall within principle southcote case pleaders always allege common public calling held unnecessary 
also adopted devices precedents case strengthen obligation well understand 
chief justice popham sanctioned distinction paid unpaid bailees hence deemed prudent lay reward 
negligence course averred finally became frequent allege obligation law custom realm 
last deserves little attention 
writ register alleging special obligation common carriers custom realm 
writ innkeepers lay duly law custom england easy adopt phrase 
allegation much imply existence special principle state proposition law form usual 
writs trespass allege common law duty way others setting forth statutory obligation 
judges sworn execute justice according law custom england 
duties common carrier far earlier evidence goes simply bailees general coupled liabilities generally attached exercise public calling 
word common addressed latter point shown 
illustrated fact duty thus set forth alleged obligation peculiar common carriers laid custom law common hoymen lightermen c according business party concerned 
noticed chief justice holt coggs v bernard states liability applicable bailees reward exercising public employment mentions common hoymen masters ships alongside embraced common carriers 
also noticed cases time settled formula obligation question set forth case defendant answerable said done omitted particular instance

plea demurred adjudged plaintiff 
writ error brought assigned action lies common bargeman without special promise 
justices barons held well lies common carrier upon land 
follow report seems first glance importance attributed common calling 
loss clearly within principle southcote case required neither special promise common calling application remained unquestioned law three quarters century later court must referred form action employed case liability defendant form action detinue 
objection action lies defendant liable without special promise 
even thus narrowed rather countenances notion allegations necessary charge man damage happening neglect ancient use action also necessary new extension different class wrongs 
pretty clear case would lie nonfeasance notion mistaken shall see denied subsequent decisions 
according hobart report alleged defendant common hoyman carry goods water hire c custom england carriers ought keep goods c lost default servants c resolved though laid custom realm yet indeed common law 
last resolution may mean custom realm common law thing said concerning innkeepers long 
law innkeepers called custom realm writ somewhat air special principle extending beyond law bailment inasmuch liability extended goods within inn custody court may meant make antithesis special principle common law general law bailment governing present case 
whatever doubts croke language might raise standing alone fact remains indisputable nearly century woodlife case liability carriers loss goods whether custom realm defendant common calling alleged placed upon authority intended decided principle southcote case

written admission debt produced court sufficiently identified issuing defendant obviously much better 
weak point writing means identifying defendant difficulty disappeared soon use seals became common

oath secta could always successfully met wager law counter oath part defendant double number fellow swearers produced plaintiff 
writing proved defendant could contradicted 
man said bound bound 
question consideration yet doctrine 
equally bound acknowledged obligation place record superior courts acknowledgment could proved 
indeed day securities taken simply oral admission clerk court noted papers 
advantage writing furnished better proof old cases also made possible enforce obligations would otherwise proof 
said sufficiently explains preference proof writing proof old fashioned witness oath 
equally good reasons latter extended beyond ancient limits 
transaction witnesses losing statutory official character 
already glanvill time usual modes proving debt duel writing 
hundred years later bracton shows secta degenerated retainers household party says oath raises slight presumption 
moreover new mode trial growing although made use cases good must tended diminish estimate set witness oath contrast 
beginning trial jury 
first inquest neighbors likely know disputed matter fact 
spoke knowledge selected officer court instead interested party intended impartial 
soon witnesses summoned old case oath aid inquest find verdict testimony 
advent enlightened procedure secta soon ceased decide case may well asked disappear leave traces 
taking account conservatism english law fact deeds came debts remedy debts proved transaction witnesses would surprise find tender suit persisting cases 
another reason still imperative 
defense debt deed wager law 
section magna charta interpreted prohibit man put law plaintiff statement without good witness 
hence statute required witness secta every case debt plaintiff rely upon writing 
thus happened suit continued tendered cases old defendant admit debt cases always waged law long inquest got much foothold 
establish debt arose merely way promise acknowledgment formerly mode trial provided must writing new form proof introduced law 
rule laid parol party obliged 
old debts conceived raised promise 
duty springing plaintiff receipt property fact could seen sworn 
cases old law maintained even extended little strict analogy 
undertaking surety whatever form clothed really arise fact 
become nature promises soon doubted whether proved evidence 
reign edward iii settled deed necessary except customs particular cities kept old law force 
reign may taken representing time divisions rules procedure established lasted present day 
therefore worth repeat sum condition law time 
still necessary secta tendered every action debt writing produced 
well reasons mentioned sphere actions materially enlarged beyond cases formerly established witness oath 
suretyship longer one became strictly limited cases debt arose receipt quid pro quo 
moreover action contract could maintained without writing 
new species contracts enforced action covenant deed always necessary 
time secta shrunk form although still argued function important contract elsewhere 
could longer examined court 
mere survival transaction witness ceased institution 
hence necessity tendering witness oath fix limit debt upon simple contract except tradition surprising find action slightly extended analogy scope glanvill time 
debt remained substantially point indicated new action available simple contracts introduced century 
mean time inversion explained took place accident procedure become doctrine substantive law 
change easy debts could enforced without deed sprung benefit debtor 
influence roman law doubt aided bringing result 
remembered reign henry ii 
simple contracts debts evidence deed witness left enforced ecclesiastical courts far jurisdiction extended 
perhaps circumstance led glanvill successors apply terminology civilians common law debts 
whether borrowed ecclesiastical courts went directly fountain head certain glanvill makes use classification technical language corpus juris throughout tenth book 
certain special contracts roman system called real bound contractor either return certain thing put hands contractee case lease loan deliver articles kind grain oil money lent 
class correspond except superficial way common law debts 
glanvill adopted nomenclature later writers began draw conclusions 
author fleta writer means always intelligent following adopting predecessors use roman law says raise debt must certain thing promised certain thing promised return 
fleta confined statement debts simple contract might well suggested existing state law 
also required writing seal addition matter given promised return doctrine laid hardly prevailed time 
probably nothing slight vagary reasoning based upon roman elements borrowed bracton 
remains trace gradual appearance consideration decisions 
case reign edward iii 
seems distinguish parol obligation founded voluntary payments obligee one founded payment obligor request 
also speaks debt duty case arising cause payments 
somewhat similar language used next reign 
twelfth year henry iv approach thought money promised man making release makes release good action debt matter 
next reign decided case plaintiff could recover without executed release explained editor ground ex nudo pacto non oritur actio 
important fact edward henry vi 
find case debt recovered unless consideration fact received 
another fact noticed since edward iii 
debts arising transaction without writing said arise contract distinguished debts arising obligation 
hence consideration required required contracts seal whether debts 
henry vi 
quid pro quo became necessity contracts 
third year reign objected au action upon assumpsit building mill shown defendant 
thirty sixth year reign ad doctrine appears full grown assumed familiar 
case turned upon question debated centuries settled whether debt would lie sum money promised defendant plaintiff would marry defendant daughter 
whereas formerly debate whether promise far incident marriage belonged exclusively jurisdiction spiritual courts touched purely mundane doubt whether defendant quid pro quo 
remembered fact formerly sworn transaction witnesses benefit defendant namely delivery things sold money lent 
cases also offer obvious form consideration 
natural question promisor promise 
analysis supposed policy law seen equally satisfied detriment incurred promisee 
therefore unnaturally happened judges first laid law must quid pro quo slow recognize detriment contractee satisfying requirement laid 
case mentioned judges inclined hold getting rid daughter sufficient benefit defendant make debtor money promised even hint opinion marrying lady consideration detriment promisee 
opinion prevailed least time defendant nothing plaintiff raise debt 
held service rendered third person upon defendant request promise reward would enough although without strong opinions contrary time precedents settled 
became established law action debt would lie upon consideration actually received enuring benefit debtor 
however peculiarity either action contract debt led view imperfectly developed theory consideration prevailing reigns henry vi 
elizabeth 
theory assumpsit equity 
wherever consideration mentioned always quid pro quo contractor contract 
moreover consideration ever heard debt time honored remedy every obligation pay money enforced law except liability damages wrong 
shown already surety could sued debt time edward iii

writing general way establishing debt glanvill time witness absurd determine scope action considering single class debts enforced 
moreover writing long time another although conclusive mode proof 
foundation action however proved 
duty duity plaintiff words money due matter one may see reading earlier year books 
hence debt lay equally upon judgment established duty matter record upon defendant admission recorded like manner

first remedy recover money due except liability simply pay damages wrongful act 
closely akin indeed branch action form personal property defendant bound contract otherwise hand plaintiff 
contract pay money question could prove 
contract could proved means known early law constituted debt

third stage reached larger view taken consideration expressed terms detriment promisee

action remain formerly remedy binding contracts pay money far parol contracts concerned could used consideration benefit actually received promisor 
regard obligations arising way remained unchanged 
must devote words effect upon law mode proof mentioned 
mean charters 
charter simply writing

seals came use obviously made evidence charter better far seal difficult forge stroke pen 
seals acquired importance time man bound seal although affixed without consent

exception covenants requirement became rule substantive law also 
man set hand charter bound consented writing prove held force seal deed alone distinguished writings 
maintain integrity inadequate theory seal said consideration 
nowadays sometimes thought philosophical say covenant formal contract survives alongside ordinary consensual contract happened roman law 
instructive way putting either 
one sense everything form law requires order make promise binding mere expression promisor 
consideration form much seal 
difference one form modern introduction foundation good sense least common habits thought notice whereas survival older condition law less manifestly sensible less familiar 
may add influence latter consideration law covenants breaking 
many states held mere scroll flourish pen sufficient seal 
short step abolish distinction sealed unsealed instruments altogether done western states 
covenants survive somewhat weak old age debt disappeared leaving vaguely disturbing influence behind whole modern law contract grown medium action assumpsit must explained 
norman conquest ordinary actions begun writ issuing king ordering defendant summoned court answer plaintiff 
writs issued matter course various well known actions took names 
writs debt covenant writs trespass forcible injuries plaintiff person property possession 
writs issued actions known law without writ court authority try case 
time edward actions 
cases could recover money another fell small number groups particular form suing stating claim 
forms ceased adequate 
thus many cases exactly fall within definition trespass proper remedy furnished 
order furnish remedy first thing done furnish writ 
accordingly famous statute edward c authorized office old writs issued frame new ones cases similar principle writs found requiring like remedy exactly falling within scope writs already use 
thus writs trespass case began make appearance writs stating ground complaint trespass quite amounting trespass sued older precedents 
take instance substantially one earliest cases suppose man left horse blacksmith shod negligently drove nail horse foot 
might owner horse could one old writs horse possession damage done 
strict trespass property could committed person possession 
could committed one possession 
laming horse equally wrong whether owner held horse bridle left smith wrong closely analogous trespass although one law gave owner writ trespass case 
example like raises difficulty much action tort wrong trespass 
contract stated none necessary principle 
belong class cases considered problem us trace origin assumpsit action contract 
assumpsit however began action trespass case thing discovered trespass case ever became available mere breach agreement 
well examine earliest cases undertaking assumpsit alleged 
first reported books reign edward iii 
plaintiff alleged defendant undertook carry plaintiff horse safely across humber surcharged boat reason horse perished 
objected action either covenant breach agreement else trespass 
answered defendant committed wrongful act surcharged boat objection overruled 
case although undertaking stated hardly introduced new principle 
force proceed directly defendant sure brought bear combination overloading pushing stream 
next case reign goes 
writ set forth defendant undertook cure plaintiff horse sickness manucepit equum praedicti w de infirmirate work negligently horse died 
differs case laming horse nail two respects 
charge forcible act indeed act mere omission 
hand states undertaking 
defendant objected action breach undertaking plaintiff brought covenant 
plaintiff replied could without deed action negligently causing death horse tort breach contract 
said defendant might trespass 
plaintiff answered saying horse killed force died per def 
de sa cure upon argument writ adjudged good thorpe j saying seen man indicted killing patient want care default curing undertaken cure 
cases seen dealt court pure actions tort notwithstanding allegation undertaking part defendant 
also seen successively remote ordinary case trespass 
case last stated especially destroying force proceed defendant sense 
thus confronted question possible analogy could found wrongful act producing harm failure act attempt answer let illustrate little examples somewhat later date 
suppose man undertook work upon another house unskilfulness spoiled employer timbers would like trespass although one employer would sue trespass case 
stated clear law one judges reign henry iv 
suppose instead directly spoiling materials carpenter simply left hole roof rain come done damage 
analogy previous case marked step farther away trespass force come defendant 
yet instance also judges thought trespass case would lie 
time henry iv 
action could maintained simple refusal build according agreement suggested court writ mentioned thing commenced done would otherwise 
recur question likeness could omission trespass sufficient warrant writ trespass case order find answer essential notice earlier cases omission occurred course dealing plaintiff person property occasioned damage one 
view fact thorpe reference indictments killing patient want care later distinction neglect task commenced pregnant 
former becomes still suggestive remembered first argument analogy found upon subject 
meaning analogy plain 
although man perfect right stand see neighbor property destroyed matter watch neighbor perish want help yet intermeddles longer freedom 
withdraw 
give specific example surgeon benevolence cuts umbilical cord newly born child stop watch patient bleed death 
would murder wilfully allow death come pass way much intention entertained time cutting cord 
would matter whether wickedness began act subsequent omission 
reasoning applies civil liability 
carpenter need go work upon another man house accepts confidence intermeddles stop leave roof open weather 
case farrier taken charge horse could stop critical moment leave consequences fortune 
still clearly ferryman undertook carry horse across humber although water drowned horse remote acts overloading boat pushing stream condition occasioned loss answerable 
foregoing cases duty independent contract least regarded judges decided stood general rules applied human conduct even criminal law 
immediate occasion damage complained may mere omission letting operation natural forces 
connect connected fact previous dealings course action conduct taken whole caused occasioned harm 
objection may urged sure considerable step holding man liable consequences acts might prevented making answerable interfered course nature neither set motion opened door harm difference making hole roof leaving open cutting cord letting bleed one side case farrier receives sick horse omits proper precautions 
seem two answers 
first clear distinction adverted court decided case mentioned 
alleged defendant performed cure negligently horse died 
might occurred judges defendant conduct possibly went omission series beneficial measures 
probably assumed consisted combination acts neglects taken whole amounted improper dealing thing 
next place doubtful whether distinction sound one practical grounds 
may well long one allows trust reposed bound use precautions known although made contract liberty renounce trust reasonable manner 
view derives support issue parties went trial defendant performed cure well knew without horse died default care cure 
denied allegation undertaking conveyed idea promise well entering upon business hand 
indeed latter element sufficiently conveyed perhaps without 
may asked therefore whether promise count something raising duty act 
far involves consequence action fact breach contract answer given already sustained great weight authority doubted 
bind defendant contract instrument seal essential 
shown already even ancient sphere debt limited requirement time edward iii 
deed necessary even bind surety 
fortiori introduce liability upon promises enforced ancient law 
nevertheless suggestion made early date action case damage negligence omission proper precautions alleging undertaking way inducement fact action contract 
five years action negligence curing horse stated action brought form surgeon alleging undertook cure plaintiff hand negligence hand maimed 
however difference set forth plaintiff hand wounded one tb hence appeared however much bad treatment may aggravated matters maiming properly attributable tb plaintiff action 
may led defendant adopt course felt uncertain whether action tort would lie 
took issue undertaking assuming essential plaintiff case objected writ show place undertaking hence bad show whence inquest summoned speak point 
writ adjudged bad ground seems court sanctioned defendant view 
indeed one judges called action covenant said necessity maintainable without specialty small matter man always clerk hand write deed pur faire especially 
time earlier cases mentioned cited relied evident court prepared go beyond hold action could maintained merits apart technical objection 
another connection seems considered action point view trespass 
whatever questions case may suggest class actions alleged undertaking part defendant continued dealt actions tort long time edward iii 
liability limited damage person property arising defendant entered upon employment 
mainly reasoning drawn law tort afterwards extended seen 
beginning reign henry vi 
probably still law action would lie simple failure keep promise 
several times suggested shown would otherwise omission neglect occurred course performance defendant conduct followed physical damage 
suggestion took striking form early years henry vi case carpenter leaving hole roof put 
courts got far easy go one step farther allow effect omission stage followed similar damage 
difference principle asked years later cases admitted action lie smith undertakes shoe horse reason horse goes lame lawyer undertakes argue case thus inducing rely upon neglects present lose said earlier instances duty dependent accessory covenant action would lie accessory matter would lie principal 
held demurrer action would lie procuring certain releases defendant undertaken get 
five years later another case came like farrier reign edward iii 
alleged defendant undertook cure plaintiff horse applied medicine negligently horse died 
earlier case issue taken assumpsit 
difference omission act clearly stated declaration held mean necessarily anything omission said undertaking defendant would owed duty act 
hence allegation defendant promise material issue could properly taken 
decision distinctly separated mass actions case special class arising promise source defendant obligation matter time class become new distinct action contract 
change taken place doctrine consideration first definitely enunciated time would doubt applied quid pro quo would required undertaking 
notion tort abandoned 
law laid beginning reign henry vii accordance earlier decisions said action would lie failure keep promise negligence defendant entered upon undertaking 
far action exceed true limits tort immaterial whether consideration undertaking 
mistake made supposing cases whether proper torts assumpsit alleged equally founded promise one two erroneous conclusions naturally thought follow 
either assumpsit needed quid pro quo clearly none older precedents cases pure tort else precedents wrong quid pro quo alleged every case

objected debt lie contract parties defendant quid pro quo 
court adopted argument said contract consideration ground action plaintiff might sued assumpsit

elements 
general method pursued analysis contract already explained regard possession 
wherever law gives special rights one imposes special burdens another ground certain special facts true individuals 
cases therefore twofold task 
first determine facts special consequences attached second ascertain consequences 
first main field legal argument 
regard contracts facts always 
may certain person signed sealed delivered writing certain purport 
may made oral promise promisee furnished consideration 
common element contracts might said promise although even promise necessary liability debt formerly understood 
possible discuss covenants consideration formed main topic last lecture take first 
furthermore historical difference consideration debt assumpsit shall confine latter later philosophical form 
said benefit conferred promisee promisor detriment incurred promisee may consideration 
also thought every consideration may reduced case latter sort using word detriment somewhat broad sense 
illustrate general doctrine suppose man desirous cask brandy carried boston cambridge truckman either kindness motive says carry delivered accordingly 
carelessly staves cask would perhaps need allege undertook carry principle according older cases undertaking alleged consideration assumpsit need stated 
ground complaint case would wrong irrespective contract 
complaint carry agreed plaintiff difficulty would truckman bound unless consideration promise 
suppose therefore alleged promised consideration delivery 
would sufficient consideration oldest cases going notion benefit promisor said could trouble benefit 
take side detriment 
delivery necessary condition promisor kindness delivery far detriment promisee clear benefit 
argument fallacy 
clearly delivery would sufficient consideration enable owner declare assumpsit breach duties arose irrespective contract defendant undertaken deal thing 
would sufficient consideration promise involving dealing thing performance instance pay thousand dollars 
law pronounced consideration good bad according nature promise founded upon 
delivery sufficient consideration promise 
argument side leaves sight point time sufficiency consideration determined 
moment consideration furnished 
moment delivery cask detriment strictest sense 
owner cask given present control right keep got return performance delivery necessary mere promise performance 
performance still future 
seen although delivery may consideration necessarily one 
promise carry might made accepted understanding mere matter favor without consideration legally binding 
case detriment delivery would incurred promisee obviously would incurred sole purpose enabling promisor carry agreed 
appears always sufficiently borne mind thing may consideration dealt parties 
popular explanation coggs v bernard delivery consideration promise carry casks safely 
given believe true explanation think lord holt view fifth lecture 
whether offered true serious objection one commonly accepted declaration allege delivery consideration 
caution observed construing terms agreement 
hard see propriety erecting detriment instrument may disclose provide consideration unless parties dealt footing 
many cases promisee may incur detriment without thereby furnishing consideration 
detriment may nothing condition precedent performance promise man promises another pay five hundred dollars breaks leg 
courts however gone far towards obliterating distinction 
acts fair interpretation language would seem contemplated compliance condition treated consideration promise 
counter promises agreement expressly stated matters consideration 
mentioned subject question whether may special explanation doctrine said assignment leasehold voluntary statute elizabeth c assignee comes obligations tenant 
yet assignee incurring detriment may contemplated inducement assignment many cases amounts deduction benefit conferred right way would especially obligation pay rent issues land theory law 
although courts may sometimes gone little far anxiety sustain agreements doubt principle laid thing may consideration dealt parties 
raises question thing must dealt order make consideration 
said consideration must confounded motive 
true must confounded may prevailing chief motive actual fact 
man may promise paint picture five hundred dollars chief motive may desire fame 
consideration may given accepted fact solely purpose making promise binding 
nevertheless essence consideration terms agreement given accepted motive inducement promise 
conversely promise must made accepted conventional motive inducement furnishing consideration 
root whole matter relation reciprocal conventional inducement consideration promise 
good example former branch proposition found massachusetts case 
plaintiff refused let certain wood removed land one made oral bargain given note unless received additional security 
purchaser plaintiff accordingly went defendant defendant put name upon note 
plaintiff thereupon let purchaser carry wood 
according testimony defendant signed without knowing plaintiff alter position way faith signature held story believed consideration 
illustration half rule found cases reward offered something afterwards done person acting ignorance offer 
case reward claimed alleged consideration furnished faith offer 
tendered promise induced furnishing consideration 
promise set conventional motive known alleged consideration performed 
sides relation consideration promise conventional nature relation may illustrated case cask 
suppose truckman willing carry cask owner let carry without bargain knows state mind truckman seeing advantage matter says owner consideration delivering cask letting carry promise carry owner thereupon delivers 
suppose promise would binding 
promise offered terms inducement delivery delivery made terms inducement promise 
may probable delivery would made without promise promise would made gratuitous form accepted upon consideration guess 
delivery need made unless owner chose made term bargain promisor set might happened destroy effect happen 
would seem therefore transaction substance spirit might voluntary obligatory according form words parties chose employ purpose affecting legal consequences 
foregoing principles accepted seen explain doctrine given courts trouble establish 
mean doctrine executed consideration sustain subsequent promise 
said sure consideration sufficient preceded request 
objections view plain 
request nature put reasonably imply person reward express promise although put words promise made time consideration given afterwards 
hand words warrant understanding service paid service gift past gift consideration act promisee induced promise 
source error traced partially least history 
suggestions touching matter made last lecture 
words added 
old cases debt question whether plaintiff showed enough maintain action contract precedent spoken several times raising duty 
thus man granted would bound one hundred shillings pay servant certain day services payments made servant account argued contract precedent parol party obliged far appeared payments made servant head request duty could commence 
debt brought deed pay plaintiff ten marks would take defendant daughter wife objected action covenant answered plaintiff contract precedent gave debt 
first case assumpsit meant adopt long familiar thought 
man went bail friend servant arrested 
afterwards master promised indemnify bail failure sued assumpsit 
held consideration wherefore defendant charged unless master first promised indemnify plaintiff servant bailed master never make request plaintiff servant much head 
perfectly plain sailing means case year books 
report however also states case held subsequent promise consideration plaintiff special instance defendant married defendant cousin binding marriage good cause ensued request defendant 
whether intended establish general principle decided reference peculiar consideration marriage soon interpreted broader sense shown last lecture 
several times adjudged past executed matter sufficient consideration promise later day matter relied done furnished request promisor 
time analyze nature promise second conspicuous element simple contract 
indian contract act section says one person signifies another willingness abstain anything view obtaining assent act abstinence said make proposal b person proposal made signifies assent thereto proposal said accepted 
proposal accepted becomes promise 
according definition scope promises confined conduct part promisor 
meant promisor alone must bear legal burden promise may create would true 
meaning 
definition promise legally binding promise 
seeking legal effects contract possible contents promise law may may enforce 
must therefore consider question possibly promised legal sense secondary consequence promise binding performed 
assurance shall rain morrow third person shall paint picture may well promise one promisee shall receive source one hundred bales cotton promisor pay promisee one hundred dollars 
difference cases degree power possessed promisor event 
none first case 
equally little legal authority make man paint picture although may larger means persuasion 
probably able make sure promisee cotton

conditions seemingly arising contract already made conditions sort 
always case condition promise lies within control promisor 
instance promise pay clothes made customer satisfaction held massachusetts make promisor final judge 
interpreted appears contract promisor satisfaction expressed 
promise pay sees fit promise made contract impose obligation 
promise construed mean clothes paid provided ought satisfy promisor thus make jury arbiter would contract promisor gives control event would subject condition sense present analysis 
conditions contract may contain divided theorists conditions precedent conditions subsequent 
distinction even pronounced great importance

cases plaintiff state condition performed order put defendant answer others left defendant set condition broken

subsequent first stage obligation

duty pay architect satisfied 
contract moment determination whether promisor shall pay longer within control 
hence condition subsequent existence obligation 
hand every condition subsequent precedent incidence burden law 
look law would regarded one scruples anything could without incurring legal consequences obvious main consequence attached law contract greater less possibility pay money

one unless year still running 
left defendant set lapse year would due circumstance order pleading require plaintiff meet possible defences set case unanswerable except denial 
point law calls defendant answer varies different cases 
sometimes would seem governed simply convenience proof requiring party affirmative plead prove 
sometimes seems reference usual course events matters belong defense exceptionally true 
logical distinction would conditions must satisfied promise broken like last discharge liability breach occurred 
slightest possible importance may doubted whether another case like last could found 
much important mark distinction stipulation effect confining promise certain cases condition properly called 
every condition true effect upon promise attached whatever rule pleading may promise truly kept performed nothing condition stipulated act broken would act condition fulfilled 
every clause contract showed promisor promise would condition word would worse useless 
characteristic feature quite different 
condition properly called event happening authorizes person whose favor condition reserved treat contract made avoid commonly said insist parties restored position stood contract made 
condition operates lets outside force destroy existing state things

hence important distinguish stipulations extreme effect interpret extent promise define events applies 
shown condition need insisted must distinguish operation way avoidance peculiar incidental working way interpretation definition common clauses conditions

instance employed clerk b wrongfully dismissed middle quarter

whether insists condition bound 
far condition works simply way definition 
establishes promised act case happened 
besides condition necessary may take choice two courses 
first place may elect avoid contract 
case parties stand contract made done work b understood gratuitous rate compensation fixed recover jury think services reasonably worth 
contract longer determines quid pro quo 
alternative course may stand contract prefers sue b breaking 
case recover part damages pay contract rate done well compensation loss opportunity finish 
points material present discussion two remedies mutually exclusive one supposing contract relied set aside stopping work b breach equally consistent either choice fact nothing matter 
one word added avoid misapprehension 
said done promised case happened meant necessarily entitled compensation done larger amount work 
b promise case supposed pay much quarter services although consideration promise promise perform scope limited case performed fact 
hence could simply wait till end term recover full amount would employment continued 
entitled fact b fault services rendered 
b answer claim perfect 
liable upon promise turn promised pay case happened 
promise employ however liable damages 
one two illustrations useful 
promises deliver b promises accept pay certain goods certain time place 
time comes neither party hand 
neither would liable action according said done promised event happened wit nothing 
might objected done bound ought able sue b since performance readiness perform necessary give right conversely might said b hand considering either b defendant facts would complete defense 
puzzle largely one words 
b true performed promised present stage promised act event ready willing act time 
readiness willingness although necessary performance either promise therefore duty necessary order present case promise action side would apply 
hence although b performed promise performed condition right demanding side 
performance condition purely optional one side brought within scope undertaking performing

fraud may well lead making contract statement outside contract one contained

fraudulent representations outside contract never would seem go anything except motives making

savigny said succession apply possession 
notion possession carry us little way understanding modern theory transfer 
theory depends largely upon notion succession use word quoted savigny accordingly successions subject following lecture 
shall begin explaining theory succession persons deceased done shall pass theory transfer living people shall consider whether relation established two 
former easily shown founded upon fictitious identification deceased successor 
first step discussion well sake shall briefly state evidence touching executor heir devisee 
order understand theory law regard first least scholars agreed necessary consider structure position roman family infancy roman society 
continental jurists long collecting evidence earlier periods roman german law alike unit society family 
twelve tables rome still recognize interest inferior members family family property 
heirs called sui heredes heirs property explained gaius 
paulus says regarded owners certain sense even lifetime father death much receive inheritance obtain full power dealing property 
starting point easy understand succession heirs deceased paterfamilias roman system 
family owner property administered paterfamilias rights remained unaffected death temporary head 
family continued although head died 
probably gradual change paterfamilias came regarded owner instead simple manager family rights nature continuity rights change title 
familia continued heirs left ancestor 
heir succeeded ownership thing separately total hereditas headship family certain rights property incident course took headship right representing family interests subject modifications effected last manager 
aggregate ancestor rights duties use technical phrase total persona sustained easily separated natural personality 
persona aggregate formerly family rights duties originally sustained individual family head 
hence said continued inheritance heir assumed action respect injuries previously committed 
thus roman heir came treated identified ancestor purposes law 
thus clear impossible transfers seek explain accomplished instance 
rights b b could show title could readily maintain fiction person whose title denied 
necessary point study family rights german tribes 
disputed modern executor derives characteristics roman heir 
wills also borrowed rome unknown germans tacitus 
administrators later imitation executors introduced statute cases reason executors wanting 
executor legal title whole testator personal estate generally speaking power alienation 
formerly entitled undistributed residue may fairly conjectured legatee specific chattels represented person testator therefore rights testator would distribution alive

useless object promise sued upon made testator b executor law says purpose b one class cases transfer accomplished help fiction shadows fictions often facts early stage society could hardly invented facts otherwise 
executors administrators afford chief example universal succession english law

personal estate goes land takes another course 
real estate disposed goes heir rules inheritance quite distinct govern distribution chattels 
accordingly question arises whether english heir successor real estate presents analogies roman heres executor 
english heir universal successor 
every parcel land descends separate specific thing 
nevertheless narrower sphere unquestionably represents person ancestor 
different opinions held whether thing true early german law 
dr laband says sohm takes opposite view
