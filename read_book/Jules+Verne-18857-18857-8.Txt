chapter conversation discovery returned dinner ready 
meal devoured worthy relative avidity voracity 
shipboard diet turned interior perfect gulf 
repast danish icelandic nothing excessive hospitality host made us enjoy doubly 
conversation turned upon scientific matters fridriksson asked uncle thought public library 
library sir cried uncle appears collection useless odd volumes beggarly amount empty shelves 
cried fridriksson eight thousand volumes rare valuable works scandinavian language besides new publications copenhagen 
eight thousand volumes dear sir cried uncle 
scattered country professor hardwigg 
studious dear sir though live iceland 
every farmer every laborer every fisherman read write think books instead locked cupboards far sight students distributed widely possible 
books library therefore passed hand hand without returning library shelves perhaps years

discovered wonderful manuscript cried fridriksson 
carried away enthusiasm 
mere supposition 
good sir 
really turn another subject hope leave island without examining mineralogical riches 
well fact rather late 
many learned men 
yes yes still much done cried fridriksson

evening dined baron trampe company mayor reykjavik doctor hyaltalin great medical man iceland 
fridriksson present afterwards sorry hear governor agree matters connected administration island 
unfortunately consequence understand word said dinner kind semiofficial reception 
one thing say uncle never left speaking 
next day labor came end 
worthy host delighted uncle professor hardwigg giving good map iceland important precious document mineralogist

whichsoever way thou goest may fortune follow chapter start meet adventures way weather overcast settled commenced adventurous perilous journey 
neither fear fatiguing heat drenching rain 
fact real tourist weather 
nothing liked better horse exercise pleasure riding unknown country caused early part enterprise particularly agreeable 
began enjoy exhilarating delight traveling life desire gratification liberty 
truth spirits rose rapidly began indifferent appeared terrible journey 
said risk simply take journey curious country climb remarkable mountain worst comes worst descend crater extinct volcano 
could doubt terrible saknussemm done 
existence gallery subterraneous passages leading interior earth idea simply absurd hallucination distempered imagination 
may required cheerfully create difficulty 
left reykjavik came decision 
hans extraordinary guide went first walking steady rapid unvarying step 
two horses luggage followed accord without requiring whip spur 
uncle came behind cutting tolerable figure upon small vigorous animals 
iceland one largest islands europe 
contains thirty thousand square miles surface seventy thousand inhabitants 
geographers divided four parts cross southwest quarter vernacular called sudvestr fjordungr 
hans taking departure reykjavik followed line sea 
took way poor sparse meadows made desperate effort every year show little green 
rarely succeed good show yellow 
rugged summits rocky hills dimly visible edge horizon misty fogs every heavy flakes snow showed conspicuous morning light certain lofty pointed rocks first lost gray low clouds summits clearly visible like jagged reefs rising troublous sea 
every spur rock came arid ground leaving us scarcely room pass 
horses however appeared well acquainted country kind instinct knew best road 
uncle even satisfaction urging forward steed whip spur voice 
utterly useless show signs impatience 
could help smiling see look big little horse long legs touching ground made look like six footed centaur 
good beast good beast would cry

snow tempest impracticable roads rocks icebergs nothing stops 
brave sober safe never makes false step never glides slips path 
dare say river fjord crossed doubt many see enter water without hesitation like amphibious like amphibious animal reach opposite side safety 
must however attempt hurry must allow way undertake say us shall ten leagues day 
may reply worthy guide slightest anxiety sort people go ahead without knowing even 
look hans 
moves little impossible become fatigued 
besides complain weariness could loan horse 
violent attack cramp sort exercise 
arms right legs getting little stiff 
advancing rapid pace 
country reached already nearly desert 
could seen isolated farm solitary bur icelandic house built wood earth fragments lava looking like beggars highway life 
wretched miserable huts excited us pity felt half disposed leave alms every door 
country roads paths nearly unknown vegetation poor slowly reached perfection soon obliterated traces travelers passed place place 
nevertheless division province situated miles capital considered one best cultivated thickly peopled iceland 
must state less known distant parts island traveling fully half danish mile met neither farmer door hut even wandering shepherd wild savage flock 
stray cows sheep seen occasionally 
must expect come upheaved regions districts broken roughened volcanic eruptions subterraneous commotions learn good time 
saw however consulting map avoided good deal rough country following winding desolate shores sea 
reality great volcanic movement island attendant phenomena concentrated interior island horizontal layers strata rocks piled one upon eruptions basaltic origin streams lava given country kind supernatural reputation 
little expect however spectacle awaited us reached peninsula sneffels agglomerations nature ruins form kind terrible chaos 
two hours left city reykjavik reached little town called aoalkirkja principal church 
consists simply houses england germany call hamlet 
hans stopped one half hour 
shared frugal breakfast answered yes uncle questions nature road last asked pass night laconic usual 
gardar one worded reply 
took occasion consult map see gardar found 
looking keenly found small town name borders hvalfjord four miles reykjavik 
pointed uncle made energetic grimace 
four miles twenty two little walk 
make energetic observation guide hans without taking slightest notice went front horses walked ahead imperturbable phlegm always exhibited 
three hours later still traveling apparently interminable sandy prairies compelled go round kollafjord easier shorter cut crossing gulfs 
shortly entered place communal jurisdiction called ejulberg clock would struck twelve icelandic church rich enough possess valuable useful article 
sacred edifices however much like people without watches never miss 
horses allowed take rest refreshment following narrow strip shore high rocks sea took us without halt aoalkirkja brantar another mile saurboer annexia chapel ease situated southern bank hvalfjord

uncle humor wait 
dug heels sides steed made shore

uncle sooth say quite obstinate beast bestrode insisted making desired advance 
attempt followed new refusal part horse quietly shook head 
demonstration rebellion followed volley words stout application whipcord also followed kicks part horse threw head heels upwards tried throw rider

neither ebb flow felt ferry boat danger carried sea dashed upon rocky coast 
favorable moment come six clock evening 
uncle guide two boatmen four horses got awkward flat bottom boat 
accustomed steam ferry boats elbe found long oars boatmen sorry means locomotion 
hour crossing fjord length passage concluded without accident 
half hour later reached gardar

every could see fresh white head slightly melancholy expression countenance peering vapor 
uncle however friendly whole party aware three four little ones shoulders many boxes rest hanging legs 
could speak kept crying saellvertu every possible impossible key 
speak made noise 
concert interrupted announcement supper 
moment worthy guide eider duck hunter came seeing feeding stabling horses consisted letting loose browse stunted green icelandic prairies

welcome said hans 
tranquilly air automaton without expression one kiss another embraced host hostess nineteen children

soon everybody sufficiently warm general dispersion took place retiring respective couches 
hostess offered pull stockings trousers according custom country graciously declined honored left us bed dry fodder 
next day five morning took leave hospitable peasants 
uncle great difficulty making accept sufficient proper remuneration 
hans gave signal start 
scarcely got hundred yards gardar character country changed 
soil began marshy boggy less favorable progress 
right range mountains prolonged indefinitely like great system natural fortifications skirted glacis 
met numerous streams rivulets necessary ford without wetting baggage 
advanced deserted appearance increased yet could see human shadows flitting distance 
sudden turn track brought us within easy reach one specters felt sudden impulse disgust sight swollen head shining skin utterly without hair whose repulsive revolting wounds could seen rags 
unhappy wretches never came forward beg contrary ran away quick however hans able salute universal saellvertu 
spetelsk said 
leper explained uncle 
sound word caused feeling repulsion 
horrible affliction known leprosy almost vanished effects modern science common iceland 
contagious hereditary marriage strictly prohibited unfortunate creatures 
poor lepers tend enliven journey scene inexpressibly sad lonely 
last tufts grassy vegetation appeared die feet 
tree seen except stunted willows big blackberry bushes 
watched falcon soaring gray misty air taking flight towards warmer sunnier regions 
could help feeling sense melancholy come 
sighed native land wished back gretchen 
compelled cross several little fjords last came real gulf 
tide height able go reach hamlet alftanes mile farther 
evening fording alfa heta two rivers rich trout pike compelled pass night deserted house worthy haunted fays scandinavian mythology 
king cold taken residence made us feel presence night 
following day remarkable lack particular incidents 
always damp swampy soil dreary uniformity sad monotonous aspect scenery 
evening accomplished half projected journey slept annexia krosolbt 
whole mile feet nothing lava 
disposition soil called hraun crumbled lava surface instances like ship cables stretched horizontally others coiled heaps immense field lava came neighboring mountains extinct volcanoes whose remains showed

time however us take cursory view phenomena 
go forward speed might 
soon soft swampy soil appeared feet horses every hundred yards came upon one small lakes 
journey westerly direction fact swept round great bay faxa twin white summits sneffels rose clouds distance less five miles 
horses advanced rapidly 
accidents difficulties soil longer checked 
confess fatigue began tell severely upon uncle firm hard first day 
could help admiring excellent professor worthy guide appeared regard rugged expedition mere walk saturday th june six clock evening reached budir small town picturesquely situated shore ocean guide asked money 
uncle settled immediately 
family hans say uncles cousins german offered us hospitality 
exceedingly well received without taking much advantage goodness worthy people liked much rested fatigues journey 
uncle require rest idea anything kind despite fact next day sunday compelled mount steed 
soil affected neighborhood mountains whose granite peered ground like tops old oak 
skirting enormous base mighty volcano 
uncle never took eyes could keep gesticulating looking kind sullen defiance much say giant made mind conquer 
four hours steady traveling horses stopped door presbytery stapi 
chapter reach mount sneffels reykir stapi town consisting thirty huts built large plain lava exposed rays sun reflected volcano 
stretches humble tenements along end little fjord surrounded basaltic wall singular character 
basalt brown rock igneous origin 
assumes regular forms astonish singular appearance 
found nature proceeding geometrically working quite human fashion employed plummet line compass rule 
elsewhere produces grand artistic effects piling huge masses without order connection elsewhere see truncated cones imperfect pyramids odd succession lines wishing give lesson regularity preceding architects early ages erected severe order architecture neither splendors babylon marvels greece ever surpassed 
often heard giant causeway ireland fingal cave one hebrides grand spectacle real basaltic formation never yet come eyes 
stapi gave us idea one wonderful beauty grace 
wall fjord like nearly whole peninsula consisted series vertical columns height thirty feet 
upright pillars stone finest proportions supported archivault horizontal columns formed kind half vaulted roof sea 
certain intervals natural basin eye pleased surprised sight oval openings outward waves came thundering volleys foam 
banks basalt torn fastenings fury waves lay scattered ground like ruins ancient temple ruins eternally young storms ages swept without producing perceptible effect last stage journey 
hans brought us along fidelity intelligence began feel somewhat comfortable reflected accompany us still farther way 
halted house rector small incommodious cabin neither handsome comfortable neighbors saw man act shoeing horse hammer hand leathern apron tied round waist 
happy said eider hunter using national salutation language 
god dag good day replied former excellent danish 
kyrkoherde cried hans turning round introducing uncle 
rector repeated worthy professor appears dear harry worthy man rector work 
speaking words guide intimated kyrkoherde true state case 
good man ceasing occupation gave kind halloo upon tall woman almost giantess came hut 
least six feet high region something considerable 
first impression one horror 
thought come give us icelandic kiss 
however nothing fear even show much inclination receive us house 
room devoted strangers appeared far worst presbytery narrow dirty offensive 
however choice matter 
rector notion practicing usual cordial antique hospitality 
far 
day found deal blacksmith fisherman hunter carpenter anything clergyman 
must said favor caught weekday probably appeared greater advantage sunday 
poor priests receive danish government ridiculously inadequate salary collect one quarter tithe parish sixty marks current l sterling 
hence necessity working live 
truth soon found host count civility among cardinal virtues 
uncle soon became aware kind man deal 
instead worthy learned scholar found dull ill mannered peasant 
therefore resolved start great expedition soon possible 
care fatigue resolved spend days mountains 
preparations departure made next day arrival stapi hans hired three icelanders take place horses could longer carry luggage 
however worthy islanders reached bottom crater go back leave us 
point settled would agree start 
occasion uncle partly confided hans eider duck hunter gave understand intention continue exploration volcano last possible limits 
hans listened calmly nodded head 
go elsewhere bury bowels earth travel summits amused occupied incidents travel begun forget inevitable future destined realize actual state affairs 
done run away really intended leave professor hardwigg fate hamburg foot sneffels 
one idea others began trouble terrible idea one calculated shake nerves man even less sensitive 
let us consider matter said going ascend sneffels mountain 
well good 
pay visit bottom crater 
good still 
others done perish course 
however whole matter considered 
road really present descend dark subterraneous bowels mother earth thrice unhappy saknussemm really told truth shall certainly lost midst labyrinth subterraneous galleries volcano 
evidence prove sneffels really extinct 
proof eruption shortly take place monster slept soundly since follow never wake wake become us questions worth thinking upon reflected long deeply 
could lie search sleep without dreaming eruptions 
thought objected reduced state dross ashes 
could stand longer determined last submit whole case uncle adroit manner possible form totally irreconcilable hypothesis 
sought 
laid fears drew back order let get passion ease 
thinking matter said quietest tone world 
mean last listen voice reason think suspending projects almost much happiness true 
however made remark 
fact anxious interrupt allowed reflect leisure 
moments spoke 
thinking matter resumed 
ever since stapi mind almost solely occupied grave question submitted nothing would unwiser inconsistent act imprudence 
heartily agree dear uncle somewhat hopeful rejoinder 
six hundred years since sneffels spoken though reduced state utter silence may speak 
new volcanic eruptions always preceded perfectly well known phenomena 
closely examined inhabitants region carefully studied soil beg tell emphatically dear harry eruption present 
listened positive affirmations stupefied could say nothing 
see doubt word said uncle follow 
obeyed mechanically 
leaving presbytery professor took road opening basaltic rock led far away sea 
soon open country could give name place covered volcanic deposits 
whole land seemed crushed weight enormous stones trap basalt granite lava volcanic substances 
could see many spouts steam rising air 
white vapors called icelandic language reykir come hot water fountains indicate violence volcanic activity soil 
sight appeared justify apprehension 
therefore surprised mortified uncle thus addressed 
see smoke harry boy yes sir 
well long see thus nothing fear volcano 
careful remember continued professor 
approach eruption spouts vapor redouble activity disappear altogether period volcanic eruption elastic fluids longer necessary tension seek refuge interior crater instead escaping fissures earth 
steam remains normal habitual state energy increase add remark wind replaced heavy atmospheric pressure dead calm may quite sure fear immediate eruption 
enough boy 
science sent forth fiat hear obey 
came back house quite downcast disappointed 
uncle completely defeated scientific arguments 
nevertheless still one hope bottom crater would impossible default gallery tunnel descend deeper despite learned saknussemms world 
passed whole following night nightmare chest unheard miseries tortures found depths earth suddenly launched planetary space form eruptive rock next day june hans calmly awaited us outside presbytery three companions loaded provisions tools instruments 
two iron shod poles two guns two large game bags reserved uncle 
hans man never forgot even minutest precautions added baggage large skin full water addition gourds 
assured us water eight days 
nine clock morning quite ready 
rector huge wife servant never knew stood door see us 
appeared inflict us usual final kiss icelanders 
supreme astonishment adieu took shape formidable bill even counted use pastoral house really truly abominable dirty place ever 
worthy couple cheated robbed us like swiss innkeeper made us feel sum pay splendors hospitality 
uncle however paid without bargaining 
man made mind undertake voyage interior earth man haggle miserable rix dollars 
important matter settled hans gave signal departure moments later left stapi 
chapter ascent mount sneffels huge volcano first stage daring experiment five thousand feet high 
sneffels termination long range volcanic mountains different character system island 
one peculiarities two huge pointed summits 
whence started impossible make real outlines peak gray field sky 
could distinguish vast dome white fell downwards head giant 
commencement great undertaking filled awe 
actually started began believe reality undertaking party formed quite procession 
walked single file preceded hans imperturbable eider duck hunter 
calmly led us narrow paths two persons could possibility walk abreast 
conversation wholly impossible 
opportunity reflect admire awful grandeur scene around 
beyond extraordinary basaltic wall fjord stapi found making way fibrous turf grew scanty vegetation grass residuum ancient vegetation swampy peninsula 
vast mass combustible field yet utterly unexplored would suffice warm iceland whole century 
mighty turf pit measured bottom certain ravines often less seventy feet deep presents eye view successive layers black burned rocky detritus separated thin streaks porous sandstone 
grandeur spectacle undoubted well arid deserted air 
true nephew great professor hardwigg despite preoccupation doleful fears come observed great interest vast collection mineralogical curiosities spread vast museum natural history 
looking back recent studies went thought whole geological history iceland 
extraordinary curious island must made appearance great world waters comparatively recent date 
like coral islands pacific may aught know still rising slow imperceptible degrees 
really case origin attributed one cause continued action subterranean fires 
happy thought 
true away theories sir humphry davy away authority parchment arne saknussemm wonderful pretensions discovery part uncle journey must end smoke 
charmed idea began carefully look 
serious study soil necessary negative confirm hypothesis 
took every item saw began comprehend succession phenomena preceded formation 
iceland absolutely without sedimentary soil composed exclusively volcanic tufa say agglomeration stones rocks porous texture 
long existence volcanoes composed solid body massive trap rock lifted bodily slowly sea action centrifugal force work earth 
internal fires however yet burst bounds flooded exterior cake mother earth hot raging lava 
readers must excuse brief somewhat pedantic geological lecture 
necessary complete understanding follows 
later period world history huge mighty fissure must reasoning analogy dug diagonally southwest northeast island degrees flowed volcanic crust 
great wondrous phenomenon went without violence outpouring enormous seething fused matter ejected bowels earth spread slowly peacefully form vast level plains called mamelons mounds 
epoch rocks called feldspars syenites porphyries appeared 
natural consequence overflow depth island increased 
readily believed enormous quantity elastic fluids piled within center last afforded openings process cooling crust taken place 
length time came despite enormous thickness weight upper crust mechanical forces combustible gases became great actually upheaved weighty back made huge gigantic shafts 
hence volcanoes suddenly arose upper crust next craters burst forth summit new creations 
seen first phenomena connection formation island simply eruptive however shortly succeeded volcanic phenomena 
newly formed openings escaped marvelous mass basaltic stones plain crossing covered 
trampling way heavy rocks dark gray color cooling moulded six sided prisms 
back distance could see number flattened cones formerly many fire vomiting mouths 
basaltic eruption appeased set rest volcano force increased extinct craters gave free passage fiery overflow lava mass cinders pumice stone scattered sides mountain like disheveled hair shoulders bacchante 
nutshell whole history phenomena iceland arose 
take rise fierce action interior fires believe central mass remain state liquid fire white hot simply purely madness 
satisfactorily proved qed insensate folly pretend penetrate interior mighty earth mental lecture delivered proceeding journey good 
quite reassured fate enterprise therefore went like brave soldier mounting bristling battery assault old sneffels 
advanced road became every moment difficult 
soil broken dangerous 
rocks broke gave way feet scrupulously careful order avoid dangerous constant falls 
hans advanced calmly walking salisbury plain sometimes would disappear behind huge blocks stone momentarily lost sight 
little period anxiety shrill whistle tell us look 
occasionally would take head stop pick lumps rock silently pile small heaps order might lose way return 
idea journey undertake 
events precaution good one though utterly useless unnecessary must anticipate 
three hours terrible fatigue walking incessantly brought us foot great mountain 
give notion still undergo 
suddenly however hans cried halt made signs effect summary kind breakfast laid lava us 
uncle simply professor hardwigg eager advance bolted food like greedy clown 
halt refreshment also halt repose 
professor therefore compelled wait good pleasure imperturbable guide give signal departure good hour 
three icelanders taciturn comrade say word went eating drinking quietly soberly 
first real stage began ascend slopes sneffels volcano 
magnificent snowy nightcap began call optical delusion common mountains appeared close hand yet many long weary hours must elapse reached summit 
unheard fatigue must endure stones mountain side held together cement soil bound together roots creeping herbs gave way continually feet went rushing plains like series small avalanches 
certain places sides stupendous mountain angle steep impossible climb upwards compelled get round obstacles best might 
understand alpine climbing comprehend difficulties 
often obliged help along means climbing poles 
must say uncle stuck close possible 
never lost sight many occasions arm supplied firm solid support 
strong wiry apparently insensible fatigue 
another great advantage innate sentiment equilibrium never slipped failed steps 
icelanders though heavily loaded climbed agility mountaineers 
looking every height great volcano sneffels appeared wholly impossible reach summit side events angle inclination speedily change 
fortunately hour unheard fatigues gymnastic exercises would trying acrobat came vast field ice wholly surrounded bottom cone volcano 
natives called tablecloth probably reason dwellers cape good hope call mountain table mountain roads table bay 
mutual surprise found actual flight stone steps wonderfully assisted ascent 
singular flight stairs like everything else volcanic 
formed one torrents stones cast eruptions icelandic name stina 
singular torrent checked descent peculiar shape flanks mountain would swept sea would formed new islands 
served us admirably 
abrupt character slopes momentarily increased remarkable stone steps little less difficult egyptian pyramids one simple natural means enabled proceed 
seven evening day clambered two thousand rough steps found overlooking kind spur projection mountain sort buttress upon conelike crater properly called leaned support 
ocean lay beneath us depth three thousand two hundred feet grand mighty spectacle 
reached region eternal snows 
cold keen searching intense 
wind blew extraordinary violence 
utterly exhausted 
worthy uncle professor saw clearly legs refused service fact utterly exhausted 
despite hot feverish impatience decided sigh upon halt 
called eider duck hunter side 
worthy however shook head 
ofvanfor sole spoken reply 
appears says uncle woebegone look must go higher 
turned hans asked give reason decisive response 
mistour replied guide 
ja mistor yes mistor cried one icelandic guides terrified tone 
first time spoken 
mysterious word signify anxiously inquired 
look said uncle 
looked upon plain saw vast prodigious volume pulverized pumice stone sand dust rising heavens form mighty waterspout 
resembled fearful phenomenon similar character known travelers desert great sahara 
wind driving directly towards side sneffels perched 
opaque veil standing us sun projected deep shadow flanks mountain 
sand spout broke us must infallibly destroyed crushed fearful embraces 
extraordinary phenomenon common wind shakes glaciers sweeps arid plains icelandic tongue called mistor 
hastigt hastigt cried guide 
certainly knew nothing danish thoroughly understood gestures meant quicken us 
guide turned rapidly direction would take us back crater ascending slightly 
followed rapidly despite excessive fatigue 
quarter hour later hans paused enable us look back 
mighty whirlwind sand spreading slope mountain spot proposed halt 
huge stones caught cast air thrown eruption 
happily little direction wind therefore reach danger 
precaution knowledge guide dislocated bodies crushed broken limbs would cast wind like dust unknown meteor 
hans however think prudent pass night bare side cone 
therefore continued journey zigzag direction 
fifteen hundred feet remained accomplished took us least five hours 
turnings windings thoroughfares marches marches turned insignificant distance least three leagues 
never felt misery fatigue exhaustion life 
ready faint hunger cold 
rarefied air time painfully acted upon lungs 
last thought last gasp eleven night region quite dark reached summit mount sneffels awful mood mind despite fatigue descended crater shelter us night paused behold sun rise midnight day lowest declension enjoyed spectacle ghastly pale rays cast upon isle lay sleeping feet longer wondered people traveling way england norway behold magical wondrous spectacle 
chapter shadow scartaris supper eaten ease rapidity everybody best could within hollow crater 
bed hard shelter unsatisfactory situation painful lying open air five thousand feet level sea nevertheless seldom happened sleep well particular night 
even dream 
much effects uncle called wholesome fatigue 
next day awoke rays bright glorious sun nearly frozen keen air 
left granite couch made one party enjoy view magnificent spectacle developed panorama like feet 
stood upon lofty summit mount sneffels southern peak 
thence able obtain view greater part island 
optical delusion common lofty heights raised shores island central portions appeared depressed 
means great flight fancy believe giant picture stretched 
could see deep valleys crossed every direction

many portions cone consisted inferior glaciers 
hans whenever met one obstacles advanced great show precaution sounding soil long iron pole order discover fissures layers deep soft snow 
many doubtful dangerous places became necessary us tied together long rope order one us unfortunate enough slip would supported companions 
connecting link doubtless prudent precaution means unattended danger 
nevertheless despite manifold difficulties descent along slopes guide wholly unacquainted made considerable progress without accident

forut said guide tranquilly 
forward answered uncle seventh heaven delight 
quite ready watches indicated thirteen minutes past one chapter real journey commences real journey commenced 
hitherto courage determination overcome difficulties

taken lessons enough frelser kirk copenhagen art looking lofty eminences without blinking however minutes gazed tremendous even wondrous shaft sufficient glimpse give idea physical conformation 
sides almost perpendicular well presented numerous projections doubtless would assist descent 
sort wild savage staircase without bannister fence 
rope fastened near surface would certainly support weight enable us reach bottom arrived utmost depth loosen thought question importance 
uncle however one men nearly always prepared expedients 
hit upon simple method obviating difficulty 
unrolled cord thick thumb least four hundred feet length 
allowed half go pit catch hitch great block lava stood edge precipice 
done threw second half first 
us could descend catching two cords one hand 
two hundred feet explorer let go one end pull away cord would come falling feet 
order go farther necessary continue operation 
excellent proposition doubt correct one 
going appeared easy enough coming occupied thoughts 
said uncle soon completed important preparation let us see baggage 
must divided three separate parcels us must carry one back 
allude important fragile articles 
worthy ingenious uncle appear consider came denomination 
hans continued take charge tools provisions harry must take possession another third provisions arms 
load rest eatables delicate instruments 
exclaimed clothes mass cord ladders undertake carry go

uncle fond half measures like anything way hesitation 
giving orders hans whole nonfragile articles made one bundle packet firmly solidly fastened simply pitched edge gulf 
heard moaning suddenly displaced air noise falling stones 
uncle leaning abyss followed descent luggage perfectly self satisfied air rise completely disappeared sight

going direct interior earth performance cord recommenced quarter hour later reached depth another two hundred feet 
strong doubts determined geologist would descent studied nature different layers earth around

sure sir quite sure 
consult barometer 
quite true mercury rising gradually instrument long descent taking place stopped precisely twenty nine degrees

curious replace barometer manometer 
barometer fact become useless soon weight air greater calculated level ocean 
said much feared ever increasing pressure may end turn painful inconvenient said 
shall descend slowly lungs gradually accustomed breathe compressed air 
well known aeronauts gone high nearly without air accustom breathe say little much certain shall prefer 
let us lose moment

uncle made remark took one hand ruhmkorff coil apparatus hung round neck put electric current communication worm lantern 
bright light illumined dark gloomy tunnel effect magical hans carried second apparatus also put operation 
ingenious application electricity practical purposes enabled us move along light artificial day amid even flow inflammable combustible gases

wait bit advance farther 
yet discovered nothing onwards boy onwards would far correct appropriate expression said let us slide going inclined plane perfect ease 
compass indicated moving southeasterly direction 
flow lava never turned right left 
inflexibility straight line 
nevertheless surprise found perceptible increase heat 
proved theories humphry davy founded truth found examining thermometer silent astonishment 
two hours departure marked fifty four degrees fahrenheit 
every reason believe descent far horizontal vertical

hans laid provisions lump lava supped keen relish 
one thing however caused us great uneasiness water reserve already half exhausted 
uncle full confidence finding subterranean resources hitherto completely failed 
could help calling uncle attention circumstance 
surprised total absence springs said 
doubtless uneasy point 
certainly enough water last us five days 
quite easy matter continued uncle 
answer shall find plenty water fact far shall want 
get crust lava 
expect springs force way solid stone walls prove concrete mass lava extend center earth think yet done much vertical way 
puts head boy asked uncle mildly 
well appears descended far level sea find rather hotter 
according system said uncle thermometer say scarcely fifteen degrees reaumur increase nine since departure 
well conclusion bring inquired professor 
deduction draw simple 
according exact observations augmentation temperature interior earth one degree every hundred feet 
certain local causes may considerably modify figure 
thus yakoust siberia remarked heat increases degree every thirty six feet 
difference evidently depends conductibility certain rocks 
neighborhood extinct volcano remarked elevation temperature one degree every five twenty feet 
let us go upon calculation favorable calculate 
calculate away boy 
nothing easier said pulling notebook pencil 
nine times one hundred twenty five feet make depth eleven hundred twenty five feet 
archimedes could spoken geometrically 
well well according observations least ten thousand feet level sea 
possible either calculation correct truth figures

contended heroically terrible tortures endured wish compel uncle halt 
knew would last fatal stroke 
suddenly felt deadly faintness come 
eyes could longer see knees shook 
gave one despairing cry fell help help dying uncle turned slowly retraced steps 
looked folded arms allowed one sentence escape hollow accents lips 
last thing saw face fearfully distorted pain sorrow eyes closed 
opened saw companions lying near motionless wrapped huge traveling rugs 
asleep dead sleep wholly question 
fainting fit wakeful lark 
suffered much sleep visit eyelids thought sick unto death dying 
last words spoken uncle seemed buzzing ears probable right 
state prostration reduced madness think ever seeing light day 
miles upon miles earth crust 
thought could fancy whole weight resting shoulders 
crushed annihilated exhausted vain attempts turn granite bed 
hours upon hours passed away 
profound terrible silence reigned around us silence tomb 
nothing could make heard gigantic walls granite 
thought stupendous 
presently despite apathy despite kind deadly calm cast something aroused 
slight peculiar noise 
watching intently observed tunnel becoming dark 
gazing dim light remained thought saw icelander taking departure lamp hand 
acted thus hans guide mean abandon us uncle lay fast asleep dead 
tried cry arouse 
voice feebly issuing parched fevered lips found echo fearful place 
throat dry tongue stuck roof mouth 
obscurity time become intense last even faint sound guide footsteps lost blank distance 
soul seemed filled anguish death appeared welcome let come quickly 
hans leaving us cried 
hans hans man come back 
words spoken 
could heard aloud 
nevertheless first moments terror ashamed suspicions man hitherto behaved admirably 
nothing conduct character justified suspicion 
moreover moment reflection reassured 
departure could flight 
instead ascending gallery going deeper gulf 
bad design way would upwards 
reasoning calmed little began hope good peaceful imperturbable hans would certainly arisen sleep without serious grave motive 
bent voyage discovery deep still silence night last heard sweet murmur anxious chapter water bitter disappointment long long weary hour crossed wildly delirious brain sorts reasons could aroused quiet faithful guide 
absurd ridiculous ideas passed head impossible 
believe either half wholly mad 
suddenly however arose depths earth voice comfort 
sound footsteps hans returning 
presently uncertain light began shine upon walls passage came view far sloping tunnel 
length hans appeared 
approached uncle placed hand upon shoulder gently awakened 
uncle soon saw instantly arose 
well exclaimed professor 
vatten said hunter 
know single word danish language yet sort mysterious instinct understood guide said 
water water cried wild frantic tone clapping hands gesticulating like madman 
water murmured uncle voice deep emotion gratitude 
hvar nedat 

understood every word 
caught hunter hands shook heartily looked perfect calmness 
preparations departure take long soon making rapid descent tunnel 
hour later advanced thousand yards descended two thousand feet 
moment heard accustomed well known sound running along floors granite rock kind dull sullen roar like distant waterfall 
first half hour advance finding discovered spring feelings intense suffering appeared return 
began lose hope 
uncle however observing downhearted becoming took conversation 
hans right exclaimed enthusiastically dull roaring torrent 
torrent cried delighted even hearing welcome words 
slightest doubt replied subterranean river flowing beside us 
made reply hastened animated hope 
began even feel deep fatigue hitherto overpowered 
sound glorious murmuring water already refreshed 
could hear increasing volume every moment 
torrent long time could heard flowing heads ran distinctly along left wall roaring rushing spluttering still falling 
several times passed hand across rock hoping find trace humidity slightest percolation 
alas vain 
half hour passed weary toil 
advanced 
became evident hunter absence able carry researches farther 
guided instinct peculiar dwellers mountain regions water finders smelt living spring rock 
still seen precious liquid 
neither quenched thirst brought us one drop gourd 
moreover soon made disastrous discovery progress continued soon moving away torrent sound gradually diminished 
turned back 
hans halted precise spot sound torrent appeared nearest 
could bear suspense suffering longer seated wall behind could hear water seething effervescing two feet away 
solid wall granite still separated us hans looked keenly strange enough thought saw smile imperturbable face 
rose stone seated took lamp 
could help rising following 
moved slowly along firm solid granite wall 
watched mingled curiosity eagerness 
presently halted placed ear dry stone moving slowly along listening extreme care attention 
understood searching exact spot torrent roar plainly heard 
point soon found lateral wall left side three feet level tunnel floor 
state intense excitement 
scarcely dared believe eider duck hunter 
however impossible moment understand applaud even smother embraces saw raise heavy crowbar commence attack upon rock 
saved cried 
yes cried uncle even excited delighted hans quite right 
oh worthy excellent man never thought idea 
nobody else think would done 
process simple seemed would certainly entered heads 
nothing could dangerous begin work pickaxes particular part globe 
supposing work break take place supposing torrent gained inch take ell come pouring bodily broken rock one dangers chimerical 
real 
moment fear falling roof even inundation capable stopping us 
thirst intense quench would dug bed old ocean 
hans went quietly work work neither uncle would undertaken price 
impatience great begun pickax crowbar rock would soon split hundred fragments 
guide contrary calm ready moderate wore away hard rock little steady blows instrument making attempt larger hole six inches 
stood heard thought heard roar torrent momentarily increasing loudness times almost felt pleasant sensation water upon parched lips 
end appeared age hans made hole enabled crowbar enter two feet solid rock 
work exactly hour 
appeared dozen 
getting wild impatience 
uncle began think using violent measures 
greatest difficulty checking 
indeed got hold crowbar loud welcome hiss heard 
stream rather jet water burst wall came force hit opposite side hans guide half upset shock scarcely able keep cry pain grief 
understood meaning plunging hands sparkling jet gave wild frantic cry 
water scalding hot boiling cried bitter disappointment 
well never mind said uncle soon get cool 
tunnel began filled clouds vapor small stream ran away interior earth 
short time sufficiently cool drink 
swallowed huge mouthfuls 
oh exalted delight rich incomparable luxury water whence come us simple fact water though still tingle warmth brought back heart life must surely faded away 
drank greedily almost without tasting 
however almost quenched ravenous thirst made discovery 
chalybeate water excellent stomachic replied uncle highly mineralized 
journey worth twenty spa 
good replied 
think 
water found six miles ground 
peculiarly inky flavor means disagreeable 
hans may congratulate made rare discovery 
say nephew according usual custom travelers name stream good said name hansbach hans brook agreed upon 
hans bit proud hearing determination 
taken small modicum welcome refreshment seated corner usual imperturbable gravity 
said worth letting water run waste 
use replied uncle source river rises inexhaustible 
never mind continued let us fill goatskin gourds try stop opening 
advice hesitation followed attempted followed 
hans picked broken pieces granite knocked using tow happened tried shut fissure made wall 
scald hands 
pressure great attempts utter failures 
evident remarked upper surface springs situated great height may fairly infer great pressure jet 
means doubtful replied uncle column water thirty two thousand feet high atmospheric pressure must something enormous 
new idea struck 
much trouble close aperture hesitated stammered real reason 
water bottles empty sure shall able fill observed uncle 
think probable 
well let water run 
course naturally follow track serve guide refresh us 
think idea good one cried reply rivulet companion reason succeed marvelous project 
ah boy said professor laughing coming round 
confident ultimate success 
one moment nephew mine 
let us begin taking hours repose 
utterly forgotten night 
chronometer however informed fact 
soon sufficiently restored refreshed fallen profound sleep 
chapter ocean next day nearly forgotten past sufferings 
first sensation experienced surprise thirsty actually asked reason 
running stream flowed rippling wavelets feet satisfactory reply 
breakfasted good appetite drank fill excellent water 
felt quite new man ready go anywhere uncle chose lead 
began think 
man seriously convinced uncle succeed excellent guide worthy hans devoted nephew brilliant ideas invaded brain 
proposition made go back summit mount sneffels declined offer indignant manner 
fortunately question going 
descend farther interior earth 
let us moving cried awakening echoes old world 
resumed march thursday eight clock morning 
great granite tunnel went round sinuous winding ways presented every sharp turns fact appearance labyrinth 
direction however general towards southwest 
uncle made several pauses order consult compass 
gallery began trend downwards horizontal direction two inches fall every furlong 
murmuring stream flowed quietly feet 
could compare familiar spirit guiding us earth dabbled fingers tepid water sang like naiad progressed 
good humor began assume mythological character 
uncle began complain horizontal character road 
route found began indefinitely prolonged instead sliding celestial ray according expression 
choice long road led towards center however little progress made reason complain 
moreover time time slopes much greater naiad sang loudly began dip downwards earnest 
yet however felt painful sensation 
got excitement discovery water 
day next considerable amount horizontal relatively little vertical traveling 
friday evening tenth july according estimation ought thirty leagues southeast reykjavik two leagues half deep 
received rather startling surprise 
feet opened horrible well 
uncle delighted actually clapped hands saw steep sharp descent 
ah ah cried rapturous delight take us long way 
look projections rock 
hah exclaimed fearful staircase hans however troubles never given ropes took care dispose prevent accidents 
descent began 
dare call perilous descent already familiar sort work look upon anything ordinary affair 
well kind narrow opening massive granite kind known fissure 
contraction terrestrial scaffolding suddenly cooled evidently cause 
ever served former times kind funnel passed eruptive masses vomited sneffels loss explain left mark 
fact descending spiral something like winding staircases use modern houses 
compelled every quarter hour thereabouts sit order rest legs 
calves ached 
seated projecting rock legs hanging gossiped ate mouthful drinking still pleasantly warm running stream deserted us 
scarcely necessary say curiously shaped fissure hansbach become cascade detriment size 
still however sufficient wants 
besides knew soon declivity ceased abrupt stream must resume peaceful course 
moment reminded uncle impatience rage flowed peacefully pictured placidity icelandic guide 
whole two days sixth seventh july followed extraordinary spiral staircase fissure penetrating two leagues farther crust earth put us five leagues level sea 
eighth however twelve clock day fissure suddenly assumed much gentle slope still trending southeast direction 
road became comparatively easy time dreadfully monotonous 
would difficult matters turned otherwise 
peculiar journey chance diversified landscape scenery 
events idea 
length wednesday fifteenth actually seven leagues twenty one miles surface earth fifty leagues distant mountain sneffels 
though truth told tired health resisted suffering satisfactory state 
traveler box medicaments even opened 
uncle careful note every hour indications compass manometer thermometer afterwards published elaborate philosophical scientific account remarkable voyage 
therefore able give exact relation situation 
therefore informed fifty leagues horizontal direction distant starting point could suppress loud exclamation 
matter cried uncle 
nothing important idea entered head reply 
well boy 
opinion calculations correct longer iceland 
think easily find replied pulling map compasses 
see said careful measurement mistaken 
far beyond cape portland fifty leagues southeast take us open sea 
open sea cried uncle rubbing hands delighted air 
yes cried doubt old ocean flows heads well dear boy natural know neighborhood newcastle coal mines worked far sea worthy uncle professor doubt regarded discovery simple fact idea means pleasant one 
yet one came think matter seriously mattered whether plains mountains iceland suspended devoted heads mighty billows atlantic ocean whole question rested solidity granite roof us 
however soon got used ideal passage level running still always southeast kept going deeper deeper profound abysses mother earth 
three days later eighteenth day july saturday reached kind vast grotto 
uncle paid hans usual rix dollars decided next day day rest 
chapter sunday ground awoke sunday morning without sense hurry bustle attendant immediate departure 
though day devoted repose reflection spent strange circumstances wonderful place idea pleasant one 
besides began get used kind existence 
almost ceased think sun moon stars trees houses towns fact terrestrial necessities 
peculiar position far reflections 
grotto vast magnificent hall 
along granitic soil stream flowed placidly pleasantly 
great distance fiery source water scarcely lukewarm could drunk without delay difficulty 
frugal breakfast professor made mind devote hours putting notes calculations order 
first place said good many verify prove order may know exact position 
wish able return upper regions make map journey kind vertical section globe profile expedition 
would indeed curious work uncle make observations anything like certainty precision 
never occasion failed note great care angles slopes 
certain made mistake 
take compass examine points 
looked instrument care 
east one quarter southeast 
good resumed professor noting observation going rapid calculations 
make journeyed two hundred fifty miles point departure 
mighty waves atlantic rolling heads certainly

whales playing shoals thrashing bottom sea roof adamantine prison quite rest point danger breaking 
return calculations

sixteen leagues fifty miles cried 
sure 
extreme limit allowed science thickness earth crust replied referring geological studies 
contravene assertion quiet answer 
stage journey according known laws increase heat temperature fifteen hundred degrees reaumur 
say boy 
case granite would exist state fusion 
perceive boy facts usual stubborn things overruling theories 
forced yield evidence senses nevertheless much surprised 
heat thermometer really indicate continued philosopher 
twenty seven six tenths

far willing allow chimney extinct volcano covered lava kind refractory heat fact bad conductor allow great increase temperature percolate sides 
hot water jet supported view matter 
without entering long useless discussion seeking new arguments controvert uncle contented taking facts 
well sir take granted calculations correct allow draw rigorous definite conclusion 
go boy say cried uncle goodhumoredly 
place latitude iceland terrestrial depth fifteen hundred eighty three leagues 
fifteen hundred eighty three quarter 
well suppose say sixteen hundred round numbers 
voyage sixteen hundred leagues completed sixteen 
say expense diagonal journey less eighty five leagues 
exactly 
twenty days 
exactly twenty days 
sixteen hundredth part contemplated expedition 
go way shall two thousand days five years half going 
professor folded arms listened speak 
without counting vertical descent sixteen leagues costs us horizontal eighty five shall go eight thousand leagues southeast must therefore come somewhere circumference long hope reach center 
bother calculations cried uncle one old rages 
basis rest know passage take us direct end require moreover favor fortunately precedent 
undertaken another done succeeded equally successful hope indeed still suppose may allowed allowed hold tongue cried professor hardwigg talk unreasonably 
saw old doctorial professor still alive uncle fearful rouse angry passions dropped unpleasant subject 
explained consult manometer 
indicate considerable amount pressure 
good 
see descending slowly gradually accustoming density lower atmosphere shall suffer 
well suppose except may certain amount pain ears rather grim reply 
dear boy nothing easily get rid source discomfort bringing exterior air communication air contained lungs 
perfectly said quite made mind wise contradict uncle 
fancy almost experience certain amount satisfaction making plunge dense atmosphere 
taken note wonderfully sound propagated course 
doubt journey interior earth would excellent cure deafness 
uncle ventured mildly observe density continue increase 
yes according law however scarcely defined 
true intensity weight diminish proportion depth go 
know well surface earth action powerfully felt contrary center earth bodies cease weight 
know case progress atmosphere finally assume density water know placed pressure seven hundred ten atmospheres cried uncle imperturbable gravity 
still lower asked natural anxiety 
well lower density become even greater 
shall able make way atmospheric fog well worthy nephew must ballast filling pockets stones said professor hardwigg 
faith uncle answer everything reply 
began feel unwise go farther wide field hypotheses certainly revived difficulty rather impossibility would enraged professor 
evident nevertheless air pressure might multiplied thousands atmospheres would end becoming perfectly solid admitting bodies resisted pressure stop spite reasonings world 
facts overcome arguments 
thought best urge argument 
uncle would simply quoted example saknussemm 
supposing learned icelander journey ever really taken place one simple answer made sixteenth century neither barometer manometer invented could saknussemm able discover reach center earth unanswerable learned objection however kept bracing courage awaited course events little aware adventurous yet incidents remarkable journey 
rest day leisure repose spent calculation conversation 
made point agree professor everything envied perfect indifference hans without taking trouble cause effect went blindly onwards wherever destiny chose lead 
chapter alone must truth confessed things yet gone well acted bad taste complained 
true medium difficulties increase within range possibility might ultimately reach end journey 
glory would began newly aroused ardor soul speak enthusiastically professor 
well serious whole state existed mystery impossible know whether earnest 
several days memorable halt slopes became rapid even frightful character almost vertical forever going solid interior mass 
days actually descended league half even two leagues towards center earth 
descents sufficiently perilous engaged learned fully appreciate marvelous coolness guide hans 
without wholly lost 
grave impassible icelander devoted us incomprehensible sang froid ease thanks many dangerous pass got inevitably stuck fast 
silence increased every day

memory even makes soul shudder blood run cold 
seventh august 
constant successive descents taken us quite thirty leagues interior earth say us thirty leagues nearly hundred miles rocks oceans continents towns say nothing living inhabitants

word forlorad distinctly reached ear

new wonders awaited us every step 
gone many hundred yards came upon mighty group trees discolored leaves common humble trees mother earth exorbitant phenomenal size lycopods hundred feet high flowering ferns tall pines gigantic grasses astonishing magnificent splendid cried uncle us whole flora second period world transition 
behold humble plants gardens first ages world mighty trees 
look around dear harry 
botanist ever gazed sight uncle enthusiasm always little required excusable 
right uncle remarked 
providence appears designed preservation vast mysterious hothouse antediluvian plants prove sagacity learned men figuring marvelously paper 
well said boy well said indeed mighty hothouse 
would also within bounds reason common sense added also vast menagerie 
looked rather anxiously around 
animals exaggerated plants matter would certainly serious 
menagerie doubtless 
look dust treading foot behold bones whole soil seashore covered bones replied yes certainly bones antediluvian animals 
stooped spoke picked one two singular remains relics bygone age 
easy give name gigantic bones instances big trunks trees 
clearly lower jawbone mastodon cried almost warmly enthusiastically uncle molars dinotherium leg bone belonged megatherium 
right uncle indeed menagerie mighty animals bones belonged lived died shores subterranean sea shadow plants 
look yonder whole skeletons yet yet nephew said uncle noticing suddenly came full stop 
understand presence beasts granite caverns however vast prodigious reply 
said uncle much old professional impatience 
well known animal life existed earth secondary period sedimentary soil formed alluviums thus replaced hot burning rocks primitive age 
listened earnestly patience harry simple clear answer objections sedimentary soil 
enormous depth surface earth fact explained simply geologically 
certain period earth consisted elastic crust liable alternative upward downward movements virtue law attraction

hitherto discovered probabilities rather ever observed professor 
losing skepticism presence wonders 
well determined solve question

well replied professor examining situation one point view distant three hundred fifty leagues iceland 
much exclamation 
gone matter several times sure made mistake five hundred yards replied uncle positively 
direction still going southeast yes western declination nineteen degrees forty two minutes 
inclination discovered curious fact 
declination variation needle true meridian place 
inclination dip magnetic needle tendency incline towards earth 
may uncle information interests 
needle instead dipping towards pole earth northern hemisphere upward tendency 
proves cried great point magnetic attraction lies somewhere surface earth spot succeeded reaching 
exactly observant nephew exclaimed uncle elated delighted quite probable succeed getting toward polar regions somewhere near seventy third degree latitude sir james ross discovered magnetic pole shall behold needle point directly upward 
therefore discovered analogy great center attraction situated great depth 
well said rather surprised discovery astonish experimental philosophers 
never suspected 
science great mighty end unerring replied uncle dogmatically science fallen many errors errors fortunate useful rather otherwise steppingstones truth 
discussion turned another matter

dear boy time discussion

looked around surprise incredulity 
could see nothing shape boat vessel 
cried launch upon unknown sea may ask vessel carry us well dear boy exactly would call vessel 
present must content good solid raft 
raft cried incredulously raft impossible construction vessel loss imagine good harry listen instead talking much would hear said uncle waxing little impatient 
hear yes certain knocks hammer hans employing make raft 
work many hours 
making raft yes 
found trees suitable construction found trees ready hand

good 
glad see remember well 
let us start point let us count four days storm rate traveling must great 
say velocity must eighty leagues twenty four hours

three hundred leagues added grand total 
yes central sea must extend least six hundred leagues side side

yes harry boy certainly something providential wandering mercy wind waves towards south come back exactly north better still fall upon great discovery cape saknussemm
