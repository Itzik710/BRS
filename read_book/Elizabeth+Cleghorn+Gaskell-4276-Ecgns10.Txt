ask mrs thornton tell us good doctor 
throw away money one first rate 
stay turn street 
street look could contain house large enough mrs thornton habitation 
son presence never gave impression kind house lived unconsciously margaret imagined tall massive handsomely dressed mrs thornton must live house character 
marlborough street consisted long rows small houses blank wall least could see point entered 
told lived marlborough street sure said mr hale much perplexed air 
perhaps one economies still practises live small house 
plenty people let ask 
accordingly inquired passer informed mr thornton lived close mill factory lodge door pointed end long dead wall noticed 
lodge door like common garden door one side great closed gates ingress egress lurries wagons 
lodge keeper admitted great oblong yard one side offices transaction business opposite immense many windowed mill whence proceeded continual clank machinery long groaning roar steam engine enough deafen lived within enclosure 
opposite wall along street ran one narrow sides oblong handsome stone coped house blackened sure smoke paint windows steps kept scrupulously clean 
evidently house built fifty sixty years 
stone facings long narrow windows number flights steps front door ascending either side guarded railing witnessed age 
margaret wondered people could afford live good house keep perfect order prefer much smaller dwelling country even suburb continual whirl din factory 
unaccustomed ears could hardly catch father voice stood steps awaiting opening door 
yard great doors dead wall boundary dismal look sitting rooms house margaret found mounted old fashioned stairs ushered drawing room three windows went front door room right hand side entrance

window curtains lace chair sofa particular veil netting knitting 
great alabaster groups occupied every flat surface safe dust glass shades 
middle room right bagged chandelier large circular table smartly bound books arranged regular intervals round circumference polished surface like gaily colored spokes wheel 
everything reflected light nothing absorbed 
whole room painfully spotted spangled speckled look impressed margaret unpleasantly hardly conscious peculiar cleanliness required keep everything white pure atmosphere trouble must willingly expended secure effect icy snowy discomfort 
wherever looked evidence care labor care labor procure ease help habits tranquil home employment solely ornament preserve ornament dirt destruction

talking world might hear common effect room make people speak low unwilling awaken unused echoes 
last mrs thornton came rustling handsome black silk wont muslins laces rivalling excelling pure whiteness muslins netting room 
margaret explained mother could accompany return mrs thornton call anxiety bring back father fears vividly gave bungling account left impression mrs thornton mind mrs hale temporary fanciful fine ladyish indisposition might put aside strong enough motive severe allow come day call might deferred 
remembering horses carriage hired visit hales fanny ordered go mr thornton order pay every respect mrs thornton drew slightly offended gave margaret sympathy indeed hardly credit statement mother indisposition

give servants reasons expenditure economy use money owners capital right choose 
human right said margaret low

try pleaded thoughts suddenly bent upon learning said 
displeased pertinacity choose affix much importance words 
said human right 
meant seemed reason religious ones like 
know differ religious opinions give credit though speaking subdued voice alone 
wish exclusively addressed 
replied usual tone think occasion consider special religious opinions affair 
meant say human law prevent employers utterly wasting throwing away money choose passages bible would rather imply least neglected duty stewards 
however know little strikes rate wages capital labor better talk political economist like 
nay reason said eagerly 
shall glad explain may seem anomalous mysterious stranger especially time like doings sure canvassed every scribbler hold pen 
thank answered coldly 
course shall apply father first instance information give get puzzled living amongst strange society 
think strange 
know suppose face see two classes dependent every possible way yet evidently regarding interests opposed never lived place two sets people always running 
heard running masters ask heard abusing men see persist misunderstanding said day 
heard abusing masters margaret reddened smiled said fond catechised 
refuse answer question 
besides nothing fact 
must take word heard people may someone workpeople speak though interest employers keep acquiring money would make independent sum savings bank 
dare say man higgins told said mrs hale 
mr thornton appear hear margaret evidently wish know 
caught nevertheless 
heard moreover considered advantage masters ignorant workmen hedge lawyers captain lennox used call men company questioned would know reason every order 
latter part sentence addressed rather father mr thornton 
captain lennox asked mr thornton strange kind displeasure prevented moment replying father took conversation 
never fond schools margaret would seen known much done education milton 
said sudden meekness 
know care enough schools 
knowledge ignorance speaking relate reading writing teaching information one give child 
sure meant ignorance wisdom shall guide men women 
hardly know 
informant spoke masters would like hands merely tall large children living present moment blind unreasoning kind obedience 
short miss hale evident informant found pretty ready listener slander chose utter masters said mr thornton offended tone 
margaret reply 
displeased personal character mr thornton affixed said 
mr hale spoke next must confess although become intimately acquainted workmen margaret much struck antagonism employer employed surface things 
even gather impression time time said 
mr thornton paused awhile spoke 
margaret left room vexed state feeling 
however little annoyance making cooler thoughtful gave greater dignity said theory interests identical workpeople vice versa 
miss hale know like hear men called hands use word though comes readily lips technical term whose origin whatever dates time 
future day millennium utopia unity may brought practice fancy republic perfect form government 
read plato republic soon finished homer 
well platonic year may fall men women children fit republic give constitutional monarchy present state morals intelligence 
infancy require wise despotism govern us 
indeed long past infancy children young people happiest unfailing laws discreet firm authority 
agree miss hale far consider people condition children deny masters anything making keeping 
maintain despotism best kind government hours come contact must necessarily autocrat 
use best discretion humbug philanthropic feeling rather much north make wise laws come decisions conduct business laws decisions work good first instance second neither forced give reasons flinch declared resolution 
let turn shall suffer well end find bated altered one jot 
margaret entered room sitting work speak 
mr hale answered dare say talking great ignorance little know say masses already passing rapidly troublesome stage intervenes childhood manhood life multitude well individual 
error many parents commit treatment individual time insisting unreasoning obedience way duty obey simple laws come called bid wise parent humors desire independent action become friend adviser absolute rule shall cease 
get wrong reasoning recollect adopted analogy 
lately said margaret heard story happened nuremberg three four years ago 
rich man lived alone one immense mansions formerly dwellings warehouses 
reported child one knew certain 
forty years rumor kept rising falling never utterly dying away 
death found true 
son overgrown man unexercised intellect child kept strange way order save temptation error 
course great old child turned loose world every bad counsellor power 
know good evil 
father made blunder bringing ignorance taking innocence fourteen months riotous living city authorities take charge order save starvation 
could even use words effectively enough successful beggar 
used comparison suggested miss hale position master parent ought complain turning simile weapon 
mr hale setting wise parent model us said humored children desire independent action 
certainly time come hands independent action business hours hardly know would mean 
say masters would trenching independence hands way one feel justified interfered much life lead mills 
labor ten hours day us see right impose leading strings upon rest time 
value independence highly fancy degradation greater another man perpetually directing advising lecturing even planning closely way actions 
might wisest men powerful equally rebel resent interference imagine stronger feeling north england south 
beg pardon none equality friendship adviser advised classes every man stand unchristian isolated position apart jealous brother man constantly afraid rights trenched upon state fact 
sorry say appointment eight clock must take facts find night without trying account indeed would make difference determining act things stand facts must granted 
said margaret low voice seems makes difference world 
father made sign silent allow mr thornton finish say 
already standing preparing go 
must grant one point 
given strong feeling independence every darkshire man right obtrude views manner shall act upon another hating vehemently merely labor sell capital buy least said margaret determined say one thing least labor capital positions whatever man dealing set men whether reject use immense power lives welfare constantly intimately interwoven 
god made us must mutually dependent 
may ignore dependence refuse acknowledge others depend upon us respects payment weekly wages thing must nevertheless 
neither master help 
proudly independent man depends around insensible influence character life

wife daughter done quite right instance see moment could done otherwise 
nevertheless general rule true mr thornton said strike prolonged must end masters bringing hands distance indeed final result often invention machine would diminish need hands clear enough kindest thing refuse help might bolster folly 
boucher would go see first thing morning try find could done

margaret father first arrive 
mr hale anxiously punctual time specified 
one stairs drawing room mrs thornton fanny 
every cover taken apartment blazed forth yellow silk damask brilliantly flowered carpet 
every corner seemed filled ornament became weariness eye presented strange contrast bald ugliness look great mill yard wide folding gates thrown open admission carriages 
mill loomed high left hand side windows casting shadow many stories darkened summer evening time 
son engaged last moment business 
directly mr hale 
may beg take seat mr hale standing one windows mrs thornton spoke 
turned away saying find close neighborhood mill rather unpleasant times drew never 
become fine desire forget source son wealth power 
besides another factory milton 
one room alone two hundred twenty square yards 
meant smoke noise constant going coming work people might annoying agree mr hale said fanny 
continual smell steam oily machinery noise perfectly deafening 
heard noise called music far deafening 
engine room street end factory hardly hear except summer weather windows open continual murmur work people disturbs humming hive bees 
think connect son feel belongs head directs 
sounds come mill hands ungrateful enough turn perhaps heard 
business spoke entered reference steps going take make learn place 
expression face always stern deepened dark anger said 
clear away mr thornton entered room saw instant weight care anxiety could shake although guests received greeting appeared cheerful cordial 
shook hands margaret 
knew first time hands met though perfectly unconscious fact 
inquired mrs hale heard mr hale sanguine hopeful account glancing margaret understand far agreed father saw dissenting shadow crossed face 
looked intention struck anew great beauty 
never seen dress yet appeared elegance attire befitting noble figure lofty serenity countenance ought go always thus apparelled 
talking fanny could hear saw sister restless way continually arranging part gown wandering eyes glancing without purpose observation contrasted uneasily large soft eyes looked forth steadily one object light beamed gentle influence repose curving lines red lips parted interest listening companion said head little bent forwards make long sweeping line summit light caught glossy raven hair smooth ivory tip shoulder round white arms taper hands laid lightly across perfectly motionless pretty attitude 
mr thornton sighed took one sudden comprehensive glances 
turned back young ladies threw effort heart soul conversation mr hale 
people came 
fanny left margaret side helped mother receive guests 
mr thornton felt influx one speaking margaret restless apparent neglect 
never went near look 
knew better knew movements one else room 
margaret unconscious much amused watching people never thought whether left unnoticed 
somebody took dinner catch name seem much inclined talk 
animated conversation going among gentlemen ladies part silent employing taking notes dinner criticising dresses 
margaret caught clue general conversation grew interested listened attentively 
mr horsfall stranger whose visit town original germ party asking questions relative trade manufactures place rest gentlemen milton men giving answers explanations 
dispute arose warmly contested referred mr thornton hardly spoken gave opinion grounds clearly stated even opponents yielded 
margaret attention thus called host whole manner master house entertainer friends straightforward yet simple modest thoroughly dignified 
margaret thought never seen much advantage 
come house always something either eagerness kind vexed annoyance seemed ready pre suppose unjustly judged yet felt proud try make better understood 
among fellows uncertainty position 
regarded man great force character power many ways 
need struggle respect 
knew security gave fine grand quietness voice ways margaret missed 
habit talking ladies say little formal 
margaret hardly spoke 
surprised think much enjoyed dinner 
knew enough understand many local interests nay even technical words employed eager mill owners 
silently took decided part question discussing 
rate talked desperate earnest used style wearied old london parties 
wondered dwelling manufactures trade place allusion made strike pending 
yet know coolly things taken masters one possible end 
sure men cutting throats done many time would fools put hands rascally set paid delegates must take consequence 
one two thought thornton looked spirits course must lose turn 
accident might happen day thornton good manage strike one iron chap milton 
hands mistaken man trying dodge 
chuckled inwardly idea workmen discomfiture defeat attempt alter one iota thornton decreed 
rather dull margaret dinner 
glad gentlemen came merely caught father eye brighten sleepiness could listen something larger grander petty interests ladies talking 
liked exultation sense power milton men 
might rather rampant display savor boasting still seemed defy old limits possibility kind fine intoxication caused recollection achieved yet 
cooler moments might approve spirit things still much admire forgetfulness present anticipated triumphs inanimate matter future time none live see 
rather startled mr thornton spoke close elbow could see side discussion dinner miss hale certainly 
know little 
surprised however find mr horsfall said others thought diametrically opposite manner mr morison spoke 
gentleman quite person decide another gentlemanliness miss hale 
mean quite understand application word 
say morison true man 
know merely judge mr horsfall account 
suspect gentleman includes true man 
great deal would imply 
differ 
man higher completer gentleman 
mean asked margaret 
must understand words differently 
take gentleman term describes person relation others speak man consider merely regard fellow men relation life time eternity 
cast away lonely robinson crusoe prisoner immured dungeon life nay even saint patmos endurance strength faith best described spoken man 
rather weary word gentlemanly seems often inappropriately used often exaggerated distortion meaning full simplicity noun man adjective manly unacknowledged induced class cant day 
margaret thought moment could speak slow conviction called away eager manufacturers whose speeches could hear though could guess import short clear answers mr thornton gave came steady firm boom distant minute gun 
evidently talking turn suggesting course best pursued

afraid anything dastardly incendiarism 
open enemies protect violence apprehend
