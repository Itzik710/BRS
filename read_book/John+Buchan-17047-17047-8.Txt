losing grip 
belief sentiment means disbelief competence strength last fatalest heresy 
belief sentiment means foolish scepticism towards great things life 
none blood bone left honest belief 
hold religion half heartedly 
honest fanaticism thing intolerable 
mild rational sentimentalists would give ton ounce good prejudice 
george lewis laughed 
russia asked 
ah hope

fazir khan remained body 
remembered guest two days cursed underrating wandering englishman 
saw evil case 
chances spoil glory departed 
foresaw expeditions reprisal bada mawidi hunted like partridges upon mountains 
staked desperate chance one man ruin 
moment barbarian came sudden ferocity kicked dead 
looked moved juster appreciation 
thing man said 
stooping dipped finger blood touched forehead 
man said race kings
