meanwhile lucian considering could best make lydia repudiate cashel acquaintance feel thoroughly ashamed encouraged wholesomely mistrustful judgment future 
parliamentary experience taught provide well arranged relevant facts attempting influence opinions others subject 
knew prize fighting brutal illegal practice akin cock fighting like generally supposed obsolete 
knowing prone lydia suspect received opinion prejudice felt must inform particularly 
lord worthington astonishment asked dinner next evening listened interest descanted heart content favorite topic ring 
days passed bashville became nervous sometimes wondered whether lydia met cousin heard interview downing street 
fancied manner towards changed twice point asking sympathetic housemaids whether noticed 
wednesday suspense ended 
lucian came long conversation lydia library 
bashville honorable listen door felt strong temptation almost hoped sympathetic housemaid might prove less scrupulous 
miss carew influence extended farther bodily presence lucian revelation made complete privacy 
entered library looked serious asked whether neuralgia occasionally suffered 
replied indignation communication importance make

may warn character one guests without overstepping privilege certainly 
perhaps mean vernet 
perfectly aware exiled communard 
mean monsieur vernet 
understand hope approve strange fancy nihilists fenians doubtful persons think even might draw line prize fighter 
lydia lost color said almost inaudibly cashel byron knew exclaimed lucian scandalized 
lydia waited moment recover settled quietly chair replied calmly know tell nothing 
explain exactly prize fighter simply name indicates 
man fights prizes 
captain man war 
yet society place class least think 
could doubt society analogy whatever two cases 
let endeavor open eyes little possible sometimes tempted doubt 
prize fighter usually man naturally ferocious disposition acquired reputation among associates bully constantly quarrelling acquired practice fighting 
strength reputation generally find gambler willing stake sum money vanquish pugilist established fame single combat 
bets made admirers two men prize subscribed party contributing share combatants trained racehorses gamecocks like trained meet beat savagely one much injured continue combat 
takes place midst mob persons enjoy spectacles kind say vilest blackguards large city afford leave large many 
prize money contributed side often amounts upwards thousand pounds successful pugilist commands far higher terms giving tuition boxing tutor one universities coaching see man youth luck last may plenty money may even aping manners gentlemen teaches deceive careless people especially admire eccentricity character position 
true position mean becomes prize fighter 
well may handicraftsman kind journeyman butcher skinner tailor baker 
possibly soldier sailor policeman gentleman servant generally common laborer 
waterside prolific heroes 
never come higher rank never even better classes 
broken gentlemen likely succeed work needs strength endurance bull cruelty butcher 
end prize fighter 
like soon give trade 
repeatedly beaten one either bet subscribe provide stake 
invariably successful dare fight find like predicament 
either case occupation gone 
saved money opens sporting public house sells spirits worst description old rivals associates eventually drinks death bankruptcy 
however improvident unfortunate begs former patrons gives lessons 
finally patrons tired pupils fail relapses laboring class ruined constitution disfigured face brutalized nature tarnished reputation 
lydia remained silent long lucian expression magisterial severity first deepened wavered finally gave way sense injury seemed forgotten 
protest treatment looked said lord worthington introduce man class asked 
probably thought chose make request without previous inquiry blame found saddled undesirable acquaintance 
recollect asked introduction platform wiltstoken presence man 
ruffian would capable making disturbance much less offence explanation refusal would given 
lucian said lydia tone gentle admonition asked introduced tenant whose respectability vouched letting warren lodge 
lucian reddened 
lord worthington explain mr byron appearance mrs hoskyn stupid joke 
mrs hoskyn worried worthington bring celebrity house revenge took pugilistic protege 
hm defend worthington 
discretion hardly expected 
discretion enough understand case kind thoroughly 
let pass 
thinking upon tell singular people whose existence hardly knew 
lucian course reading come upon denunciations every race pursuit sun 
respectable well informed men held jews irishmen christians atheists lawyers doctors politicians actors artists flesh eaters spirit drinkers necessity degraded beings 
statements easily proved taking black sheep flock holding type 
reasonable argue man character nature profession yet even unsafe 
war cruel business soldiers necessarily bloodthirsty inhuman men 
quite satisfied prize fighter violent dangerous man follows violent dangerous profession suppose call profession 
lucian speak interrupted continuing yet concerns present 
found anything mr byron personally ordinary representative class rather think hope extraordinary representative 
traced history back boyhood cabin boy 
apparently failed recommend employers capacity became errand boy sort maitre armes melbourne 
discovered genius lay presently appeared ring unfortunate young man named ducket whose jaw fractured 
laid foundation fame 
fought several battles unvarying success last allowed valor get better discretion far kill englishman contended desperate obstinacy two hours 
informed particular blow felled poor wretch last time known pugilistic circles cashel killer attempted repeat subsequent encounters without however achieving fatal result 
failure doubtless severe disappointment 
fled australia reappeared america resumed victorious career distinguishing specially throwing gigantic opponent dreadful fashion men laming life 
thank lucian said lydia rather faintly 
quite enough 
sure true authority lord worthington number newspaper reports showed 
byron probably proud give fullest confirmation record 
add justice looked upon model pugilists temperance general good conduct 
remember remarking days ago another subject meaningless observations given right thread string yes said webber disconcerted allusion 
acquaintance man case point 
obtruded horrible profession upon every time met 
actually seen publicly cheered pugilist hero yet track ignorant existence calling looked seen nothing

whenever met lucian webber talked cashel invariably coming conclusion though oddity behavior gratified lydia unfortunate taste eccentricity never regarded serious interest would circumstances renew intercourse 
lucian found little solace conversations generally suffered vague sense meanness 
yet next time met would drift discussing cashel always rewarded alice admirable propriety views dancing least three times dancing business evening 
dancing still less congenial conversation 
lucian times much solemnity manner frenchmen reproach englishmen danced stiffly unskilfully 
alice whose muscular power energy superior anything kind mr mellish could artificially produce longed swift motion violent exercise even expert partner could hardly tame quietude dancing practiced london

shortly afterwards met lucian cinderella dancing party concluding midnight 
came eleven usual gravely asked whether might pleasure dancing 
form address never varied 
surprise made difficulty granting favor eventually offered second extra
