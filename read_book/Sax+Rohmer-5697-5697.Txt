ambitious man consequently one took big chances 
nothing disturbed silence sat upon divan pressed button torch shining low beamed apartment peering curiously weird shadows place 
calculated position cohen occupied last moments life sense uncanny touched coldly 
thought unnatural screams spoken poland strange instinct prompted curl feet upon divan though secret menace crawled upon floor amid many rugs carpets 
must endeavor reconstruct plan upon american cracksman operated 
poland persistent belief cohen known fabled hoard huang chow concealed 
durham began deliberate inspection place

cupboards contained broken pieces crockery less damaged curios one kind another none gave clue seeking 
examined couch upon huang chow seated first met although searched scientifically rewarded discovery 
fusty unpleasant smell noticeable point elsewhere room found staring speculatively wide carpeted stairs 
next turned attention lacquered coffin occupied corresponding recess filled couch

opening case doubtless others would set alarm bells ringing 
unimportant discovery brought little nearer solution chief problem engaged mind 
assuming cohen opened one cases alarmed old huang chow steps latter taken deal intruder resulted ghastly death disposed body durham stood musing looking plate glass delicate porcelain beneath faint sound intruded upon stillness 
gave another idea 
part floor stone paved part wood

faint swishing trickling sound perceptible place beneath 
ah murmured 
remembering premises almost overhung thames divined cellars flooded high tide kind drain cutting running underneath house 
stood listening intently sound within building 
thought detected something stood alert heard faint scuffling might occasioned rats even mice subtle unpleasant way suggest movements familiar rodents 
even perceived ceased leaving wondering uncomfortably conscious sudden dread surroundings 
wondered part mysterious house lala resided recognizing departure must leave traces determined prosecute inquiries far possible since another opportunity might arise 
baffled still hopeful 
something smell place threatened unnerve perhaps silence remained quite unbroken save acute listening one detected dripping water

finally asked asked matter old huang chow disposed people strange manner sought rob 
morality case complicated obscure falling spell lala dark eyes 
always professional pride came rescue 
murder done whether justifiably otherwise entrusted discovery murderer
