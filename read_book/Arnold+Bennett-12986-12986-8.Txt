first goal scored twenty seconds also last match 
callear reputation established 
useless solemn experts point simply larking gallery result shocking fluke callear reputation established 
became idol populace 
denry walked gingerly field grand stand loudly cheered could help feeling somehow scored goal

multitudes ever greeted mayoral procession bursley 
footballers however appeared ordinary costume many frock coats wore neckties club colors device agreed nicest taste 
st luke church crowded stranger churchyard also crowded 
church barely held procession ladies influence accommodated seats advance 
thousands persons filled churchyard prevent crushing packed fane bursting weakest point apse doors locked guarded 
four women swooned service neither mrs machin senior nellie among four 
first time one known swoon religious service held november 
fact alone gave tremendous prestige denry mayoralty 
nellie arm emerged church thunders organ greeting received churchyard though solemnity occasion forbade clapping lacked naught brilliance efficacy 
real point delight corporation sunday fully appreciated till later 
expected collection sermon would much larger usual congregation much larger usual 
church wardens startled find four times large usual
