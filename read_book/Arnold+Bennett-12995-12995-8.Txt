little love 
moreover circumstances marriage peculiar married dark brooding passionate girl 
mrs coe younger two sisters named olive wardle well known desirable circles five towns

certainly asked two sisters named olive 
answer though olive one olive two treated sisters even treated sisters sisters 
even half sisters 
first met age nine
