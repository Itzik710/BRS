boy sent private school high character sir peregrine sure sent advice 
looking peculiar position mother said sir peregrine young daughter law peculiar position relatives think better appear assume anything early life nothing better conducted mr crabfield establishment much consideration hesitation recommending send son 
thus lucius mason sent mr crabfield think idea originated sir peregrine 
perhaps well added baronet perry together school though objection meeting holidays 
mr crabfield vacations always timed suit harrow holidays 
perry mentioned grandson sir peregrine young peregrine coming days future lord cleeve 
lucius mason modestly sent mr crabfield establishment great marlow young peregrine orme prouder hopes commenced career public school

question future life lucius mason became one great importance necessary consult sir peregrine orme young man 
mother suggested first law great mr furnival formerly home circuit practising london special friend would give son possible aid direction 
living man could give better aid great mr furnival lucius mason would none law 
resolve pronounced clearly yet germany whither mother visited bearing long letter written great mr furnival 
nevertheless young mason would none law 
idea said lawyers liars 
whereupon mother rebuked conceited ignorance want charity gain point 
however another string bow 
objected lawyer might become civil engineer 
circumstances made sir peregrine orme intimate great mr brown 
indeed mr brown great obligations sir peregrine sir peregrine promised use influence 
lucius mason said civil engineers tradesmen upper class tradesmen intellects said wished use intellect choose tradesman 
mother rebuked well deserved asked profession thought

would willingly left mr dockwrath possession say word two milk necessary sixteen children 
lucius mason ducal ideas intimated opinion right liked 
mr dockwrath told fields surrendered favor would possession till heir come age mr dockwrath told tellings easily forgotten men sixteen children 
thus mr mason became agriculturist special scientific views chemistry philologist object making pursuit bear upon studies reference races man 
convinced certain admixtures ammonia earths could produce cereal results hitherto unknown farming world tracing roots words could trace also wanderings man since expulsion adam garden
