may take opportunity remarking critics frequently assume attribute changes corporeal structure mental power exclusively natural selection variations often called spontaneous whereas even first edition origin species distinctly stated great weight must attributed inherited effects use disuse respect body mind 
also attributed amount modification direct prolonged action changed conditions life 
allowance must made occasional reversions structure must forget called correlated growth meaning thereby various parts organization unknown manner connected one part varies others variations one accumulated selection parts modified 
said several critics found many details structure man could explained natural selection invented sexual selection gave however tolerably clear sketch principle first edition origin species stated applicable man 
subject sexual selection treated full length present work simply opportunity first afforded 
struck likeness many half favourable criticisms sexual selection appeared first natural selection would explain details certainly applicable extent employed 
conviction power sexual selection remains unshaken probable almost certain several conclusions hereafter found erroneous hardly fail case first treatment subject 
naturalists become familiar idea sexual selection believe much largely accepted already fully favourably received several capable judges

introduction 
nature following work best understood brief account came written 
many years collected notes origin descent man without intention publishing subject rather determination publish thought thus add prejudices views 
seemed sufficient indicate first edition origin species work light would thrown origin man history implies man must included organic beings general conclusion respecting manner appearance earth 
case wears wholly different aspect 
naturalist like carl vogt ventures say address president national institution geneva personne en europe au moins n ose plus soutenir la creation independante et de toutes pieces des especes manifest least large number naturalists must admit species modified descendants species especially holds good younger rising naturalists 
greater number accept agency natural selection though urge whether justice future must decide greatly overrated importance 
older honored chiefs natural science many unfortunately still opposed evolution every form 
consequence views adopted naturalists ultimately every case followed others scientific led put together notes see far general conclusions arrived former works applicable man 
seemed desirable never deliberately applied views species taken singly 
confine attention one form deprived weighty arguments derived nature affinities connect together whole groups organisms geographical distribution past present times geological succession 
homological structure embryological development rudimentary organs species remain considered whether man animal attention may directed great classes facts afford appears ample conclusive evidence favor principle gradual evolution 
strong support derived arguments however always kept mind 
sole object work consider firstly whether man like every species descended pre existing form secondly manner development thirdly value differences called races man 
shall confine points necessary describe detail differences several races enormous subject fully described many valuable works 
high antiquity man recently demonstrated labors host eminent men beginning boucher de perthes indispensable basis understanding origin 
shall therefore take conclusion granted may refer readers admirable treatises sir charles lyell sir john lubbock others 
shall occasion allude amount difference man anthropomorphous apes prof huxley opinion competent judges conclusively shewn every visible character man differs less higher apes lower members order primates 
work contains hardly original facts regard man conclusions arrived drawing rough draft appeared interesting thought might interest others 
often confidently asserted man origin never known ignorance frequently begets confidence knowledge know little know much positively assert problem never solved science 
conclusion man co descendant species ancient lower extinct form degree new 
lamarck long ago came conclusion lately maintained several eminent naturalists philosophers instance wallace huxley lyell vogt lubbock buchner rolle etc

last naturalist besides great work generelle morphologie recently second edition published naturliche schopfungsgeschichte fully discusses genealogy man 
work appeared essay written probably never completed 
almost conclusions arrived find confirmed naturalist whose knowledge many points much fuller mine 
wherever added fact view prof haeckel writings give authority text statements leave originally stood manuscript occasionally giving foot notes references works confirmation doubtful interesting points 
many years seemed highly probable sexual selection played important part differentiating races man origin species first edition page contented merely alluding belief 
came apply view man found indispensable treat whole subject full detail 

prof haeckel author time work first appeared discussed subject sexual selection seen full importance since publication origin able manner various works 
consequently second part present work treating sexual selection extended inordinate length compared first part could avoided 
intended adding present volumes essay expression various emotions man lower animals 
attention called subject many years ago sir charles bell admirable work 
illustrious anatomist maintains man endowed certain muscles solely sake expressing emotions 
view obviously opposed belief man descended lower form necessary consider 
likewise wished ascertain far emotions expressed manner different races man 
owing length present work thought better reserve essay separate publication

chapter evidence descent man lower form 
nature evidence bearing origin man homologous structures man lower animals miscellaneous points correspondence development rudimentary structures muscles sense organs hair bones reproductive organs etc 
bearing three great classes facts origin man 
wishes decide whether man modified descendant pre existing form would probably first enquire whether man varies however slightly bodily structure mental faculties whether variations transmitted offspring accordance laws prevail lower animals 
variations result far ignorance permits us judge general causes governed general laws case organisms instance correlation inherited effects use disuse etc 
man subject similar malconformations result arrested development reduplication parts etc display anomalies reversion former ancient type structure might also naturally enquired whether man like many animals given rise varieties sub races differing slightly races differing much must classed doubtful species races distributed world crossed react first succeeding generations many points 
enquirer would next come important point whether man tends increase rapid rate lead occasional severe struggles existence consequently beneficial variations whether body mind preserved injurious ones eliminated 
races species men whichever term may applied encroach replace one another finally become extinct shall see questions indeed obvious respect must answered affirmative manner lower animals

mankind selfishness experience imitation probably add mr bain shewn power sympathy led hope receiving good return perform acts sympathetic kindness others sympathy much strengthened habit 
however complex manner feeling may originated one high importance animals aid defend one another increased natural selection communities included greatest number sympathetic members would flourish best rear greatest number offspring 
however impossible decide many cases whether certain social instincts acquired natural selection indirect result instincts faculties sympathy reason experience tendency imitation whether simply result long continued habit 
remarkable instinct placing sentinels warn community danger hardly indirect result faculties must therefore directly acquired

selfish contentious people cohere without coherence nothing effected 
tribe rich qualities would spread victorious tribes course time would judging past history turn overcome tribe still highly endowed 
thus social moral qualities would tend slowly advance diffused throughout world 
may asked within limits tribe large number members first become endowed social moral qualities standard excellence raised extremely doubtful whether offspring sympathetic benevolent parents faithful comrades would reared greater numbers children selfish treacherous parents belonging tribe 
ready sacrifice life many savage rather betray comrades would often leave offspring inherit noble nature 
bravest men always willing come front war freely risked lives others would average perish larger numbers men 
therefore hardly seems probable number men gifted virtues standard excellence could increased natural selection survival fittest speaking one tribe victorious another 
although circumstances leading increase number thus endowed within tribe complex clearly followed trace probable steps 
first place reasoning powers foresight members became improved man would soon learn aided fellow men would commonly receive aid return 
low motive might acquire habit aiding fellows habit performing benevolent actions certainly strengthens feeling sympathy gives first impulse benevolent actions 
habits moreover followed many generations probably tend inherited 
another much powerful stimulus development social virtues afforded praise blame fellow men 
instinct sympathy already seen primarily due habitually bestow praise blame others whilst love former dread latter applied instinct doubt originally acquired like social instincts natural selection 
early period progenitors man course development became capable feeling impelled praise blame fellow creatures course say

rudest savages feel sentiment glory clearly shew preserving trophies prowess habit excessive boasting even extreme care take personal appearance decorations unless regarded opinion comrades habits would senseless 
certainly feel shame breach lesser rules apparently remorse shewn case australian grew thin could rest delayed murder woman propitiate dead wife spirit 
though met recorded case scarcely credible savage sacrifice life rather betray tribe one deliver prisoner rather break parole 
mr wallace gives cases contributions theory natural selection p 
would feel remorse inmost soul failed duty held sacred 
may therefore conclude primeval man remote period influenced praise blame fellows 
obvious members tribe would approve conduct appeared general good would reprobate appeared evil 
good unto others unto others ye would unto foundation stone morality 
therefore hardly possible exaggerate importance rude times love praise dread blame 
man impelled deep instinctive feeling sacrifice life good others yet roused actions sense glory would example excite wish glory men would strengthen exercise noble feeling admiration 
might thus far good tribe begetting offspring tendency inherit high character 
increased experience reason man perceives remote consequences actions self regarding virtues temperance chastity etc early times seen utterly disregarded come highly esteemed even held sacred 
need however repeat said head fourth chapter 
ultimately moral sense conscience becomes highly complex sentiment originating social instincts largely guided approbation fellow men ruled reason self interest later times deep religious feelings confirmed instruction habit 
must forgotten although high standard morality gives slight advantage individual man children men tribe yet increase number well endowed men advancement standard morality certainly give immense advantage one tribe another 
tribe including many members possessing high degree spirit patriotism fidelity obedience courage sympathy always ready aid one another sacrifice common good would victorious tribes would natural selection

chez tous les singes les plis posterieurs se developpent les premiers les plis anterieurs se developpent plus tard aussi la vertebre occipitale et la parietale sont elles relativement tres grandes chez le foetus 
l homme presente une exception remarquable quant l epoque de l apparition des plis frontaux qui sont les premiers indiques mais le developpement general du lobe frontal envisage seulement par rapport son volume suit les memes lois que dans les singes gratiolet memoire sur les plis cerebres de l homme et des primateaux p tab

huxley par exemple n hesite pas sur ce point
