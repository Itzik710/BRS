autumn came 
clouded sky descended low upon black contors hills dead leaves danced spiral whirls naked trees till wind sighing profoundly laid rest hollows bare valleys 
morning till night one could see land black denuded boughs boughs gnarled twisted contorted pain swaying sadly wet clouds soaked earth 
clear gentle streams summer days rushed discolored raging stones barred way sea fury madness bent upon suicide

day madame levaille gone early afternoon house near kervanion 
pay men worked granite quarry went good time little house contained shop workmen could spend wages without trouble going town 
house stood alone amongst rocks 
lane mud stones ended door 
sea winds coming ashore stonecutter point fresh fierce turmoil waves howled violently unmoved heaps black boulders holding steadily short armed high crosses tremendous rush invisible 
sweep gales sheltered dwelling stood calm resonant disquieting like calm center hurricane 
stormy nights tide bay fougere fifty feet house resembled immense black pit ascended mutterings sighs sands alive complaining 
high tide returning water assaulted ledges rock short rushes ending bursts livid light columns spray flew inland stinging death grass pastures 
darkness came hills flowed coast put red fires sunset went seaward pursuing retiring tide 
wind dropped sun leaving maddened sea devastated sky 
heavens house seemed draped black rags held pins fire 
madame levaille evening servant workmen tried induce depart 
old woman like ought bed late hour good humouredly repeated

white man gazed straight darkness wide open eyes 
fear fascination inspiration wonder death death near unavoidable unseen soothed unrest race stirred indistinct intimate thoughts 
ever ready suspicion evil gnawing suspicion lurks hearts flowed stillness round stillness profound dumb made appear untrustworthy infamous like placid impenetrable mask unjustifiable violence 
fleeting powerful disturbance earth enfolded starlight peace became shadowy country inhuman strife battle field phantoms terrible charming august ignoble struggling ardently possession helpless hearts 
unquiet mysterious country inextinguishable desires fears 
plaintive murmur rose night murmur saddening startling great solitudes surrounding woods tried whisper ear wisdom immense lofty indifference 
sounds hesitating vague floated air round shaped slowly words last flowed gently murmuring stream soft monotonous sentences

name brother three times called afraid life 
canoe could find country death forgotten death unknown white man sat 
arsat rose stood indistinct silent figure dying embers fire 
lagoon mist drifting low crept erasing slowly glittering images stars 
great expanse white vapor covered land flowed cold gray darkness eddied noiseless whirls round tree trunks platform house seemed float upon restless impalpable illusion sea 
far away tops trees stood outlined twinkle heaven like sombre forbidding shore coast deceptive pitiless black 
arsat voice vibrated loudly profound peace 
get would faced mankind 
words went ringing empty distances 
paused seemed listen dying away far beyond help beyond recall 
said quietly tuan loved brother 
breath wind made shiver 
high head high silent sea mist drooping leaves palms rattled together mournful expiring sound 
white man stretched legs 
chin rested chest murmured sadly without lifting head love brothers 
arsat burst intense whispering violence care died wanted peace heart 
seemed hear stir house listened stepped noiselessly 
white man stood 
breeze coming fitful puffs 
stars shone paler retreated frozen depths immense space 
chill gust wind seconds perfect calm absolute silence 
behind black wavy line forests column golden light shot heavens spread semicircle eastern horizon 
sun risen 
mist lifted broke drifting patches vanished thin flying wreaths unveiled lagoon lay polished black heavy shadows foot wall trees 
white eagle rose slanting ponderous flight reached clear sunshine appeared dazzlingly brilliant moment soaring higher became dark motionless speck vanished blue left earth forever 
white man standing gazing upwards doorway heard hut confused broken murmur distracted words ending loud groan 
suddenly arsat stumbled outstretched hands shivered stood still time fixed eyes 
said burns 
face sun showed edge tree tops rising steadily 
breeze freshened great brilliance burst upon lagoon sparkled rippling water 
forests came clear shadows morning became distinct rushed nearer stop short great stir leaves nodding boughs swaying branches 
merciless sunshine whisper unconscious life grew louder speaking incomprehensible voice round dumb darkness human sorrow 
arsat eyes wandered slowly stared rising sun 
see nothing said half aloud 
nothing said white man moving edge platform waving hand boat 
shout came faintly lagoon sampan began glide towards abode friend ghosts 
want come wait morning said white man looking away upon water 
tuan said arsat softly 
shall eat sleep house must first see road 
see nothing see nothing light peace world death death many 
sons mother left midst enemies going back 
drew long breath went dreamy tone little shall see clear enough strike strike 
died darkness 
flung arms wide open let fall along body stood still unmoved face stony eyes staring sun 
white man got canoe 
polers ran smartly along sides boat looking shoulders beginning weary journey 
high stern head muffled white rags juragan sat moody letting paddle trail water 
white man leaning arms grass roof little cabin looked back shining ripple boat wake 
sampan passed lagoon creek lifted eyes 
arsat moved 
stood lonely searching sunshine looked beyond great light cloudless day darkness world illusions
