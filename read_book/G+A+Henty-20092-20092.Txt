shall miss boy sorely young birds kept always nest think lad good stuff pity keep shut 
john brother law went although may never said quite much said enough know intentions 
god pleased bestow children upon us philip nearest relation stands us almost light son 
god blest work last twenty years though done hope fully share towards assisting countrymen distress putting always one third income purpose rich man 
factory grown larger larger desired greater gains might give employment countrymen 
since death lequoc twelve years ago entirely hands living quietly done greater portion profits laid every year therefore putting account money good sister laid philip start life ill equipped 
know lad said nothing wishes may entertain age would becoming elders speak late read letters friends france listened tales freshly arrived ruined homes noted color rose fingers tightened sword could see passionately longing join struggling cruel oppressors 
less interested noble struggle dutch making spaniards struggle many exiled countrymen sharing 
one mother cousins count de la noue know prominent among huguenot leaders others relatives ranged side 
present truce parties feel hollow one nevertheless offers good opportunity visit mother family 
whether prospect ever recovering lands confiscated flight uncertain 
huguenots ever maintain ground win freedom worship france may confiscated estates many cases restored however perfectly indifferent 
younger man close factory return france bear share defense faith 
like send philip substitute

wish lad become courtier english french englishmen done foreign armies gain great honor reputation wish fight behalf persecuted people god whether france holland heartiest goodwill die could die glorious cause 
let us talk matters gaspard 
one needs thought words spoken 
two days later john fletcher long talk phil 
latter delighted heard project greatly accord sides character 
english lad looked forward eagerly adventure peril french reformed religion rejoiced thought fighting huguenots persecutors serving men whose names reputations familiar 
know uncle plans yet phil father said 
went matters leaving talked settled whether offer accepted 
purposes well regards heir 
already bought blunt mardyke farms purposes buy parts estates sir james holford may slip knight fingers gambling table 
therefore time become person standing county although care little things phil yet like somewhat mere squire serve great captains coligny conde give reputation weight 
good uncle friends think little matters uninfluenced 
coligny example man honor honor altogether leader reformed faith great soldier 
think honor reputation despised 
doubtless first thing man good christian 
way prevent great man nay add greatness 
noble kinsfolk france uncle doubtless commit may opportunities distinguishing 
occur sure avail one comes good stock sides although fletchers yeomen generation generation ever ready take give share hard blows going battles fought since william norman came fletcher fought english ranks whether france scotland troubles

ah charles maitre armes 
charles cousin philip also pupil remains

art fencing time reached perfection afterwards attained 
swords used long straight sharpened edges used much cutting thrusting 
single combat foot long daggers generally held left hand used purpose guarding striking close quarters 
put thick quilted doublets light helmets visors 
use dagger philip never seen one used england 
taught guard swords well strike 
monsieur learned english teachers maitre armes asked 
english teachers well french philip said 
learn use sword england uncle monsieur vaillant taken great pains taught also french professors arms lived canterbury happened pass prefer english style fighting 
generally stand upright work equally poised two feet advance retreat lean body far forward arm outstretched seems cripple movements 
yes puts body harm way francois said 
arm business guard body francois impossible strike downright blow leaning far forward 
strike little nowadays single combat maitre armes said 
point effective 
doubtless maitre charles philip agreed learned fencing sake fighting duels able take part field battle 
spaniards said masters straight sword yet roughly used western seas sailors methinks always use edge 
two took position facing 
attitude strikingly different 
francois stood bent knees leaning far forward philip stood erect knees slightly bent ready spring either forwards backwards arm half extended

francois well taught benefit whenever paris best masters 
extremely active warmed work philip difficulty standing ground impetuous rushes 
minutes passed without either succeeding touching

pistol however becoming recognized portion outfit cavalier field following francois advice philip practiced one steadily became fair shot 
cowardly weapons francois said useful battle 
surrounded three four pikemen thrusting good thing able disembarrass one two 
besides german horsemen guises employ many carry firearms contest would uneven armed sword though part wish governments europe would agree away firearms every description

spite news admiral still urged patience brother andelot took lead among party action pointed waited leaders dragged away prison resistance huguenots would hopeless 
since last war three thousand huguenots put violent deaths

fortunately court last war besotted belief absolutely powerless every hope taking surprise 
also glad war determined upon philip said 
since arrived heard nothing tales persecution cruelty 
quite agree time come huguenots must either fight rights abandon country altogether go exile many already done renounce religion 
see new servant philip 
active likely looking lad rather young 
know nothing campaigning 
believe handy fellow plenty sense shrewdness work would rather man age older one 
different 
francois count de laville servant whatever age would hold respect 
younger far less consequence old servant might want take tuition 
moreover hard work done would rather young fellow like older man 
always making boy philip 
look going play man part 
mean play far francois really make day older 
well mind word soul day fixed 
next fortnight scene chateau busy one 
huguenot gentlemen came went 
fifty men arms accompany francois inspected arms armor served 
tenantry came small parties also provided weapons offensive defensive armoury might readiness assemble defense chateau shortest notice

hitherto suffered little huguenots strong south poitou niort nearest town chateau huguenots absolute majority far strong molested opposite party 
nevertheless towns public worship suspended chateaux castles nobles huguenots could gather worship without fear interruption outrage 
considerable debate whether francois troop march join admiral chatillon sur loing proceed southeast parties nearly equally balanced former course decided upon 
march would perilous conde admiral brother andelot would force gathered important point moreover francois de la noue would

may armor useful day battle philip said present seems francois would much rather without 
quite agree philip 
fight gentlemen armed swords would gladly go battle unprotected men lances one needs defense 
however care much got rid helmet truth heavy burden 
methinks francois armor ere long abandoned arquebuses cannon coming use 
give protection better methinks lightness freedom action trouble wearing iron stuff merely protection lances 
trained wear armor therefore feel less inconvenience never much breast plate feel present almost lost use arms

admiral policy avoid fighting

thought prospect fighting keep think better accompany sieur arblay 
mission dangerous one demand activity energy courage possess south neither cold famine contend far greater opportunities maybe gaining credit would army like proved enemy every man brave 
another reason may case consider youth advantage

absent army conde admiral marched lorraine eluding forces barred march effected junction german men arms brought aid duke casimir second son elector palatine 
however germans refused march step farther unless received pay agreed upon started 
conde treasury empty means whatever satisfying demand 
vain duke casimir tried persuade soldiers defer claims trust french co religionists satisfy demands later 
unanimous refusal march step obtained money 
admiral addressed officers soldiers 
pointed present moment everything depended upon obtaining assistance germans indeed demanding rights according agreement made implored come assistance prince crisis 
great influence among soldiers appeal promptly generally acceded officers men alike stripped chains jewels money valuables kinds made sum required satisfy germans 
soon important affair settled united army turned face westward intention giving battle anew walls paris 
however terribly deficient artillery powder stores kinds military chest empty soldiers without pay necessary march exact contributions small catholic towns villages army marched spite orders admiral certain amount pillage carried soldiers 
recruited strength troops short stay orleans admiral moved towards paris 
since commencement war negotiations going fitfully 
court thought huguenots formidable pushed negotiations earnest 
whenever upon contrary believed royal forces would able crush admiral negotiations came standstill 
admiral long march east would grant terms whatever could possibly accepted soon junction effected duke casimir germans huguenot army turned face paris court became eager conclude peace 
prince conde army arrived chartres negotiators met king professed readiness grant many concessions seemed objects huguenots could attained without fighting cardinal chatillon huguenot nobles went forward personal conference royal commissioners lonjumeau 
much discussion points insisted upon huguenots conceded articles treaty drawn copies sent paris chartres 
admiral conde perceived absence guarantees observance conditions side bound treaty would little avail could broken soon army menacing paris scattered 
feeling among great portion nobles followers however strongly favor conditions accepted 
nobles becoming beggared continuance war expenses part paid private means 
followers indeed received pay fed estates lying untilled want hands 
men eager return farms families strong general desire peace admiral conde bowed 
agreed terms pending ratification raised siege chartres 
already force dwindling rapidly 
large numbers marched away homes without even asking leave leaders soon ceased position make demands guarantees peace lonjumeau therefore signed 
provisions gave little huguenots preceding arrangement kind campaign left parties much position occupied huguenots took arms 
chapter third huguenot war 
treaty lonjumeau signed many weeks huguenots sensible folly committed throwing away advantages gained war laying arms upon terms treaty made perfidious woman weak unstable king advisers bent upon destroying reformed religion 
seen former edicts toleration first modified revoked reason even hope new treaty wrung court fears would respected 
huguenots surprised find therefore soon sent back german auxiliaries returned homes ink indeed scarcely dry paper upon treaty written conditions virtually annulled 
pulpit every catholic church france treaty denounced violent language openly declared could peace huguenots 
returned home murdered great numbers many cities mobs rose massacred defenceless protestants 
heavy persecutions outbreak war exceeded followed 
governors provinces openly refused carry conditions treaty 
charles issued proclamation edict intended include districts appanages mother royal bourbon princes 
towns soldiers quartered upon huguenots robbed ill treated pleasure six months nominal peace lasted less ten thousand huguenots slaughtered various parts france 
prince conde admiral brothers leaders may skilful generals brave men countess de laville said indignantly francois troop reduced war fever hardship one third number returned chateau senses permitted cozened laying arms without receiving single guarantee terms treaty observed 
far better never taken arms 
king come regard us enemies

instead better position shall worse 
given towns captured thrown away every advantage gained driven take arms shall worse position longer despise us future guard 
repeating surprise last september 
disappointed admiral andelot la rochefoucauld genlis 
conde never trusted one relied upon extremity 
royal prince brought courts loves gaiety ease although say untrue huguenot cause yet would gladly accommodate matters see even treaty great bulk huguenots country utterly deserted liberty worship denied lives mercy bigots 
think philip enough fighting party wilfully throw away sacrifices thinking returning home wait see matters go permission wait philip said 
lament peace seems leave us worse position war agree last ere long huguenots driven take arms 
francois become brothers cause either lost would fain remain 
well philip

however peace made must make best

therefore think peace 
summer passed quietly laville

nevertheless certain hostilities would long delayed 
catholics seeing advantage perfect organization huguenots given commencement war established leagues almost every province

jeanne navarre well nigh dangerous admiral seize cub carry paris hope go willingly accord saint amand 
la motte fenelon negotiating last fortnight behalf court 
clearly far better go taken prisoner 
would seem desertion huguenot cause would tremendous blow 
hand taken prisoner would drive many huguenot take arms content rest quiet 
moreover protestant princes germany elizabeth england would protest whatever court may say admiral hardly affirm jeanne navarre thinking making war charles reason defense faith 
besides harm nerac always lay hands like

vacancies troop filled young men estate responded summons countess men take place fallen son command 
young prince navarre cognac paid frequent visits philip taken great liking begged coligny appoint one knights told special bodyguard 
admiral however repeated arguments used 
young prince though borne well would create much jealousy among young nobles choose foreigner honorable post 
councillors staid men admiral want someone talk without ceremony 
plenty young frenchmen prince 
must choose one take count de laville saying yesterday liked 
yes something like cousin 
think together given philip manner 
philip like 
would doubtless feel great honor prince doubt offer post young englishman would accept 
come seek honor fight faith 
conversation one day found simple purpose came however honorable post sure would prefer one gave full opportunity taking active part 
de laville different 
french noble maybe someday king france 
brave adventurous spirit methinks young englishman greater genius war 
cousin although older observe generally appeals opinion frankly nobly given chief credit affairs engaged 
admiral mistaken 
francois asked would like appointed one gentlemen prince person embraced offer saw afforded great openings advancement future 
regret would separate philip 
said much cousin informing unexpected honor befallen philip replied think francois 
shall course sorry shall see often would wrong refuse offer 
king france children 
two brothers unmarried 
anjou accounts reckless dissolute alencon sickly 
alone stand henry navarre throne france succeed intimates gain honors rank possessions 
young noble would feel honored selected post 
fighting one say long troubles may last greatly mistaken round henry navarre reaches manhood full share 
therefore two newly made young knights went la rochelle quiet sea air understanding soon strength thoroughly recovered francois resign command troop philip would ride prince navarre cousin conde 
francois written mother news appointment days reached la rochelle received answer expressing gratification 
rejoice said post high honor take somewhat heat fray
