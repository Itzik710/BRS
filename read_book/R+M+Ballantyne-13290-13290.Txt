indians send arrows immense distance unerring aim martin barney many opportunity witnessing long weary journey foot forest home savages 
chapter xix worse worse everything seems go wrong together although indians maltreat unfortunate strangers thus fallen hands made proceed forced marches wilderness neither barney martin late much used long walks felt journey severely 
old trader accustomed everything wretched unfortunate uncomfortable childhood plodded onward silent indifference 
country passed became every day rugged length assumed character wild mountainous district 
sometimes wound way zigzag manner mountain sides paths narrow could scarcely find foot hold 
times descended narrow valleys saw great numbers wild animals various kinds indians killed food 
reached mountain district loosed hands prisoners order enable climb easily 
indeed many places scramble carefully would impossible one climb hands tied behind back 
indians knew full well ran risk losing prisoners attempted escape dozens number watch behind either side ready dart away pursuit 
moreover barney feeling horror bare idea poisoned arrows effectually prevented making smallest attempt escape 
cutlass heavy stick would attacked whole tribe single handed fought till brains knocked thought small arrows would pour upon hundreds made dash woods certain death would follow slightest scratch discarded idea rebellion 
one animals killed indians time black jaguar magnificent animal fierce 
discovered crouching thicket backed precipice could escape charging ranks enemies 
nobly 
roar rebounded face high cliff echoed valley like peal thunder sprang rushed savages front scattered like chaff right left 
instant fifty blow pipes sent poisoned shafts body convulsive bounds splendid monarch american forests fell dead ground 
black jaguar somewhat rare animal seldom seen 
one therefore hailed great prize skin claws carefully preserved 
afternoon day party came broad stream numerous tribes country constructed simple curious bridge

martin spoke intense fervor gazed anxiously face friend 
dark frown gathered 
sudden prospect forcibly torn young companion regarded almost mother tenderness stirred enthusiastic fiery temperament center gazed wildly weapon 
savages anticipated intention ere could grasp offensive weapon two number leaped upon moment martin arms pinioned powerful grasp 
och ye murderin blackguards cried barney hitting right left knocking savage blow

martin struggled fiercely free would succeeded two powerful indians hastened help one first seized 
despite frantic efforts dragged forcibly mountain gorge echoes rang cries shouted despairingly name friend 
barney fought like tiger could make impression numbers 
although least dozen indians lay around bleeding stunned savage blows fists species warfare entirely new fresh savages crowded round 
wish kill numerous though found easy matter secure powerful man martin turned last despairing glance towards camp ere turn path shut view hammer like fists comrade still smashing naked creatures danced like monkeys round war like shouts stentorian voice reverberated among cliffs caverns mountain pass long hid view 
thus martin barney separated wild regions near sierra dos parecis brazil 
chapter xx martin reflects much forms firm resolve indian village mind overwhelmed sudden terrible calamity long ere recovers wonted elasticity 
aching void seems exist heart dead weight appears press upon brain ordinary objects make little impression soul seems turn inwards brood drearily upon

chapter xxii escape alone wilderness fight jaguar alligator martin encounters strange terrible creatures freedom fully appreciated long period deprived liberty 
impossible comprehend feelings joy welled martin bosom clambered rugged cliffs among found shelter looked round upon beautiful valley lying shadow mountain range behind sun set 
sat rock regardless wet condition clothes pondered long earnestly position still one danger sensation light hearted recklessness made prospect seem bright 
soon made mind 
weather extremely warm wringing water linen clothes experienced little discomfort felt would discomfort little danger traveling country without arms covering provisions 
therefore determined bold expedient revisiting indian village darkness night order procure required 
ran great risk retaken necessity urgent aware several families absent hunting expedition time whose huts pretty certain unoccupied 
accordingly two three hours night passed clambered much difficulty precipitous rock reached level plain quickly ran soon reached outskirts village 
indians asleep sound disturbed solemn stillness night 
going stealthily towards hut peeped open window could see hear nothing 
enter however long drawn breath proved occupied 
shrank hastily back deep shade bushes

looked steadily savage observed gaze one intense horror suddenly occurred indian supposed ghost acting upon supposition martin advanced face slowly towards indian put dark frown stood seconds without uttering word 
savage shrank back shuddered head foot 
noiseless step martin retreated slowly backward towards door passed like spectre never moment taking eyes savage lost darkness 
gaining forest fled beating heart former retreat fears groundless indian firmly believed martin spirit visited hut carried away provisions journey land spirits 
without waiting rest martin sooner reached scene adventurous leap fastened bag firmly shoulders struck across valley direction blue mountains hemmed 
four five hours hard walking brought base long rising sun shone upon recent home hills far away trudging onward weary foot light heart believed direction east coast brazil 
dare rest rugged peaks mountain range savages left far behind halted mid day breakfast repose margin delightfully cool mountain stream

kindled small fire martin kneaded large quantity farina hollow smooth stone baked number flat cakes soon fired spread upon ground 
thus engaged snake six feet long thick man arm glided past 
martin started convulsively never seen one kind knew bite snakes deadly 
fortunately axe hand 
grasping quickly killed reptile single blow 
two three mandioca cakes wild fruits draught water stream formed wanderer simple breakfast 
finished slung hammock two trees jumping fell deep untroubled slumber continued day daybreak following morning 
partaking hearty breakfast martin took bundle resumed travels 
day descended level wooded country succeeded mountain range night obliged encamp swampy place near stagnant lake several alligators swimming mosquitoes numerous found absolutely impossible sleep 
last despair sprang branches tree hammock slung ascended top 
satisfaction found scarcely mosquitoes cool breeze fanned fevered brow determined spend night tree 
binding several branches together formed rude sort couch lay comfortably placing knife bow beside using hammock rolled pillow 
sun setting leaned elbow looking leaves much interest alligators gambolled reedy lake attention attracted slight rustling bushes near foot tree 
looking perceived large jaguar gliding underwood cat like stealth 
martin observed huge alligator crawled lake lying bank asleep yards margin 
jaguar reached edge bushes paused one tremendous spring seized alligator soft part beneath tail 
huge monster struggled seconds endeavoring reach water lay still jaguar worried tore tough hide savage fury 
martin much surprised passive conduct alligator 
could turn stiff body catch jaguar jaws indeed surprise wondered much see great reptile suffer pain quietly

one loud splash water alligator powerful tail dashed foam one awful roar agony cut suddenly short stifled monster dived bottom prey silent grave ripples surface remained tell battle fought 
martin remained motionless tree top brooding fight witnessed deepening shadows warned time seek repose 
turning side laid head pillow soft breeze swayed tree gently fro rocked sound asleep 
thus day day week week martin rattler wander alone great forests sometimes pleasantly times less discomfort subsisting game shot arrows wild fruits 
met many strange adventures way would fill numerous volumes written every one must pass many silence may recount interesting

martin knew nothing fully expected dreadful creature would attack kill observed coarse tough looking hide thought slender arrows armed felt chance happen tree near time could climb 
energy despair let fly arrow force weak shaft glanced tapir side without slightest damage 
martin turned fly moment tapir great delight surprise 
wheeled round snort went crashing stout underwood grass leaving broad track behind 
another occasion met formidable looking comparatively harmless animal called great ant eater
