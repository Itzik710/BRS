began dragging bed flinging couch end studio 
afterwards took clean pair wardrobe began make bed deftness bachelor accustomed kind thing 
carefully tucked clothes side near wall shook pillows turned back corner coverlet

last several minutes spring mattress creaked became still 
comfortable mademoiselle asked claude much gentle voice 
yes monsieur comfortable replied scarcely audible voice still quivered emotion 
well 
good night 
good night 
blew candle silence became intense 
spite fatigue eyes soon opened gazed upward large window studio 
sky become clear stars twinkling sultry july night despite storm heat remained oppressive 
claude thinking girl agitated moment contrary feelings though last contempt gained mastery 
indeed believed strong minded imagined romance concocted destroy tranquillity gibed contentedly frustrated 
experience women slight nevertheless endeavored draw certain conclusions story told struck present certain petty details feeling perplexed 
worry brain matter whether told truth lie morning would go would end would never see 
thus claude lay cogitating towards daybreak stars began pale fell asleep 
girl behind screen spite crushing fatigue journey continued tossing uneasily oppressed heaviness atmosphere beneath hot zinc work roof doubtless rendered nervous strangeness surroundings 
morning claude awoke eyes kept blinking 
late sunshine streamed large window 
one theories young landscape painters take studios despised academical figure painters studios sun flooded living beams 
nevertheless felt dazzled fell back couch 
devil sleeping eyes still heavy sleep wandered mechanically round studio beside screen noticed heap petticoats 
remembered girl 
began listen heard sound long drawn regular breathing like child comfortably asleep 
ah still slumbering calmly would pity disturb 
felt dazed somewhat annoyed adventure however would spoil morning work 
got angry good nature would better shake might go 
nevertheless put trousers slippers softly walked tiptoes 
cuckoo clock struck nine claude made gesture annoyance 
nothing stirred regular breathing continued 
best thing thought would set work large picture would see breakfast later able move 
could make mind 
lived amid chronic disorder felt worried heap petticoats lying floor 
water dripped damp still 
grumbling low tone ended picking one one spreading chairs sunlight 
one ever seen like clothes thrown anyhow would never get dry would never go turned feminine apparel awkwardly got entangled black dress body went fours pick stockings fallen behind old canvas 
balbriggan stockings dark gray long fine examined hanging dry 
water oozing edge dress soaked wrung stretched warm hands order might able send away quicker 
since legs claude felt sorely tempted push aside screen take look guest 
self condemned curiosity increased bad temper 
last habitual shrug shoulders taking brushes heard words stammered amidst rustling bed clothes 
however soft breathing heard time yielded temptation dropping brushes peeping behind screen 
sight met eyes rooted spot fascinated muttered good gracious good gracious girl amidst hot house heat came window thrown back coverlet overcome fatigue restless night lay steeped flood sunshine unconscious everything 
feverish slumbers shoulder button become unfastened sleeve slipping allowed bosom seen skin looked almost gilded soft like satin 
right arm rested beneath neck head thrown back black unwound tresses enwrapped like dusky cloak 
good gracious beauty muttered claude 
every point figure vainly sought picture almost right pose 
rather spare perhaps lithe fresh 
light step claude ran take box crayons large sheet paper 
squatting low chair placed portfolio knees began sketch air perfect happiness 
else vanished amidst artistic surprise enthusiasm 
thought sex came 
mere question chaste outlines splendid flesh tints well set muscles 
face face nature uneasy mistrust powers made feel small squaring elbows became attentive respectful 
lasted quarter hour paused every blinking figure 
afraid however might change position speedily set work holding breath lest awaken 
yet steadily applying work vague fancies assailed mind 
could assuredly mere hussy 
told unbelievable tale thereupon began imagine stories 
perhaps lately arrived paris lover abandoned perhaps young woman middle classes led bad company female friend daring go home relatives else still intricate drama beneath something horrible inexplicable truth would never fathom 
hypotheses increased perplexity 
meanwhile went sketching face studying care 
whole upper part clear forehead smooth polished mirror small nose delicately chiselled nervous nostrils denoted great kindliness gentleness 
one divined sweet smile eyes beneath closed lids smile would light whole features 
unfortunately lower part face marred expression sweetness jaw prominent lips rather full showed almost blood like strong white teeth 
like flash passion something spoke awakening womanhood still unconscious amidst traits childlike softness 
suddenly shiver rippled girl satiny skin 
perhaps felt weight gaze thus mentally dissecting 
opened eyes wide uttered cry 
ah great heavens sudden terror paralysed sight strange room young man crouching shirt sleeves front devouring eyes 
flushing hotly impulsively pulled counterpane 
well matter cried claude angrily crayon suspended mid air wasp stung whose knowledge womankind largely limited professional models loss understand girl action 
neither spoke stirred remained counterpane tightly wrapped round throat body almost doubled scarcely showing outline beneath coverings 
eat urged claude 
come lie good girl 
blushed ears 
last stammered oh monsieur pray began lose temper altogether 
one angry fits subject coming upon 
thought obstinacy stupid

really kind put arm shall grateful grateful life long 
entreating pitifully waving crayon amid emotion artistic craving 
besides stirred remained crouching low chair distance bed 
last risked ordeal uncovered tranquillised face 
else could mercy looked wretchedly unhappy 
nevertheless still hesitated felt last scruples 
eventually without saying word slowly brought bare arm beneath coverings slipped head taking care however keep counterpane tightly round throat 
ah kind make haste free minute 
bent drawing looked glance painter simply regards woman model 
first became pink consciousness showing bare arm would shown ball room without thinking filled confusion 
nevertheless young man seemed reasonable became reassured 
blush left cheeks lips parted vague confiding smile 
half opened eyelids began study 
frightened previous night thick brown beard large head impulsive gestures 
yet ugly even detected great tenderness depths brown eyes nose altogether surprised 
finely cut woman nose almost lost amidst bristling hair lips 
shook slightly nervous anxiety made crayon seem living thing slender hand touched though knew 
felt sure bad natured rough surly ways arose bashfulness 
decipher clearly divined began put ease friend 
nevertheless studio continued frighten little 
cast sidelong glances around astonished much disorder carelessness 
stove cinders previous winter still lay heap 
besides bed small washstand couch furniture old dilapidated oaken wardrobe large deal table littered brushes colors dirty plates spirit lamp atop saucepan shreds vermicelli sticking sides 
rush bottomed chairs seats worse wear scattered beside spavined easels 
near couch candlestick used previous night stood floor looked swept fully month 
cuckoo clock huge one dial illuminated crimson flowers looked clean bright ticking sonorously 
especially frightened sketches oils hung frameless walls serried array sketches reaching floor mingled heaps canvases thrown anyhow 
never seen terrible painting coarse glaring showing violence color jarred upon nerves like carter oath heard doorstep inn 
cast eyes moment became attracted picture back turned 
large canvas painter working pushed wall every night better judge morrow surprise first glance 
could one wondered since dared even show meantime vast room sheet burning sunlight falling straight window panes unchecked blind spread flow molten gold broken furniture whose devil may care shabbiness threw bold relief 
claude began feel silence oppressive wanted say something matter first order polite especially divert attention pose 
cudgel brain would could think asking pray name opened eyes closed feeling sleepy

nearly two clock morning claude returned rue de douai 
week scouring paris anew time brought back feverish excitement day 
never returned late brain hot smoky 
christine overcome fatigue asleep lamp gone brow resting edge table 
viii last christine gave final stroke feather broom settled 
studio rue de douai small inconvenient one little room kitchen big cupboard attached 
obliged take meals studio live child always tumbling legs 
christine deal trouble making sticks suffice wished order save expense 
obliged buy second hand bedstead yielded temptation white muslin curtains cost seven sous metre 
den seemed charming began keep scrupulously clean resolving everything dispense servant living would difficult matter 
first months claude lived ever increasing excitement 
peregrinations noisy streets feverish discussions occasion visits friends rage burning ideas thus brought home doors made hold forth aloud even sleep 
paris seized hold full blaze furnace second youth enthusiastic ambition see conquer come upon 
never felt passion work hope sufficed stretch hand order create masterpieces set right rank first 
crossing paris discovered subjects pictures everywhere whole city streets squares bridges panoramas life suggested immense frescoes however always found small intoxicated thought something colossal 
thus returned home quivering brain seething projects evening threw sketches bits paper lamp light without able decide ought begin series grand productions dreamt 
one serious obstacle smallness studio 
old garret quai de bourbon even huge dining room bennecourt could oblong strip space kind passage landlord house impudently let painters four hundred francs year roofing glass worst sloping glazed roof looked north two high walls admitted greenish cellar like light 
therefore obliged postpone ambitious projects decided begin average sized canvases wisely saying dimensions picture proper test artist genius 
moment seemed favourable success courageous artist amidst breaking old schools would length bring originality sincerity work 
formulas recent times already shaken 
delacroix died without leaving disciples 
courbet barely clumsy imitators behind best pieces would merely become many museum pictures blackened age tokens art certain period 
seemed easy foresee new formula would spring rush sunshine limpid dawn rising new works nascent influence open air school 
undeniable light toned paintings people laughed much salon rejected secretly influencing many painters gradually brightening every palette 
nobody yet admitted first blow dealt evolution beginning became perceptible succeeding salon 
stroke would amidst unconscious copies impotent essayists amidst timid artful attempts tricksters master suddenly reveal giving body new formula dint audacity power without compromise showing substantial entire might become truth end century first hour passion hope claude usually harassed doubts believed genius 
longer experienced crises anguish driven days streets quest vanished courage 
fever stiffened worked blind obstinacy artist dives entrails drag therefrom fruit tortures 
long rest country endowed singular freshness visual perception joyous delight execution seemed born anew art endowed facility balance power never hitherto possessed 
also felt certain progress experienced great satisfaction successful bits work former sterile efforts last culminated 
said bennecourt got hold open air carolling gaiety tints astonished comrades came see 
admired convinced would show work take high place individuality style first time showing nature flooded real light amid play reflections constant variations colors 
thus three years claude struggled without weakening spurred efforts rebuff abandoning nought ideas marching straight vigor faith 
first year went forth amid december snows place four hours day behind heights montmartre corner patch waste land whence background painted miserable low tumble buildings overtopped factory chimneys whilst foreground amidst snow set girl ragged street rough devouring stolen apples 
obstinacy painting nature greatly complicated work gave rise almost insuperable difficulties 
however finished picture doors merely cleaned touched bit studio 
canvas placed beneath wan daylight glazed roof startled brutality 
showed like scene beheld doorway open street 
snow blinded one 
two figures muddy gray tint stood lamentable 
felt picture would accepted try soften sent salon 
swearing would never try exhibit held view one always present something hanging committee merely accentuate wrong 
besides admitted utility salon battlefield artist might come fore one stroke 
hanging committee refused picture 
second year claude sought contrast 
selected bit public garden batignolles may background large chestnut trees casting shade around corner greensward several six storied houses front seat crude green hue nurses petty cits neighborhood sat line watching three little girls making sand pies 
permission paint obtained needed heroism bring work successful issue amid bantering crowd 
last made mind go five morning order paint background reserving figures contented making mere sketches nature finishing studio 
time picture seemed less crude acquired wan softened light descended glass roof 
thought picture accepted friends pronounced masterpiece went saying would revolutionise salon 
stupefaction indignation fresh refusal hanging committee rumored 
committee intentions could denied question systematically strangling original artist 
first burst passion vented anger upon work stigmatised false dishonest execrable 
well deserved lesson remember ought relapsed cellar like studio light going revert filthy cooking imaginary figures picture came back took knife ripped top bottom 
third year obstinately toiled work revolt 
wanted blazing sun paris sun certain days turns pavement white heat dazzling reflection house frontages 
nowhere hotter even people burning climes mop faces would say region africa beneath heavily raining glow sky fire 
subject claude chose corner place du carrousel one clock afternoon sunrays fall vertically 
cab jolting along driver half asleep horse steaming drooping head vague amid throbbing heat 
passers seemed intoxicated one exception young woman rosy gay parasol walked easy queen like step fiery element proper sphere 
especially rendered picture terrible new interpretation effects light accurate decomposition sunrays ran counter habits eyesight emphasising blues yellows reds nobody accustomed see 
background tuileries vanished golden shimmer paving stones bled say figures many indications sombre patches eaten vivid glare 
time comrades still praising looked embarrassed seized apprehensions 
painting could lead martyrdom 
amidst praises understood well enough rupture taking place hanging committee closed salon dolorously exclaimed moment lucidity right understood thing die task 
however although obstinate courage seemed increase gradually relapsed former doubts consumed struggle waging nature 
every canvas came back seemed bad incomplete realizing aimed 
idea impotence exasperated even refusals hanging committee 
doubt forgive latter works even embryo state hundred times better trash accepted 
suffering felt ever unable show strength master piece could bring genius yield always superb bits paintings 
felt satisfied 
sudden voids inferior bits perceive work afterwards utterly killed picture like ineffaceable defects felt quite unable make corrections certain moments wall rose insuperable obstacle beyond forbidden venture 
touched part displeased score times score times aggravate evil till everything became quite muddled messy 
grew anxious failed see things clearly brush refused obey paralysed 
hands eyes ceased belong amid progressive attacks hereditary disorder already made anxious attacks became frequent lapsed horrible weeks wearing oscillating betwixt uncertainty hope support terrible hours spent desperate hand hand struggle rebellious work consoling dream future masterpiece one would last fully satisfied painting hands would show energy deftness true creative skill 
ever recurring phenomenon longing create outstripped quickness fingers never worked one picture without planning one follow 
remained eager desire rid work engaged brought torture doubt would good nothing still making fatal concessions recourse trickery everything true artist banish conscience 
meant ah meant beheld superb heroic attack indestructible 
everlasting mirage goads condemned disciples art falsehood comes spirit tenderness compassion without production would become impossible die failure create life 
addition constantly renewed struggles claude material difficulties increased 
enough could give birth felt existing within must also battle every day cares though refused admit painting nature open air became impossible picture beyond certain size 
could settle streets amidst crowd obtain person necessary number sittings sort painting must evidently confined certain determined subjects landscapes small corners city figures would many silhouettes painted afterwards 
also thousand one difficulties connected weather wind threatened carry easel rain obliged one interrupt one work 
days claude came home rage shaking fist sky accusing nature resisting order might take vanquish 
also complained bitterly poor dream movable studio vehicle paris boat seine would lived like artistic gipsy 
nothing came aid everything conspired work 
christine suffered claude 
shared hopes bravely brightening studio housewifely activity sat discouraged saw powerless 
picture refused displayed still deeper grief hurt womanly self love taking pride success women 
painter bitterness soured also entered feelings passions identified tastes defended painting become part one great concern lives indeed important one henceforth since one whence expected happiness 
understood well enough art robbed lover day real struggle art yet begun 
time yielded let carried away claude might one one self effort

christine already tried teach alphabet cried struggled decided wait another year two sending school masters would know make learn 
christine last began grow frightened prospect impending misery 
paris growing child beside living proved expensive end month became terrible despite efforts save every direction 
nothing certain claude thousand francs year could live fifty francs month left deducting four hundred francs rent first got embarrassment thanks sale pictures claude found gagniere old amateur one detested bourgeois possess ardent souls artists despite monomaniacal habits confined

one evening unable settle bill color shop painter exclaimed would live upon capital income rather lower degrading production trade pictures 
christine violently opposed extreme measure would retrench still short preferred anything madness would end throwing streets without even bread eat

accordingly resorted strength 
perfect small figures latter pictures claude many time already taken hint head pose arm attitude body christine

claude delighted first made study simple academic study attitude required picture 
waited jacques gone school sitting lasted hours 
earlier days christine suffered great deal obliged remain position grew used daring complain lest might vex even restraining tears roughly pushed 
soon acquired habit treating like mere model exacting however paid never afraid unduly taxing strength since wife 
employed every purpose every minute arm foot trifling detail stood need 
thus way lowered level living lay figure stuck front copied might copied pitcher stew pan bit still life 
time claude proceeded leisurely roughing large figure tired christine months making pose twenty different ways 
last one day began roughing 
autumnal morning north wind already sharp means warm even big studio although stove roaring 
little jacques poorly unable go school decided lock room back telling good 
mother settled near stove motionless attitude required 
first hour painter perched upon steps kept glancing speak word 
unutterable sadness stole felt afraid fainting longer knowing whether suffering cold despair come afar bitterness felt rising within 
fatigue became great staggered hobbled numbed legs 
already cried claude 
quarter hour 
want earn seven francs joking gruff voice delighted work 
scarcely recovered use limbs beneath dressing gown wrapped round went shouting come come idling grand day day must either show genius else kick bucket 
weary way last resumed pose 
misfortune long glances language used fully realized nothing 
ever praised limb tint contor solely artistic point view

felt confused deeply mortified 
ah end longer loved aught art example nature life eyes gazing space would remain rigid like statue keeping back tears made heart swell lacking even wretched consolation able cry 
day day sorry life began afresh

happy life seemed three people place claude introduced mistress woman painting

husband canvases became magnified eyes smallest assumed triumphal dimensions even worst painted overwhelmed victory longer judged grovelled trembling thinking formidable invariably replying claude questions oh yes good oh superb oh extraordinary one nevertheless harboured anger still worshipped tearful tenderness saw thus consume efforts 
weeks successful work everything got spoilt could finish large female figure 
times almost killed model fatigue keeping hard work days days together leaving picture untouched whole month 
figure begun anew relinquished painted least dozen times 
one year two years went without picture reaching completion 
though sometimes almost finished scratched next morning painted entirely 
ah effort creation effort blood tears filling claude agony attempt beget flesh instil life ever battling reality ever beaten struggle angel 
wearing impossible task making canvas hold nature became exhausted last pains racked muscles without ever able bring genius fruition 
others satisfied less faithful rendering various necessary bits trickery filled remorse made indignant resorting practices one guilty ignoble cowardice thus began work spoiling good craving better

lacking power could endow life little doubt 
sometimes went beyond right point sometimes stopped short 
one day words incomplete genius overheard flattered frightened

even wife dared question return indeed happy see back anxious waiting 
times madly scoured paris especially outlying quarters longing debase hob nob labourers

happiness consist solid limbs performing work one built well quickly wrecked life ought got engaged building line old times lunched dog montargis gomard tavern known limousin big strapping merry fellow whose brawny arms envied 
coming back rue tourlaque legs faint head empty gave picture much distressful frightened glance one casts corpse mortuary fresh hope resuscitating endowing life brought flush face 
one day christine posing figure woman well nigh finished 
last hour however claude growing gloomy losing childish delight displayed beginning sitting 
wife scarcely dared breathe feeling discomfort everything must going wrong afraid might accelerate catastrophe moved much finger 
surely enough suddenly gave cry anguish launched forth oath thunderous voice 
oh curse curse flung handful brushes top steps 
blinded rage one blow fist transpierced canvas 
christine held trembling hands 
dear dear flung dressing gown shoulders approached picture experienced keen delight burst satisfied hatred 
claude fist struck one full bosom gaping hole last one killed motionless horror struck murder claude stared perforated bosom 
poignant grief came upon sight wound whence blood work seemed flow 
possible thus murdered loved best earth anger changed stupor fingers wandered canvas drawing ragged edges rent together wished close bleeding gash 
choking stammered distracted boundless grief killed killed christine maternal love big child artist felt moved entrails 
forgave usual 
saw well enough one thought mend rent repair evil helped held shreds together whilst behind glued strip canvas 
dressed one immortal simply retaining near heart slight scar seemed make doubly dear painter 
unhinging claude faculties increased drifted sort superstition devout belief certain processes methods 
banished oil colors spoke personal enemy 
hand held turpentine produced solid unpolished surface secrets hid everybody solutions amber liquefied copal resinous compounds made colors dry quickly prevented cracking 
experienced terrible worries absorbent nature canvas sucked little oil contained paint 
question brushes always worried greatly insisted special handles objecting sable used nothing oven dried badger hair 
important however everything else question palette knives like courbet used backgrounds 
quite collection long flexible others broad squat one triangular like glazier expressly made 
real delacroix knife 
besides never made use scraper razor considered beneath artist dignity 
hand indulged sorts mysterious practices applying colors concocted recipes changed every month suddenly fancied bit right system painting repudiating oil flow began lay successive touches arrived exact tone required 
one fads long paint right left without confessing much felt sure brought luck 
terrible affair unhinged invading theory respecting complementary colors 
gagniere first speak subject equally inclined technical speculation 
claude impelled exuberance passion took exaggerating scientific principles whereby three primitive colors yellow red blue one derives three secondary ones orange green violet whole series complementary similar hues whose composites obtained mathematically one another 
thus science entered painting method logical observation already 
one take predominating hue picture note complementary similar colors establish experimentally variations would occur instance red would turn yellowish near blue whole landscape would change tint refractions decomposition light according clouds passing 
claude accurately came conclusion objects real fixed color assume various hues according ambient circumstances misfortune took direct observation brain throbbing scientific formulas prejudiced vision lent much force delicate shades made render theoretically correct vivid manner thus style bright full palpitation sunlight ended reversal everything eye accustomed giving instance flesh violet tinge tricoloured skies 
insanity seemed end 
poverty finished claude
