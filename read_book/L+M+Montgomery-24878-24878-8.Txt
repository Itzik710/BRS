brave woman indeed look upon prospect unquailingly brave 
weak timid 
father often laughed mockingly three weeks since father died proud handsome unrelenting old father loved intensely never loved 
always accepted fact unresentfully unquestioningly steeped whole life tincture bitterness

next sunday looked across church fraser pew saw young man met wood 
looking arms folded breast brow little frown seemed somehow indicative pain surprise 
felt miserable sense disappointment 
frasers guest could expect meet 
father hated frasers shirleys hated old feud bitter lasting much inheritance generations land money
