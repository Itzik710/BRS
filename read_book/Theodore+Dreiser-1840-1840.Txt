nevertheless since desired money tied old warrants redeemable lack funds paid way could done would broker knew subtleties stock market handle new city loan change way would made seem worth one hundred sold outsiders figure 
afterward certain fell politicians could buy much pleased eventually city redeem par 
george w stener entering city treasurer time bringing special financial intelligence proposition really troubled 
henry mollenhauer one men gathered large amount old city warrants wanted money order invest bonanza offers west called stener also mayor 
simpson butler made big three 
think something ought done warrants outstanding explained 
carrying large amount others 
helped city long time saying nothing think something ought done 
mr butler mr simpson feel way 
new loan certificates listed stock exchange money raised way clever broker could bring par 
stener greatly flattered visit mollenhauer 
rarely trouble put personal appearance weight effect presence would 
called mayor president council much called stener lofty distant inscrutable air 
office boys 
order understand exactly motive mollenhauer interest stener significance visit stener subsequent action regard necessary scan political horizon little distance back 
although george w stener way political henchman appointee mollenhauer latter vaguely acquainted 
seen knew agreed name put local slate largely assured closest bidding stener right would told would cause one trouble etc 
fact several previous administrations mollenhauer maintained subsurface connection treasury never close one could easily traced 
conspicuous man politically financially 
plan simpson butler shared using political commercial stool pigeons bleed city treasury much possible without creating scandal 
fact years previous various agents already employed edward strobik president council asa conklin incumbent mayor chair thomas wycroft alderman jacob harmon alderman others organize dummy companies various names whose business deal things city needed lumber stone steel iron cement long list course always fat profit ultimately behind dummy companies organized 
saved city trouble looking far wide honest reasonable dealers 
since action least three dummies something development cowperwood story may briefly described 
edward strobik chief one useful mollenhauer minor way spry person thirty five time lean somewhat forceful black hair black eyes inordinately large black mustache 
dapper inclined noticeable clothing pair striped trousers white vest black cutaway coat high silk hat 
markedly ornamental shoes always polished perfection immaculate appearance gave nickname dude among 
nevertheless quite able small scale well liked many 
two closest associates messrs thomas wycroft jacob harmon rather less attractive less brilliant 
jacob harmon thick wit socially fool financially 
big rather doleful look upon sandy brown hair brown eyes fairly intelligent absolutely willing approve anything broad crookedness would afford sufficient protection keep clutches law 
really cunning dull anxious get along 
thomas wycroft last useful minor triumvirate tall lean man candle waxy hollow eyed gaunt face pathetic look physically shrewd 
iron molder trade gotten politics much stener useful managed make money via triumvirate strobik ringleader engaged various peculiar businesses indicated 
companies several henchmen organized previous administrations mollenhauer dealt meat building material lamp posts highway supplies anything city departments institutions needed 
city contract awarded irrevocable certain councilmen fixed advance took money 
company organized need actually slaughter cattle mold lamp posts 
organize obtain charter secure contract supplying material city city council strobik harmon wycroft would attend sublet actual beef slaughterer iron founder would supply material allow pocket profit turn divided paid mollenhauer simpson form political donations clubs organizations 
easy way legitimate 
particular beef slaughterer iron founder thus favored could hope ability thus obtain contract 
stener whoever charge city treasury time services loaning money low rate interest used surety proper performance contract aid instances beef killer iron founder carry end allowed one two per cent 
might pocket treasurers fair proportion profits 
complacent confidential chief clerk right would recommended 
concern stener strobik harmon wycroft acting mollenhauer incidentally planning use little money loaned purposes quite outside indicated 
business loan 
however going 
time even nominated stener learned strobik way one sureties treasurer suretyship law councilmen wycroft harmon law pennsylvania stipulating one political servant might become surety another brought nomination election would means ask anything perfectly legal must complacent stand way big municipal perquisites bite hands fed 
also made perfectly plain well office little money made

seen dabbled politics extent heretofore well financially indeed pegged along insurance real estate agent 
worked hard small political henchman 
politicians building nice homes newer portions city 
going new york harrisburg washington jaunting parties

naturally promised something interested compliant 
might get came visit mollenhauer suggestion regard bringing city loan par although bore obvious relation mollenhauer subsurface connection stener strobik others stener definitely recognize political subservience master stentorian voice immediately thereafter hurried strobik information 
would asked strobik knew mollenhauer visit stener told waiting stener speak 
mr mollenhauer talks new loan listed change brought par sell one hundred 
neither strobik harmon wycroft knew certificates city loan worth ninety open market made sell one hundred change mollenhauer secretary one abner sengstack suggested strobik since butler dealing young cowperwood mollenhauer care particularly private broker instance might well try cowperwood 
cowperwood called stener office 
yet recognizing either hand mollenhauer simpson merely looked peculiarly shambling heavy cheeked middle class man without either interest sympathy realizing financial baby deal 
could act adviser man sole counsel four years mr stener said soft ingratiating voice latter held hand 
glad meet 
heard course 
stener long explaining cowperwood difficulty 
went clumsy fashion stumbling difficulties situation suffered meet 
main thing see make certificates sell par

want get enough clear away two hundred thousand dollars worth outstanding warrants much get later 
cowperwood felt like physician feeling patient pulse patient really sick reassurance means fat fee

wisely enough sensed politics shrewder bigger men behind stener 
slyly shrewdly sending stener

might mean tell like mr stener said listened explanation asked much city loan would like sell coming year 
glad undertake

chapter xv plan cowperwood developed days meditation plain enough one knows anything commercial financial manipulation dark secret 
first place city treasurer use cowperwood office bank deposit 
turn actually set credit city books subject order certain amounts city loans two hundred thousand dollars first since amount desired raise quickly would go market see could done brought par 
city treasurer ask leave stock exchange listed security 
cowperwood would use influence application acted upon quickly 
stener dispose city loan certificates 
allow buy sinking fund supposedly amounts might buy order keep price par 
considerable number loan certificates unloaded public might necessary buy back great deal 
however would sold 
law concerning selling par would abrogated extent ie wash sales preliminary sales would considered sales par reached 
subtle advantage cowperwood pointed stener 
first place since certificates going ultimately reach par anyway objection stener one else buying low opening price holding rise 
cowperwood would glad carry books amount would settle end month 
would asked buy certificates outright 
could carried books certain reasonable margin say ten points 
money good made stener 
next place buying sinking fund would possible buy certificates cheap new reserve issue entirely hands cowperwood could throw amounts wished market times wished buy consequently depress market 
could buy later would go price 
issues totally hands boost depress market wished reason city ultimately get par issues time considerable money made manufactured fluctuations 
cowperwood would glad make profit way 
city allow normal percentage actual sales certificates city par would order keep straight stock exchange beyond necessary manipulative sales would many would depend knowledge stock market reimburse

understanding score 
thought matter would decided want outsider interfere 
matter fact street railway business philadelphia sufficiently developed time suggest one grand scheme union came later 
yet connection new arrangement stener cowperwood strobik came forward stener idea 
certain make money cowperwood stener especially 
amiss therefore stener cowperwood rather stener secret representative since strobik dare appear matter buying sufficient street railway shares one line control strobik could efforts get city council set aside certain streets extension would 
later proposed shake stener could 
preliminary work done one might well stener 
time saw work done carefully naturally superiors watchful found dabbling affairs kind advantage might make impossible continue politically position could help 
outside organization street railway company already existence right appeal city council privileges would naturally city growth things equal could refused 
would appear however shareholder president council 
cowperwood acting privately stener would another thing 
interesting thing proposition finally presented stener strobik cowperwood raised without appearing whole question cowperwood attitude toward city administration 
although dealing privately edward butler agent plan mind although never met either mollenhauer simpson nevertheless felt far manipulation city loan concerned acting 
hand matter private street railway purchase stener brought realized beginning stener attitude something untoward stener felt something ought 
cowperwood said first morning ever broached matter stener office old city hall sixth chestnut stener view oncoming prosperity feeling good indeed street railway property around town man could buy get control sufficient money cowperwood knew properties 
alert mind long since sensed general opportunities 
omnibuses slowly disappearing 
best routes already preempted 
still streets city growing 
incoming population would make great business future 
one could afford pay almost price short lines already built one could wait extend lines larger better areas later 
already conceived mind theory endless chain argeeable formula later termed buying certain property long time payment issuing stocks bonds sufficient pay seller reimburse trouble say nothing giving margin wherewith invest things allied properties instance bonds could issued ad infinitum 
became old story later new time kept thought closely 
none less glad stener speak since street railways hobby convinced would great master ever opportunity control 
yes george said noncommittally two three offer good chance man money enough 
notice blocks stock offered change one person another 
would good policy pick things offered see later stockholders want sell 
green coates looks like good proposition

mentioned one line might secured way course time 
stener meditated 
good deal money said thoughtfully 
talk later 
see strobik none less 
cowperwood knew stener two three hundred thousand dollars invest anything 
one way could get borrow city treasury forego interest 
would initiative 
one else must behind else mollenhauer simpson possibly even butler though doubted unless triumvirate secretly working together 
larger politicians always using treasury thinking attitude regard use money 
harm could come stener ventures successful reason 
even would merely acting agent

one line laid within blocks new home seventeenth nineteenth street line called interested greatly 
rode occasionally delayed wish trouble vehicle 
ran two thriving streets red brick houses destined great future city grew large enough

politically could get anything 
butler philanthropist
