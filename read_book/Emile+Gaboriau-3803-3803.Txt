called loving daughter second meeting last 
gaston dared trust boatman obliged walk league order cross bridge 
thought would shorter swim river could swim well cross rhone ran rapidly rash skilful swimmers 
one evening however valentine startled seeing rise water feet 
made promise never attempt exploit 
repeated feat promise next evening every successive evening 
valentine always imagined drowned furious current agreed upon signal 
moment starting gaston would put light window clameran fifteen minutes would idol feet 
projects hopes lovers alas projected nothing hoped nothing 
blindly thoughtlessly almost fearlessly abandoned dangerous happiness daily rendezvous regardless storm must erelong burst devoted heads revelled present bliss 
every sincere passion thus passion subsists upon things ought extinguish absence obstacles make burn fiercely 
exclusive undisturbed reflects neither past future excepting present sees cares nothing 
moreover valentine gaston believed everyone ignorant secret 
always cautious kept strict watch flattered conduct masterpiece dissimulation prudence 
valentine fixed upon hour certain mother would miss 
gaston never confided anyone even brother louis 
never breathed name 
denied last sweet word last kiss felt would safe 
poor blind lovers anything could concealed idle curiosity country gossips slanderous ever watchful enemies incessantly lookout new bit tittle tattle good bad improve upon eagerly spread far near 
believed secret well kept whereas long since made public story love particulars rendezvous topics conversation throughout neighborhood 
sometimes dusk would see bark gliding along water near shore would say belated fisherman returning home
