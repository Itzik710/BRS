irish peasant reduced pauperism seldom commences melancholy task soliciting alms native place 
trial always severe one anxious hide shame misery eyes know 
one reason system poor laws introduced country 
paupers description become burden upon strangers whilst capable entering friendly sympathy misfortunes opportunity assisting 
indeed shame seeking alms known mendicant better days proof absence poor laws takes away poorer classes one strongest incitements industry instance every pauper ireland confined parish compelled beg acquaintances sense shame alone would stirring greater industry reduce number mendicants one half

indeed astonishing man moment hesitate form opinion upon subject poor laws 
english scotch gentry know something middle lower classes respective countries course fixed system provision poor 
ignorance irish gentry upon almost every subject connected real good people keeping ignorance people 
feared however disinclination introduce poor laws arises less actual ignorance illiberal selfishness 
facts case ireland whole support inconceivable multitude paupers swarm like locusts surface country rests upon middle lower classes rather upon latter scarcely thing unhappy country middle class

beggars ever think applying 
know honor dogs would slipped whip might laid perhaps shoulders broken hearted father brood helpless children wanting food perhaps upon emaciated person miserable widow begs orphans hands supported would defended mouldered dust 
upon middle lower classes therefore comes directly heavy burden supporting great mass pauperism presses upon ireland 
certain irish landlords know reluctant see law enacted might make performance duties poor compulsory 
indeed natural men inhumanly neglected 
must state country way pauperism exclusively burdened support vagrant poor like putting additional weight man already sinking burden bears 
landlords suppose maintenance idle able aged infirm able work comes upon renters land exempted support

two circumstances connected pauperism ireland worthy notice 
first roman catholics certainly constitute bulk population feel called upon peculiar tenets religion exercise indiscriminate charity largely begging poor 
act impression eleemosynary good works possess power canceling sin extent almost incredible

thry plan good thry anything could take us disgraceful life 
humble speculation source great comfort 
many time forgotten sorrows contemplating simple picture happy little cottage 
kathleen particular drew vivid coloring tender mother affectionate wife various sources comfort contentment found even cabin whose inmates blessed love independence industry mutual affection 
owen pursuance intention neglect proper season arrived place eldest children among farmers

therefore little trouble obtaining wishes point great satisfaction saw three hired earn support

plan likely one owen bent earning bread rather burthen others unnecessary say succeeded 
less year found home force felt sitting first time since pauperism hearth may easily conceived reader 
years owen got slowly enough wages daily laborer miserable required exert every nerve keep house head 
however carefulness virtuous determination joined indefatigable industry time backed wife even youngest children found beginning improve 
mornings evenings cultivated garden rood potato ground 
also collected wheelbarrow borrowed acquaintance compost neighboring road scoured old drain door dug rich earth tossed pool rotten water beside house fact adopted several modes collecting manure 
means spring large portion rich stuff plant potatoes 
landlord permitted spread planting upon land owen ere long instead rood able plant half acre ultimately acre potatoes 
produce sufficient consumption family sold surplus money gained sale enabled sow half acre oats made meal disposed greater share

owen selling meal much potatoes could spare found able purchase cow

contrary laid shoulders together phrase proved world proper disposition followed suitable energy perseverance must generally reward possesses 
certainly true owen situation life essentially different latter years struggles farmer 
much favorable far better calculated develop successful exertion 
class men deserving public sympathy small farmers ireland 
circumstances fraught calculated depress ruin rents far ability increasing poverty bad markets 
land last war might enabled renter pay three pounds per acre yet still maintain tolerable comfort could pay one pound one pound ten yet infatuation landlords instances terms leases taken rigorously exacted 
neither remission yearly arrears said strike root evils suffer 
fact disproportionate rent hanging disheartening circumstance paralyzes exertion sinks spirits 
landlord remit rent one term deals harshly tenant next whatever surplus former indulgence leaves tenant hands instead expended upon property capital permitted lay foundation hope prosperity drawn next term poor struggling tenant thrown back much distress embarrassment despondency ever 
believe tenants ireland class allude one gale three arrear 
expected men labor spirit earnestness raise crops may never reap crops landlord may seize upon secure much rent

consequence tenant looked upon negligent man scarcely rent could got took courage worked farm spirit success evinced ere long capacity pay gales day judicious humane landlord finally gainer excellent economy 
experiment succeeded beyond expectation 
owen carthy work zeal ability humble cotter farmer tide landholder instead advanced actually lost ground became pauper 
doubt peculiarly unfavorable run two hard seasons darkened sickness famine formidable obstacles must eventually failed even occurred 
accelerated downfall cause 
irish people though poor exceedingly anxious independent 
highest ambition hold farm 
strong principle without single penny capital visible means rely without consideration forethought come forward offer rent reflected moment must feel unreasonably high 
indeed great evil ireland 
meantime must think imprudent landlords imprudent agents let land persons without proper inquiry means knowledge agriculture general character moral industrious men farm land let advertised parish application made day 
day arrives agent land steward looks proposals singling highest bidder declares tenant matter course 
perhaps said tenant possess shilling world shilling worth 
likely new married man nothing wife bed bedding wedding suit blackthorn cudgel may suppose keep reserve bailiff 
however commences farm follow shiftings scramblings fruitless struggles succeed success impossible 
farm half tilled crops miserable gale day already passed yet pay nothing takes land 
perhaps runs away makes moonlight flitting aid friends succeeds bringing crop 
landlord agent declares knave forgetting man alternative greater knaves fools encouraging undertake task beyond strength 
calamity anxious derive support sympathy friends success eager communicate power participating happiness 
owen found independent safe longed realize two plans time seriously thinking 
first visit former neighbors might length know owen mccarthy station world became character 
second possible take farm native parish might close days among companions youth friends maturer years 
also another motive lay burying place carthys slept mouldering dust golden haired alley

fortunate art followed brother judgment selecting trade 
frank said notwithstanding coldness manner means deficient feeling affection possessed however power suppressing external manifestations circumstance unfrequently occasioned happen want feeling often imputed without cause

art extremely well tempered frank also impossible two brothers could agree better live harmony 
truth almost succeeded opening art eyes weak points character especially greatest dangerous vanity insatiable appetite praise

frank maguire health hip hip hurra thus fine generous minded affectionate young man possessed candor absence suspicion characterize truth tempted triumphed partly warmth affections set low cunning profligates felt anxious drag moral superiority felt possessed 
vain fond praise knew readers may also perceive unfortunate vanity gave first advantage bringing influence among 
late night carried home door state unconscious intoxication 
utterly beyond power describe harrowing state sensations awakening next morning 
abasement repentance remorse combined within fall far short felt degraded eyes deprived self respect stripped every claim confidence brother well known character integrity inseparable name 
however pressed upon intense bitterness appalling reflection could longer depend upon put trust resolutions 
use world without power abiding decisions none yet done could live world wherever went temptations would beset 
beloved margaret murray make wife common drunkard suspect pledged giving away heart affections poor unmanly sot sense firmness keep sober felt state distraction despair putting hands face wept bitterly 
complete picture veins still throbbed dry fever follows intoxication stomach state deadly sickness loathing head felt exactly would burst fly asunder 
alas natural character properly understood judiciously managed early taught understand control obvious errors necessity self reliance firmness independence taught principles enfeebled foolish praise family vanity inflated senseless appeals possible nay almost certain would even stage life completely free failings beginning even undermine whole strength moral constitution 
frank interview occasion short significant art said know never man many words goin turn new lafe 
scould intention listen promises 
say broken word disgraced name 
put neither confidence trust longer neither single tear visible cheek passed room art violent sobs quite audible 
indeed truth must told frank distress nearly equal brother however done ill attend business circumstance heightened distress knew difficult task encountering master would enjoy remorse still even less difficult borne scourge reflections 
length thought occurred appeared give relief thought felt remained clear could longer depend necessary find something else depend 
accordingly sent intimation master wished minutes conversation could spare time carroll accordingly came found state excited worthy man compassion 
well art said wish speak hear drunk last night 
thought sense let fellows put pickle 
fine well conducted set men general among hardened hackneyed crew good workmen care curse either anybody else 
always sure employment least elsewhere indeed anywhere 
fault replied art altogether opposed drinkin especially knew promised frank never get drunk agin 
syl harte proposed frank health drank whiskey spite 
syl harte said master smile ay thinkin well matter art strength resolution like 
curse sir replied young man neither one account sent 
art said goin bind goin swear make short work fraid one might prevent blessed proceeded presence god swear upon blessed manwil manual drop spirituous drink liquor kind cross lips next seven years barrin may necessary medicine kissed book three times blessed sat considerably relieved 
added may tell done seven years freedom thank god slave whiskey greatest tyrants wealth europe 
worst art replied ister exceedingly shrewd man whiskey makes man tyrant slave time greatest tyrant ever lived yet 
fit work day think ought take stretch across country walk consequence debauch fellows last night 
art felt confidence relief obtained precise aid stood need 
danger prop placed feeble resolution could depend safety could tampering temptation matter clear explicit decisive far right said conscience felt relieved weighty burden 
brother hearing lips said little yet little discourage rather approved otherwise avoided expressing decided opinion one way 
pity said want common resolution drive man take oath tried strength little farther art knows might gained victory without would creditable manly swearin still temptation drink great people prevents possibility fallin 
art never dealt thing disingenuous slow credit duplicity others suspect profligates played trick rather annoy brother 
nothing discreditable triumph cunning debased minds inexperience vanity one whatever foibles might would scorn take ungenerous advantage confidence reposed consequence good opinion friendly feeling 
period apprenticeship however elapsed day length arrived departure corner house 
master may add friend solicited stop still journeymen different object view declined 
art proposed set indeed natural one whose affections long engaged wish little delay possible see possessed home might bring betrothed wife 
frank trusted chance relied merely upon vague projects like brother time previous close apprenticeship quietly negotiating formation partnership carpenter wanted steady man helm 
man capital clever enough way illiterate utterly without method conducting affairs frank therefore identical description person stood need integrity family well known integrity felt anxious preserve without speck course little obstruction way coming terms 
morning day left establishment carroll came workshop bidding farewell companions lived abating three four pranks played upon art good friendly terms seeing take departure addressed follows need say proceeded regret leaving without meaning disrespect present bound acknowledge two better workmen two honester young men never employment 
art indeed unsurpassed considering time closing apprenticeship tis true good opportunities opportunities happy say never neglected 
habit know addressing words advice young men close apprenticeships entering upon world 
therefore lay simple rules guidance perhaps following find neither worse poorer men 
let first principle life mechanics men truth truth think say fail procure approbation world fail procure better god 
let next principle industry honest fair legitimate industry ought annex punctuality industry without punctuality half virtue 
let third great principle sobriety strict undeviating sobriety mechanic without sobriety far benefit ornament society ought curse disgrace within limits sobriety rational enjoyments life comprised without found desolate society crime indigence sickness death 
maintaining sobriety world especially among persons class certainly much contend remember firmness character acting upon right feeling good sense enable maintain work every virtuous laudable purpose propose effect 
therefore suffer shamed sobriety indeed moral duty force ridicule neither hand must seduced flattery transient gratification social enjoyment 
fact little add become members society assume distinctly duties imposes 
discharge faithfully break words keep promises respect remember self respect different thing pride empty overweening vanity self respect fact altogether incompatible like opposite qualities abide individual 
let impress principles must honorably succeed life succeed neglecting must assuredly fail 
tis true knavery dishonesty often successful exercise fraudulent practices certain never think carrying business life consequently dismiss point altogether unsuitable either 
add hope sincerely observe simple truths laid trust ere many years pass may live see respectable useful independent members society 
farewell may wish whether little code useful doctrine equally observed appear course narrative
