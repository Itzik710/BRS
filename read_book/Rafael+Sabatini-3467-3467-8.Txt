mystery precise respective ages vannozza two eldest sons fear time day become impossible establish beyond reasonable doubt firstborn spite documents discovered gregorovius assertion remove doubt enable definitely assert giovanni born cesare 
let us look documents 
letters ambassadors masters probably correct credible since happen agree corroborate one another still utterly absolutely reliable suffice remove doubts engendered less reliable documents whose evidence contradicts 
first letters quoted gregorovius ambassador gianandrea boccaccio master duke ferrara 
mentions cesare borgia sixteen seventeen years age time 
manner writing sixteen seventeen years common way vaguely suggesting age rather positively stating 
may pass evidence secondary importance 
next letter gerardo saraceni duke ferrara dated october valuable claiming relation something holiness told writer 
post scriptum ambassador says pope gave understand said duchess lucrezia borgia complete twenty two years age next april time duke romagna complete twenty sixth year 
facendomi intendere epsa duchessa di et di anni ventidui li quali finiranno questo aprile el qual tempo anche lo illmo 
duca di romagna fornir anni ventisei 
certainly fixes year cesare birth remember saraceni speaking something pope recently told exactly recently transpire 
error would easily possible far age cesare concerned 
far age lucrezia concerned error possible actually committed saraceni 
least age given letter wrong one year know legal document drawn february lucrezia contract marriage juan cherubin de centelles 
contract never executed 
according protocol old spanish dated february lucrezia completed twelfth year april definitely positively gives us date birth april 
item mes attenent que dita dona lucretia xviiii de abril prop 
vinent entrar edat de dotze anys 
quite extraordinary error made gregorovius says lucrezia borgia born april extraordinary considering made apparently protocol eyes cites fact document iv appendix lucrezia borgia authority 
return however cesare giovanni yet another evidence quoted gregorovius support contention latter elder born nature less value already mentioned 
worthy consideration view greater official legal character ossuna documents given supplement appendix thuasne edition burchard diary namely october

variance two gives us year birth 
evidences conflicting may added burchard mention diary date september cesare seventeen years age 
would make born 
clearly matter definitely settled upon evidence 
positively assert born years think better purposes story assume birth year 
know years one born giovanni borgia confusion prevails regard exact age impossible determine finality whether cesare junior senior

two chief aims alexander vi beginning pontificate establish power church despised temporal states italy promote fortune children 
already day coronation conferred upon cesare bishopric valencia whose revenues amounted annual yield sixteen thousand ducats 
time however hands full matters behoved move slowly first extremest caution 
clouds war lowering heavily italy alexander came st peter throne first concern find safe position coming threatening storm 
chief menace general peace lodovico maria sforza surnamed il moro sat regent nephew duke gian galeazzo upon throne milan 
regency usurped gian galeazzo mother fair way usurp throne 
kept nephew virtually prisoner castle pavia together young bride isabella aragon sent thither father duke calabria heir crown naples 
touching lodovico maria name il moro generally translated moor whilst one writer found mentioned black lodovico benedetto varchi explanation storia fiorentina may interest 
tells us lodovico called account swarthiness complexion supposed guicciardini contrary fair yet account device showing moorish squire brush hand dusts gown young woman regal apparel motto per italia nettar ogni bruttura device moor tells us r bus pun upon word moro also means mulberry meant lodovico 
mulberry burgeons end winter blossoms early 
thus lodovico symbolized prudence readiness seize opportunity betimes 
gian galeazzo thus bestowed lodovico maria went calmly business governing like one mean relinquish regency save become duke 
happened boy born young prisoners pavia whereupon spurred perhaps activity parenthood stimulated thought son interests fight well made appeal king ferrante naples enforce grandson law rights throne milan 
king ferrante could desire nothing better grandchild husband reigned milan favor contriving great influence north italy 
therefore stood friend 
matters stage alexander vi ascended papal throne 
election gave ferrante pause seen schemed pope devoted interests would stand coming strife schemes rudely shaken 
whilst still cogitating matter next move wretched francesco cibo pope innocent son offered sell papal fiefs cervetri anguillara made father gentile orsini head powerful house 
gentile purchased contract signed palace cardinal giuliano della rovere september sum forty thousand ducats advanced ferrante 
alexander protested strongly illegal transaction cervetri anguillara fiefs church neither cibo right sell orsini right buy 
moreover hands powerful vassal naples orsini suited pope little suited lodovico maria sforza 
stirred latter taking measures move feared ferrante might make enforce gian galeazzo claims 
lodovico maria went sly shrewdness characteristic well symbolized mulberry badge humorous shrewdness almost makes one delightful rogues history one debonair cultured 
may indeed considered one types subtle crafty selfish politician ideal macchiavelli 
see effacing tight lipped cunning smile comely face pointing venice grave sober countenance little suit neapolitan spaniards ruffling north must happen ferrante way milan 
truth obvious venice made haste enter league camp thus formed came sakes mantua ferrara siena 
league powerful enough thus cause ferrante think twice took cudgels gian galeazzo 
lodovico could include pope league might would paralysing ferrante would cease think grandchildren affairs 
foreseeing ferrante perforce dry tears guicciardini shed replacing smile servile obsequious repaired hat hand protest friendship pope holiness 
december came prince altamura ferrante second son rome lay father homage feet pontiff time implore holiness refuse king hungary dispensation latter asking holy see enable repudiate wife donna leonora ferrante daughter

holy father means anxious friendship old wolf naples 
matter king hungary one required consideration meanwhile may hinted slyly naples rome little matter two fiefs adjusted 
thus shrewd holiness thought gain little time time might look consider alliances would suit interests best 
cardinal della rovere high dudgeon flung rome away castle ostia fortify wield sword st paul since missed keys st peter

foresaw injured dignity spanish house naples ferrante wrath pope light treatment apathy interests cardinal knew ferrante allied mighty houses colonna orsini 
thus political divorcement holy see flung lot hoping red war deposition alexander

alexander went calmly business fortifying vatican castle sant angelo gathering mercenaries service 
lest attempt made upon life went abroad imposing escort men arms vexed fretted king ferrante omit comment upon scathing terms letter presently shall consider 
rest pope holiness preserved unruffled front face hostile preparations toward kingdom naples knowing could check chose lift finger beckon sforza alliance 
presently naples heard alarming rumor lodovico maria fact made overtures pope pope met advances extent betrothing daughter lucrezia giovanni sforza lord pesaro cousin lodovico 
back vatican went neapolitan envoys definite proposals alliance cemented marriage giuffredo borgia aged twelve ferrante granddaughter lucrezia aragon 
pope plans half matured yet temporized evasive continued arm recruit

thus ferrante man whose friendship seeking six weeks earlier rejected advances

sanuto quotes letter rome july states certain ascanio murdered duke gandia 
cardinal ascanio numerous enemies took care keep accusation alive vatican ascanio fear life left rome fled grottaferrata 
summoned rome refused come save safe conduct 
fears however appear groundless pope attached importance accusation convinced innocence informed 
thereupon public opinion looked likely person upon fasten indictment lighted upon giuffredo borgia gandia youngest brother 
motive wanting 
already mention made wanton ways giuffredo neapolitan wife sancia 
prodigal favors lack evidence appears amongst admitted dead duke 
jealousy alleged spur driven giuffredo deed rumor must insistent clear find pope publicly exonerating youngest son 
thus matters stood thus public opinion spoken month august pope ordered search murderer cease

tells us definitely alexander positive knowledge least moral conviction cesare killed duke gandia 
see god like knowledge usurps see clairvoyant rather historical 
starting positive assertion cesare borgia murderer sets prove piling mass worthless evidence whose worthlessness unthinkable realized 
according general opinion day probability correct cesare murderer brother 
thus gregorovius lucrezia borgia 
deliberate misstatement pains show crime fastened upon everybody public opinion could conceive possible assassin nearly year gandia death rumor first time connect cesare deed 
ambassadors letters rome dealing murder reporting speculation upon possible murderers never make single allusion cesare guilty person 
later bruited found way writings every defamer borgias several taken gregorovius help uphold theory 
two motives urged crime 
one cesare envy brother desired supplant secular prince fretting cassock imposed upon restrained unbounded ambition 
epoch one consideration reaction age chivalry could dared level without careful examination sources cesare jealousy springing incestuous love sister lucrezia alleged disputed brother 
thus l espinois pointed convict cesare borgia crime absolutely proved necessary charged another crime still horrible even less proof exists 
latter motive true rejected gregorovius

whilst urges incest motive crime murderer tells us giovanni sforza outraged husband gives us fullest details murder time place exactly committed matters never brought light 
worthless garbled piece fiction obviously ever treated plausible untrue least authoritative available evidence assigning guilt cesare 
sanuto accept less careful painstaking chronicler whose writings valuable sanuto matter murder confines quoting letter february accusation cesare first mentioned given earlier letters accuse first ascanio orsini far positively latter letter accuse cesare

handsome boy seventeen time marriage one year younger lucrezia honor event compliance pope insistence created uncle duke biselli prince salerno 
every hand marriage said love match born november boy roderigo 
july third hour night alfonso assaulted grievously wounded mortally said first steps st peter burchard account affair young prince assailed several assassins wounded head right arm knee 
leaving doubt dead fled steps foot forty horsemen awaited escorted city pertusa gate 
prince residing palace cardinal santa maria portico desperate condition found upon steps basilica bore vatican taken chamber borgia tower whilst cardinal capua gave absolution articulo mortis 
deed made great stir rome course subject immediate gossip three days later cesare issued edict forbidding pain death man going armed sant angelo vatican 
news event carried immediately naples king federigo sent physician galieno treat tend nephew 
care doctor hunchback assistant alfonso lay ill wounds august suddenly died great astonishment rome time believed danger 
recording actual death burchard explicit reticent extraordinary degree 
dying writes wound taken yesterday strangled bed nineteenth hour 
chronicling wounded steps st peter death thirty three days later entry burchard diary relating prince anything way help inquirer conclusion whilst subject strangling another word master ceremonies add quoted 
coldly almost cynically state alfonso strangled without much suggesting singular one however grimly laconic seldom reticent notwithstanding may accounted despaired finding diary confirmation points view happen chosen matters pleased believe propagate 
evening alfonso body borne without pomp st peter placed chapel santa maria delle febbre 
accompanied francesco borgia archbishop cosenza 
doctor attendance upon deceased hunchback seized taken sant angelo examined shortly thereafter set liberty 
far upon may consider safe ground 
beyond go save treading uncertain ways speculation following accounts various rumors circulated time 
formal absolutely positive evidence author alfonso murder none 
venetian ambassador ineffable gossip mongering paolo capello seen possessed fullest details concerning duke gandia death although come rome two half years crime circumstantial instance 
see capello forerunner modern journalist baser sort creature prowls quest scraps gossip items scandal found concern greatly matter absolute truth provide sensational copy 
capello bear mind gives us story cesare murdering pope arms pedro caldes elsewhere shown fallen tiber drowned lurid details blood spurting pope face 
famous relazione senate september little better epitome scandal current rome sojourn ambassador resurrection old affair murder gandia goes way towards showing spirit actuated love sensational matter 
pleased writers dealt matter murder alfonso aragon follow capello statements consequently must examined 
writes rome recorded sanuto july alfonso biselli assaulted steps st peter received four wounds one head one arm one shoulder one back 
known capello time wrote letter observe already discrepancy statement penned upon hearsay burchard account considering latter position vatican must always preferred 
according burchard wounds three head right arm knee 
th capello writes stated lucrezia really prostrate grief husband death stricken fever adds known wounded duke biselli said killed threw tiber duke gandia 
lord valentinois issued edict one shall henceforth bear arms sant angelo vatican 
face edict valentinois seems argue vexation happened desire provide repetition provision hardly likely made man organized assault unless sought edict throw dust eyes world one associate event fear criticism nature cesare character given satisfied murdered biselli 
rumor alfonso assailed murderer gandia reasonable enough rumor long latter remains unnamed would simply point enemy house borgia slain one members attempts slay another 
whether capello actually meant cesare penned words july obvious may assumed borne mind date capello yet compiled relation deals gandia murder 
july wrote duke ill indeed wound head th danger owing wound although fever abated 
august announces alfonso death following terms duke biselli madonna lucrezia husband died day planning death duke valentinois means arbalest bolt walked garden duke cut pieces room archers 
cutting pieces form death one dear imagination capello bears witness sensation mongering proclivities 
coming matters public upon evidence acceptable writes th servants prince arrested upon put question confessed prince intent kill duke valentinois adding servant duke implicated 
rd capello circumstantially confirms matter alfonso attempt upon cesare life states confessed master alfonso household brother mother madonna drusa 
sum capello reports senate recorded sanuto 
rest full lurid richly colored sensational story contained relation september 
prefaces narrative informing senate pope bad terms naples proceeds relate case alfonso aragon follows wounded third hour night near palace duke valentinois brother law prince ran pope saying wounded knew wife lucrezia pope daughter room fell anguish 
ill thirty three days wife sister wife prince squillace another son pope cooked saucepan fear poisoned duke valentinois hated 
pope guarded sixteen men fear duke kill 
pope went visit valentinois accompany save one occasion said done breakfast might done supper august valentinois entered room prince already risen bed driving wife sister called man named michieli prince strangled night buried 
following points must arise shake student confidence narrative capello authority upon matters relates wounded near palace duke valentinois 
looks exceedingly like attempt pile evidence cesare shows disposition resort invention 
whatever may known alfonso death known everybody wounded steps st peter capello dispatches said time 
suspicion capello whole relation serve purpose heaping odium upon cesare arises receives confirmation consider already said relation fiction pedro caldes finds place guilt murder duke gandia definitely fixed upon cesare 
ii ran pope corse dal papa saying wounded knew 
man wound head endangered life week would hardly conscious receiving supposed conscious assailants would departed 
doubted left dead 
carried palace know burchard cardinal capua gave absolution articulo mortis abundantly shows condition 
unthinkable able run pope doubtful able speak reported words venetian ambassador capello wisely refrains saying 
iii lucrezia sancia attempt protect poison cooking food room 
quite incredible 
even admitting readiness part princesses need considering presence doctor admitted capello sent naples hunchback assistant iv pope guarded sixteen men fear duke kill 
yet according capello duke comes murderous errand attended michieli generally assumed writers michele da corella one cesare captains sixteen guards capello mentions dismissal lucrezia sancia 
v valentinois said done breakfast might done supper 
observed capello never considers necessary give authorities anything states 
becomes perhaps particularly noteworthy usual case reported speech cesare omits say cesare addressed sinister words reported 
statement hardly one accepted without necessary mention authorities conceive capello omitting possessed 
seen scarcely necessary go outside capello relation purpose traversing statements contained far death alfonso aragon concerned 
however still considered alfonso knew attempted life capello states told pope knew hourly danger death valentinois may surely taken granted would imparted information neapolitan doctor sent uncle must confidence 
know prince death physician hunchback assistant arrested subsequently released 
returned naples naples elsewhere truth must known definite authentic facts lips eye witnesses mere matters rumor case rome 
neapolitan writings must turn truth affair yet naples find rumor echo roman rumor say writes venetian ambassador court king federigo killed pope son 
mischievous document capello relazione seldom found way pages history prime source several unsubstantiated accusations cesare borgia upon subsequent writers drawn accepting without criticism formed conclusions duke character 
even times find learned gregorovius following capello relation step step dealing matter murder duke biselli paraphrases much substantiated unquestionable fact 
find lucrezia borgia following statement affair longer mystery 
cesare publicly declared killed duke life attempted latter 
say cesare publicly declared killed duke say daring thing dangerously improve upon capello 
true cesare made public declaration happen one capello heard documents offered us rumor alfonso died 
surely supposed cesare made declaration letters ambassadors would rung 
yet offer nothing statements rumored gregorovius confine sedulous following capello relation 
serves capello lying story murder pedro caldes 
says cesare support view cesare murdered alfonso aragon could beyond terrible man poignarded spaniard pedro caldes pope cloak blood spurted pope face history rome 
lucrezia borgia almost improves upon says venetian ambassador paolo capello reports cesare borgia stabbed chamberlain perotto etc burchard makes mention fact 
fact stabbing burchard certainly makes mention mention man accidentally drowned considered 
flagrantly ever case proving cesare guilty crime conclusive evidence charging another instance actually evidence commit 
way 
burchard entries diary relating assault upon alfonso aragon escape criticism thoughtful capello relation 
forty horsemen instance need explaining 
apart fact employment forty horsemen would altogether amazing incredible way set murder single man considered troop drawn square st peter must necessity attracted attention 
first hour night remember according burchard say dusk 
presumably horsemen waiting prince arrived 
allowed pass assailed ascending steps burchard presumably see horsemen certainly seen escorting murderers pertusa gate 
therefore must matter reported 
naturally enough horsemen existed must seen 
happen capello hear florentine ambassador says murderers four one else apparently turn moment florentine ambassador letters upon subject find capello francesco capello name accounts differ alike paolo capello burchard stories 
careful say simply repeating rumors abroad cites several different versions current adding truth affair known anybody 
conclusions however particularly given cipher point cesare borgia perpetrator deed hint motive retaliation attempt upon life given ambassador venice 
much mystery matter despite gregorovius assertion contrary mystery mere assertion dissipate 
conclusion however fair draw capello evidence accept cesare borgia responsible death alfonso aragon evidence must accept motive well deed 
must accept equally exact thrice repeated statement letters senate prince planned cesare death posting crossbow men shoot 
extremely significant capello relazione contains mention alfonso plot cesare life matter seen figured repeatedly ambassador dispatches rome time event 
omission yet another proof malicious spirit relation inspired 
suppression anything might justify deed attributed cesare reveals much defamation detraction aims venetian 
either must accept must reject capello tells us 
reject left utterly without information alfonso aragon died 
accept find measure retaliation cesare compassed death brother law made murder private execution justifiable circumstances provocation received adjustment affairs understood cinquecento

much however achieved without money still would needed campaign ahead 
church provided

additional funds accrued almost universally spoken sale twelve cardinals hats 
year september twelve new cardinals appointed upon levied tax tithe first year revenues benefices upon entered 
justifiable exception taken lies number cardinals elected one time lends color assumption sole aim election raise additional funds cesare campaign 
probably also alexander aim strengthen power sacred college could depend upon majority ensure matters 
moment concerned matter levied tax 
dubbed atrocious act simony reasoning construes none clear 
cardinals hats carried vast benefices 
benefices property church gift bestowal pope bestowing pope levied proportionate tax 
setting aside argument tax invention alexander proceeding really amount sale benefices sale presupposes bargaining making terms two parties adjusting price paid 
evidence marketing benefices indeed one cardinal vowed poverty received hat without imposition tax another cesare brother law amanieu albret promised hat year ago 
borne mind four months earlier pope levied similar decima tax upon entire college cardinals every official service holy see purposes expedition muslim arms christianity 
naturally tax popular luxurious self seeking cinquecento prelates main cared entirely prosperity christianity may realize levying alexander laid open harsh criticism 
impugnable matter deed lies said number cardinals created batch 
ends served may held justify altogether least measure means adopted

restoration church however much might means founding borgia dynasty romagna made greater power glory holy see 
let us remember end tax levied upon newly elected cardinals went serve 
aggrandizement house borgia certainly one results expected romagna campaign justified accounting sole aim end campaign 
alexander advantage either sixtus iv innocent viii go beyond popes served vice chancellor instances flagrant nepotism least served two purposes aggrandizing family strengthened temporal power church whereas others done nothing undermine might enrich progeny 
whilst subject sale cardinals hats may amiss say word concerning sale indulgences alexander freely charged 
loud outcry alexander outcry whose indignant stridency leads one suppose sale indulgences simony invented else practiced extent shamefully unprecedented 
far case 
arch type indulgence seller simoniacal practices innocent viii 
reign seen murderer commonly given choose hangman purchase pardon seen moneys obtained providing bastard cardinal francesco cibo means luxuriously licentious life whose gross disorders prematurely killed 
flagitious lengths shown alexander carried sale indulgences dispensed 
lack precedent practice far actual practice concerned would difficult show unjustifiable simoniacal long confined within certain well defined bounds long sums levied properly employed benefit christianity 
practice comparable mulcting civil offender magisterial laws 
magistrates levy fines occur modern critics say sell pardons immunity gaol 
universally recognized wise commendable measure serving two fold purpose punishing offender benefiting temporal state offended 
need less commendable case spiritual offences spiritual state useful imposition pattering dozen prayers bedtime since doubt falls heavily upon offender possibly makes even greater extent spiritual improvement 
thus considered sale indulgences loses deal heinousness invested 
funds realized go coffers church fit proper
