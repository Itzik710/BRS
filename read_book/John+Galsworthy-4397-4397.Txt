writing bosinney terms already chronicled soames dismissed cost house mind 
believed made matter final cost plain possibility exceeded really never entered head 
hearing bosinney limit twelve thousand pounds would exceeded something like four hundred grown white anger 
original estimate cost house completed ten thousand pounds often blamed severely allowing led repeated excesses 
last expenditure however bosinney put completely wrong 
earth fellow could make ass soames could conceive done rancor hidden jealousy burning long focussed rage crowning piece extravagance 
attitude confident friendly husband gone 
preserve property wife assumed preserve property another kind lost 
ah said bosinney could speak suppose perfectly contented 
may well tell altogether mistaken man meant words quite know time dinner looked correspondence bosinney make quite sure
