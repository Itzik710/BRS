anderson retired gracefully jingling scanty handful nickels dimes half hour later thrust boldly upon another editor better result 
made rounds offices although invariably rebuffed became firmly convinced ever journalism designated sphere 
night dinner retired room evening papers wedged chair bed hoisting feet upon wash stand absorbed news day 
ineffably sweet satisfying thus identified profession letters immeasurably dignified tugging saginaw river 
schooled tricks writing decided would step higher things newspaper work present well ground firmly rudiments craft 
going papers noted one topic interested similar mystery story second page

anderson read body golden haired girl still lay morgue unidentified 
bit bit pieced together lean story suicide police press failed efforts unearth least particle information regarding

following day anderson walked editorial rooms intelligencer greeted smooth fat faced occupant thereof 
anything yet inquired

cinch hidden away among back pages encountered golden haired girl story although one paper featured bit imaginary clue others treated casually making public information body still lay morgue silent irritating thing mystery 
third day paul made usual round calls 
made quickly recognized practically thrown editorial sanctum 
serenity remained unruffled confidence undisturbed 
six editors burns intelligencer treated worst adding ridicule gruffness refinement cruelty annoyed young steamboat man

anderson questioned girl length discovered nothing moment left declaring would probably move room following day 
prom rooming house went directly morgue second time examined body confining attention particularly hands 
right one showed nothing upon found theory save indeed capable hand smooth skin well tended nails examining left paul noted marked peculiarity 
near ends thumb first finger skin roughened abrased numerous tiny black spots beneath skin upon careful scrutiny discovered microscopic blood blisters 
long time puzzled phenomenon escaped previous observers save could invent explanation 
repaired finally office attendant asked girl clothes receiving permission examine small bundle 
rest demanded

reading figures paul heard reporter say loudly written paper take another answered 
inquired first voice 
hawkshaw detective 
anderson cheeks flushed returned bag contents without comment walked heedless laughter six reporters 
injustice ridicule burnt like branding iron offense lay trying impossible 
fellows done best failed yet jeered tackled forlorn hope 
taken trail hot lost railed took cold 
afternoon tramped streets thinking thinking brain went stale 
fresh clues discovered thus far marks finger thumb fact girl canadian possessed one mitten instead two 
last obvious reasons trivial mean anything yet obscure case could ignored 
fact canadian helped little therefore best point upon hang line reasoning seemed black spots left hand 
stumped anderson absolutely 
altered mental approach subject reflected upon girl belongings 
taken entirety showed nothing save girl poor therefore began mentally assort one one 
first clothes 
ordinary clothes betrayed nothing
