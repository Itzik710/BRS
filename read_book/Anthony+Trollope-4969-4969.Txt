expressed intention leave fifteen hundred pounds niece miss amedroz death come upon quickly enable perform purpose 
intention part mrs winterfield mr palmer well aware mentioned subject merely object saying matter course legacy miss amedroz good though codicil completed 
question could arise question legal right understood legal claim miss amedroz circumstances void 
therefore affair generosity part 
little buzz satisfaction part present meeting broken 
certain old mrs folliott cousin everybody concerned come taunton see things going 
always variance mrs winterfield woman loved cards supper parties throughout life stabled horses stalls different used lady perivale 
mrs folliott first tell clara
