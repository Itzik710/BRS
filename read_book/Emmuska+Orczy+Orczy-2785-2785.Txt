ever wild surging torrent sowing wind anarchy terrorism lust blood hate reaping hurricane destruction horror 
ever france paris children still rushes blindly madly defies powerful coalition austria england spain prussia joined together stem flow carnage defies universe defies god paris september shall call vendemiaire year republic call paris city bloodshed humanity lowest degraded aspect 
france gigantic self devouring monster fairest cities destroyed lyons razed ground toulon marseilles masses blackened ruins bravest sons turned lustful brutes abject cowards seeking safety cost humiliation 
thy reward oh mighty holy revolution apotheosis equality fraternity grand rival decadent christianity 
five weeks since marat bloodthirsty friend people succumbed beneath sheath knife virgin patriot month since murderess walked proudly even enthusiastically guillotine reaction great sigh content satisfied lust sigh man eating tiger might heave first taste long coveted blood 
sigh king scaffold queen degraded abased awaiting death lingers threshold infamous prison eight hundred scions ancient houses made history france brave generals custine blanchelande houchard beauharnais worthy patriots noble hearted women misguided enthusiasts score hundred wooden steps lead guillotine

let us means new religion 
already something done destroy old destroy always destroy churches ransacked altars spoliated tombs desecrated priests curates murdered enough 
must new religion attain must new god 
man born idol worshipper 
well let people new religion new god 
stay god time god means majesty power kingship everything fact mighty hand people france struggled fought destroy 
god goddess 
goddess idol toy since even man eating tiger must play sometimes 
paris wanted new religion new toy grave men ardent patriots mad enthusiasts sat assembly convention seriously discussed means providing things asked 
chaumette think first solved difficulty procureur chaumette head paris municipality ordered cart bore dethroned queen squalid prison conciergerie led slowly past late palace tuileries stopped long enough see feel one grand mental vision dwelt people 
chaumette see refined artistic torture fallen queen heart meant blow guillotine neck 
wonder therefore procureur chaumette first discovered exactly type new religion paris wanted 
let us goddess reason said typified beautiful woman paris 
let us feast goddess reason let pyre gew gaws centuries flaunted overbearing priests eyes starving multitudes let people rejoice dance around funeral pile let new goddess tower smiling triumphant 
goddess reason deity new regenerate france shall acknowledge throughout centuries come loud applause greeted impassioned speech 
new goddess means shouted grave gentlemen national assembly goddess reason eager people toy something play tease round dance mad carmagnole sing ever recurring ca ira 
something distract minds populace consequences deeds helplessness legislators 
procureur chaumette enlarged upon original idea like true artist sees broad effect picture glance fills minute details already busy elaborating scheme 
goddess must beautiful young reason go hand hand riper age second youth must decked classical draperies severe yet suggestive must rouged painted mere idol easily appeased incense music laughter 
getting deeply interested subject seeking minutiae detail render theme attractive 
patience never characteristic revolutionary government france 
national assembly soon tired chaumette dithyrambic utterances 
aloft mountain danton yawning like gigantic leopard 
soon henriot feet 
far finer scheme procureur place colleagues 
grand national fete semi religious character new religion destroyed desecrated never knelt worship 
citizen chaumette goddess reason means henriot conceded idea good one goddess merely figure head around procession unfrocked apostate priests typifying destruction ancient hierarchy mules carrying loads sacred vessels spoils ten thousand churches france ballet girls bacchanalian robes dancing carmagnole around new deity 
public prosecutor foucquier tinville thought schemes tame 
people france led think era new religion would mean era milk water pageants fireworks let every man woman child know era blood blood 
oh exclaimed passionate accents would traitors france one head might cut one blow guillotine approved national fete desired apotheosis guillotine undertook find ten thousand traitors beheaded one grand glorious day ten thousand heads adorn place de la revolution great never forgotten evening guillotine accomplished record work 
collot herbois would also say 
collot lately hailed south reputation ferocity unparalleled throughout whole horrible decade 
would outdone tinville bloodthirsty schemes 
inventor noyades successful lyons marseilles 
give inhabitants paris one exhilarating spectacles asked coarse brutal laugh 
explained invention inordinately proud 
two three hundred traitors men women children tied securely together ropes great human bundles thrown upon barge middle river barge hole bottom large sufficient cause sink slowly slowly sight crowd delighted spectators 
cries women children even men felt waters rising gradually enveloping felt powerless even fruitless struggle proved exhilarating citizen collot declared hearts true patriots lyons 
thus discussion continued 
era every man one desire outdoing others ferocity brutality one care saving head threatening neighbor 
great duel titanic leaders turbulent parties conflict hot headed danton one side cold blooded robespierre begun great devouring monsters dug claws one another issue combat still stake 
neither two giants taken part deliberations anent new religion new goddess 
danton gave signs greatest impatience muttered something new form tyranny new kind oppression 
left robespierre immaculate sea green coat carefully gauffered linen quietly polishing nails right hand palm left 
nothing escaped going 
ferocious egoism unbounded ambition even calculating advantages might accrue idea new religion national fete personal aggrandisement could derive therefrom 
matter outwardly seemed trivial enough already keen calculating mind seen various side issues might tend place robespierre yet higher unassailable pinnacle 
surrounded hated envied feared ruled strength cold blooded savagery resistless power merciless cruelty 
cared nobody nothing exaltation every action career since gave small practice quiet provincial town order throw wild vortex revolutionary politics every word ever uttered one aim 
saw colleagues comrades old jacobin clubs ruthlessly destroyed around friends none left indifferent hundreds enemies every assembly club paris one one swept wild whirlpool created 
impassive serene always ready calm answer passion raged hotly around robespierre ambitious self seeking demagogue time acquired reputation incorruptible self less enthusiastic servant republic 
sea green incorruptible thus whilst others talked argued waxed hot schemes processions pageantry loudly denounced whole matter work traitor sea green coat sat quietly polishing nails 
already weighed discussions balance mind placed crucible ambition turned something would benefit strengthen position 
aye feast brilliant enough gay horrible mad fearful people france must made feel guiding hand ruled destinies head framed new laws consolidated new religion established new goddess goddess reason 
robespierre prophet chapter ii retrospect room close dark filled smoke defective chimney 
tiny boudoir dainty sanctum imperious marie antoinette faint ghostly odour like unto perfume spectres seemed still cling stained walls torn gobelin tapestries 
everywhere lay impress heavy destroying hand great glorious revolution 
mud soiled corners room chairs brocaded cushions rudely torn leaned broken desolate walls 
small footstool gilt legged satin covered overturned roughly kicked one side lay back like little animal hurt stretching broken limbs upwards pathetic behold 
delicately wrought buhl table silver inlay harshly stripped bed shell 
across lunette painted boucher representing chaste diana surrounded bevy nymphs uncouth hand scribbled charcoal device revolution liberte egalite fraternite ou la mort whilst give crowning point work destruction emphasise motto someone decorated portrait marie antoinette scarlet cap drawn red ominous line across neck 
table two men sitting close eager conclave 
solitary tallow candle unsnuffed weirdly flickering threw fantastic shadows upon walls illumined fitful uncertain light faces two men 
different character one high cheek boned coarse sensuous lips hair elaborately carefully powdered pale thin lipped keen eyes ferret high intellectual forehead sleek brown hair smoothly brushed away 
first men robespierre ruthless incorruptible demagogue citizen chauvelin ex ambassador revolutionary government english court 
hour late noises great seething city preparing sleep came remote little apartment deserted palace tuileries merely faint distant echo 
two days fructidor riots 
paul deroulede woman juliette marny condemned death literally spirited away cart conveying hall justice luxembourg prison news received committee public safety lyons abbe du mesnil ci devant chevalier egremont latter wife family effected miraculous wholly incomprehensible escape northern prison 

arras fell hands revolutionary army regular cordon formed round town single royalist traitor might escape three score women children twelve priests old aristocrats chermeuil delleville galipaux many others managed pass barriers never recaptured 
raids made suspected houses paris chiefly escaped prisoners might found refuge better still helpers rescuers might still lurking 
foucquier tinville public prosecutor led conducted raids assisted bloodthirsty vampire merlin

citizeness name brogard husband brother kept inn neighborhood calais citizeness brogard clear conscience 
held license committee public safety letting apartments always given due notice committee arrival departure lodgers 
thing lodger paid ordinarily well accommodation desired would send notice conveniently late conveniently vaguely worded description status nationality liberal patrons 
occurred case recent english visitor 
explain quite like citizen foucquier tinville citizen merlin 
however rather frightened produced scrap paper englishman left together assurance showed would trouble 
tinville took roughly hand would glance 
crushed ball merlin snatched coarse laugh smoothed creases knee studied moment 
two lines looked like poetry written language merlin understand 
english doubt 
perfectly clear easily comprehended one little drawing corner done red ink representing small star shaped flower 
tinville merlin cursed loudly volubly bidding men follow turned away house rue de l ancienne comedie left toothless landlady doorstep still volubly protesting patriotism desire serve government republic 
tinville merlin however took scrap paper citizen robespierre smiled grimly turn crushed offensive little document palm well washed hands 
robespierre swear 
never wasted either words oaths slipped bit paper inside double lid silver snuff box sent special messenger citizen chauvelin rue corneille bidding come evening ten clock room ci devant palace tuileries 
half past ten chauvelin robespierre sat opposite one another ex boudoir queen marie antoinette table tallow candle much creased exceedingly grimy bit paper 
passed several unclean hands citizen robespierre immaculately white fingers smoothed placed eyes ex ambassador chauvelin 
latter however looking paper even looking pale cruel face 
closed eyes moment lost sight small dark room robespierre ruthless gaze mud stained walls greasy floor 
seeing bright sudden vision brilliantly lighted salons foreign office london beautiful marguerite blakeney gliding queenlike arm prince wales 
heard flutter many fans frou frou silk dresses din sound dance music heard inane laugh affected voice repeating doggerel rhyme even written dirty piece paper robespierre placed seek seek frenchies seek everywhere heaven hell demmed elusive pimpernel mere flash one memory swiftly effaced pictures shows us fraction second indelible pictures past 
chauvelin second eyes closed robespierre fixed upon also saw lonely cliffs calais heard voice singing god save king volley musketry despairing cries marguerite blakeney felt keen bitter pang complete humiliation defeat 
chapter iii ex ambassador chauvelin robespierre quietly waited 
hurry night bird pronounced tastes quite ready sit small hours morning watching citizen chauvelin mentally writhing throes recollections past months 
nothing delighted sea green incorruptible quite much aspect man struggling hopeless situation feeling net intrigue drawing gradually tighter tighter around 
even saw chauvelin smooth forehead wrinkled anxious frown thin hand nervously clutched upon table robespierre heaved pleasurable sigh leaned back chair said amiable smile agree citizen situation become intolerable chauvelin reply continued speaking sharply terribly galling could man guillotine blundered terribly last year 
voice become hard trenchant like knife ready make constant allusion 
chauvelin still remained silent 
really nothing could say 
citizen chauvelin must hate man exclaimed robespierre last 
chauvelin break silence appeared forced keep 
said unmistakable fervor 
make effort retrieve blunders last year queried robespierre blandly 
republic unusually patient long suffering citizen chauvelin 
taken many services well known patriotism consideration 
know added significantly use worthless tools 
chauvelin seemed relapsed sullen silence continued original ill omened blandness foi citizen chauvelin standing buckled shoes would lose another hour trying avenge mine humiliation ever chance burst chauvelin ill suppressed vehemence 
single handed since war declared go england unless government find official reason 
much grumbling wrath damned scarlet pimpernel league work score valuable prizes snatched knife guillotine much gnashing teeth useless cursings nothing serious definite done smother accursed english flies come buzzing ears 
nay forget citizen chauvelin retorted robespierre committee public safety far helpless 
know language people know manners customs ways thought methods likely employ know none things 
seen spoken men england members damned league 
seen man leader 

leaned forward table looked searchingly thin pallid face 
named leader described could go work easily 
could name would citizen chauvelin 
retorted chauvelin doggedly 
ah think could 
blame silence 
would wish reap reward victory instrument revenge 
passions think natural name safety citizen greedy secret 
man known find find lure france want people want people get want turn withheld prey 
understand citizen safety government involved renewed attempt capture scarlet pimpernel retorted chauvelin drily 
head citizen chauvelin concluded robespierre 
nay know well enough may believe citizen say care little 
question lure man france government help everything replied robespierre provided definite plan definite purpose 

must go england least semi official capacity 
nothing hide disguise way corners 
easily done 
talk british authorities anent security welfare peaceful french subjects settled england 
good deal correspondence suggested sending semi official representative look interests people commercially financially 
easily send capacity would suit purpose 
admirably 
need cloak 
one well another 
quite 
several plans head must know fully trusted 
must power decisive absolute illimitable power 
nothing weakling small sable clad man looked redoubtable jacobin leader straight face brought firm fist resolutely upon table 
robespierre paused ere replied eying man keenly trying read behind earnest frowning brow lurk selfish ulterior motive along demand absolute power 
chauvelin flinch beneath gaze could make every cheek france blanch unnamed terror slight moment hesitation robespierre said quietly shall complete power military dictator every town borough france may visit 
revolutionary government shall create start england supreme head sub committees public safety 
mean name safety republic every order given whatsoever nature might must obeyed implicitly pain arraignment treason 
chauvelin sighed quick sharp sigh intense satisfaction even attempt disguise robespierre 
shall want agents said shall say spies course money 
shall 
keep efficient secret service england great deal good 
much dissatisfaction midland counties remember birmingham riots chiefly work spies 
know candeille actress found way among circles london call liberal tendencies 
believe called whigs 
funny name means perruque think 
candeille given charity performances aid paris poor one two whig clubs incidentally useful us 
woman always useful cases 
shall seek citizeness candeille 
renders useful assistance think offer prove tempting prize 
women vain added contemplating rapt attention enamel like polish finger nails 
vacancy maison moliere 
might prove attractive still connection proposed national fete new religion people yet chosen goddess reason 
appeal feminine mind 
impersonation goddess processions pageants rest great importance prominence given one personality say citizen really need woman furtherance plans disposal may enhance zeal 
thank citizen rejoined chauvelin calmly 
always entertained hope day revolutionary government would call services 
admit failed last year 
englishman resourceful 
wits rich 
would succeeded think money corruption bribery rife paris coasts 
slipped fingers moment thought held securely 
admit prepared redeem failure last year nothing discuss 
ready start 
looked round cloak hat quietly readjusted set neck tie 
robespierre detained longer born mountebank born torturer souls men gloated sufficiently yet agony mind fellow man 
chauvelin always trusted respected 
services connection foreign affairs revolutionary government invaluable since beginning european war 
one time formed part merciless decemvirate robespierre head meant govern france laws bloodshed unparalleled ferocity 
sea green incorruptible since tired endeavored push one side chauvelin keen clever moreover possessed qualities selfless patriotism conspicuously lacking robespierre 
failure bringing interfering scarlet pimpernel justice guillotine completed chauvelin downfall 
though otherwise molested left moulder obscurity past year 
would soon enough completely forgotten 
given one chance regain public favor demanded powers consideration aim view robespierre could refuse grant 
incorruptible ever envious jealous would allow exult soon 
characteristic blandness seemed entering chauvelin schemes helping every way could something back mind meant say ex ambassador latter took leave something would show trial would demonstrate perfect clearness hovered powerful hand master 
name sum want citizen chauvelin said incorruptible encouraging smile government stint shall fail lack authority lack funds 
pleasant hear government uncounted wealth remarked chauvelin dry sarcasm 
oh last weeks profitable retorted robespierre confiscated money jewels emigrant royalists tune several million francs 
remember traitor juliette marny escape england lately well mother jewels quite good deal gold discovered one able spies care certain abbe foucquet calotin boulogne devoted family seems 
yes queried chauvelin indifferently 
men seized jewels gold 
know yet mean priest 
fisherfolk boulogne like lay hands time want old head guillotine 
jewels worth 
historic necklace worth half million least 
could asked chauvelin 
robespierre laughed shrugged shoulders 
said belonged marny family continued ex ambassador 
juliette marny england 
might meet 
tell may happen feel historic necklace might prove useful 
please added renewed indifference 
thought flashed mind spoke nothing 
show thoroughly government trusts citizen chauvelin replied robespierre perfect urbanity direct marny necklace placed unreservedly hands sum fifty thousand francs expenses england 
see added blandly give excuse second failure 
need none retorted chauvelin drily finally rose seat sigh satisfaction interview ended last 
robespierre risen pushing chair aside took step two towards chauvelin 
much taller man ex ambassador 
spare gaunt upright bearing uncertain light candle seemed tower strangely weirdly man pale hue coat light colored hair whiteness linen helped give appearance moment curious spectral effect 
chauvelin somehow felt unpleasant shiver running spine robespierre perfectly urbane gentle manner placed long bony hand upon shoulder 
citizen chauvelin said incorruptible degree dignified solemnity meseems quickly understood one another evening 
conscience doubt gave premonition purport summons would 
say always hoped revolutionary government would give one great chance redeem failure last year 
one always intended chance saw perhaps little deeper heart colleagues 
saw enthusiasm cause people france abhorrence enemy country saw purely personal deadly hate individual man unknown mysterious englishman proved clever last year 
believe hatred prove sharper far seeing selfless patriotism therefore urged committee public safety allow work revenge thereby serve country effectually perhaps pure minded patriot would 
go england well provided necessary success plans accomplishment personal vengeance 
revolutionary government help money passports safe conducts places spies agents disposal 
gives practically unlimited power wherever may go 
enquire motives yet means long lead success 
private vengeance patriotism whatever may actuate france demand deliver hands man known two countries scarlet pimpernel want alive possible dead must want many henchmen follow guillotine 
get france know deal let whole europe damned 
paused hand still resting chauvelin shoulder pale green eyes holding man trance 
chauvelin neither stirred spoke 
triumph left quite calm fertile brain already busy plans 
room fear heart without slightest tremor waited conclusion robespierre oration 
perhaps citizen chauvelin said latter last already guessed left say 
lest remain mind one faint glimmer doubt hope let tell 
revolutionary government gives chance redeeming failure one fail outraged country know neither pardon mercy 
whether return france remain england whether travel north south east west cross oceans traverse alps hand avenging people upon 
second failure punished death wherever may either guillotine france seek refuge elsewhere hand assassin 
look citizen chauvelin escape time even mightiest tyrant earth tried protect even succeeded building empire placing upon throne 
thin strident voice echoed weirdly small close boudoir 
chauvelin made reply 
nothing could say 
robespierre put emphatically fully realized even whilst forming daring plans 
either time uttered 
thought marguerite blakeney terrible alternative put less year ago 
well prepared take risk 
would fail 
going england favourable conditions time 
knew man bidden lure france death 
returned robespierre threatening gaze boldly unflinchingly prepared go 
took hat cloak opened door peered moment dark corridor wherein far distance steps solitary sentinel could faintly heard put hat turned look room robespierre stood quietly watching went way

chapter xvii boulogne journey marguerite much leisure think 
discomforts petty miseries incidental cheap traveling welcome effect making forget time soul rendering crisis passing 
necessity travel cheap rate among crowd poorer passengers herded aft packet boat leaning one another sitting bundles packages kinds part deck reeking smell tar sea water damp squally stuffy abomination hideous discomfort dainty fastidious lady fashion yet almost welcomed intolerable propinquity cold douches salt water every wetted consequent sense physical wretchedness helped forget intolerable anguish mind 
among poorer travellers felt secure observation 
one took much notice 
looked like one herd huddled little figure dark bedraggled clothes one would moment recognized dazzling personality lady blakeney 
drawing hood well head sat secluded corner deck upon little black valise contained belongings brought 
cloak dress mud stained dank splashings salt water attracted one attention 
keen northeasterly breeze cold penetrating favourable rapid crossing 
marguerite gone several hours weary traveling coach embarked dover late afternoon unspeakably tired 
watched golden sunset sea eyes burning pain dazzling crimson orange purple gave place soft gray tones evening descried round cupola church lady boulogne dull background sky 
mind became blank 
sort torpor fell sense wakeful yet half asleep unconscious everything around seeing nothing distant massive towers old boulogne churches gradually detaching one one fast gathering gloom 
town seemed like dream city creation morbid imagination presented mind eye city sorrow death 
boat finally scraped sides along rough wooden jetty marguerite felt forcibly awakened 
numb stiff thought must fallen asleep last half hour journey 
everything round dark 
sky overcast night seemed unusually sombre 
figures moving around noise confusion voices general pushing shouting seemed strangely weird gloom 
among poorer passengers thought necessity light one solitary lantern fixed mast enhanced intense blackness everything around 
face would come within range meager streak yellow light looking strangely distorted great elongated shadows across brow chin grotesque ghostly apparition quickly vanished scurrying like frightened gnome giving place forms figures equally grotesque equally weird 
marguerite watched half stupidly motionlessly awhile 
quite know ought like ask questions dazed darkness blinded 
gradually things began detach clearly 
looking straight began discern landing place little wooden bridge across passengers walked one one boat unto jetty 
first class passengers evidently alighting crowd marguerite formed unit pushed back compact herd way moment betters might get along comfortably 
beyond landing stage little booth erected kind tent open front lighted within couple lanthorns 
tent table behind sat man dressed sort official looking clothes wearing tricolor scarf across chest 
passengers boat apparently file past tent 
marguerite could see quite distinctly profiles various faces paused moment front table brilliantly illuminated one lanterns 
two sentinels wearing uniform national guard stood side table 
passengers one one took passport went handed man official dress examined carefully lengthily signed returned paper owner times appeared doubtful folded passport put front passenger would protest marguerite could hear said could see argument attempted quickly dismissed peremptory order official 
doubtful passport obviously put one side examination unfortunate owner thereof detained able give satisfactory references representatives committee public safety stationed boulogne 
process examination necessarily took long time 
marguerite getting horribly tired feet ached scarcely could hold upright yet watched people mechanically making absurd little guesses weary mind whose passport would find favor eyes official whose would found suspect inadequate 
suspect terrible word times since merlin terrible law decreed every man woman child suspected republic traitor traitor fact 
sorry felt whose passports detained tried argue needlessly finally led soldier stepped somewhere dark await examination probably imprisonment often death 
felt quite safe passport given chauvelin accomplice sure quite en regle 
suddenly heart seemed give sudden leap stop beating second two 
one passengers man passing front tent recognized form profile chauvelin 
passport show evidently official knew stood saluted listened deferentially whilst ex ambassador apparently gave instructions

could quite sure 
women closely hooded veiled attention completely absorbed sudden appearance deadly enemy 
yet natural chauvelin object accomplished doubt posted dover done 
difficulty man type importance would always unlimited means money command accomplish journey might desire undertake 
nothing strange even unexpected man presence yet somehow made whole awful reality tangible wholly unforgettable 
marguerite remembered abject words first seen richmond fete said fallen disgrace failed service republic relegated subordinate position pushed aside contumely make room better abler men 
well lie course cunning method gaining access house already convinced candeille provoked esclandre led challenge 
french soil seemed anything subsidiary position appeared rule rather obey could way appear marguerite nature surprise 
actress willing tool cunning hands chauvelin probably people around 
others cringed face officialism ex ambassador stepped forth master shown badge spoken word mayhap man tent made people tremble stood deferentially obeyed commands 
simple obvious marguerite mind asleep sight sable clad little figure roused happy torpor

nay measure mad already 
hours days years heard nothing save rhythmic walk sentinel kindly tremulous voice abbe whispering consolations murmuring prayers ears seen nothing save prison door rough deal painted dull gray great old fashioned lock hinges rusty damp ages 
kept eyes fixed door burned ached well nigh intolerable pain yet felt could look elsewhere lest missed golden moment bolts would drawn dull gray door would swing slowly rusty hinges 
surely surely commencement madness yet percy sake might want might need courage presence mind tried keep wits 
difficult oh terribly difficult especially shade evening began gather peopled squalid whitewashed room innumerable threatening ghouls 
moon came silver ray crept tiny window struck full upon gray door making look weird spectral like entrance house ghosts 
even distinct sound pushing bolts bars marguerite thought prey hallucinations 
abbe foucquet sitting remote darkest corner room quietly telling beads 
serene philosophy gentle placidity could way disturbed opening shutting door bearer good evil tidings 
room seemed strangely gloomy cavernous deep black shadows around white ray moon struck weirdly door 
marguerite shuddered one unaccountable premonitions something evil come ofttimes assail nervous passionate temperament 
door swung slowly open upon hinges quick word command light small oil lamp struck full gloom 
vaguely marguerite discerned group men soldiers doubt glint arms suggestion tricolor cockades scarves 
one men holding lamp aloft another took steps forward room

marguerite caught sight room beyond dark gloomy looking prison cell 
somewhere left obviously window could see guessed moon struck full upon floor ghost like spectral well fitting dream like state marguerite felt 
center room could discern table chair close beside also couple tallow candles flickered draught caused doubt open window could see 
little details impressed marguerite mind stood placidly waiting told move along 
table chair unseen window trivial objects though assumed overwrought fancy utterly disproportionate importance 
caught presently counting number boards visible floor watching smoke tallow candles rising towards grimy ceiling 
minutes weary waiting seemed endless marguerite came short word command within roughly pushed forward room one men 
cool air late september evening gently fanned burning temples 
looked round perceived someone sitting table side tallow candles man head bent bundle papers shading face light hand 
rose approached flickering flame candles played weirdly upon slight sable clad figure illumining keen ferret like face throwing fitful gleams across deep set eyes narrow cruel mouth 
chauvelin

quietly shrugged shoulders 
ah fear said ladyship usual doth grievous wrong

chauvelin knew past master art putting knife victim throat giving necessary twist cruel relentless unless felt quite calm purpose resolute 
doubt agonizing moment suspense absolutely firm determination accept every condition chauvelin would put price husband safety 
conditions since placed could resolve questions life husband unreasoning impulse one salient characteristics never paused think chauvelin life death means great end view complete annihilation scarlet pimpernel 
end could reached percy blakeney death 
even watching eyes glowing lips tightly closed lest cry impatient agony escape throat like snail shown slimy horns soon ready face enemy yet seemed suddenly withdraw within former shell careless suavity 
earnestness tone vanished giving place light easy conversation discussing social topics woman fashion paris drawing room 
nay said pleasantly ladyship taking matter serious spirit truth repeated innocent word unless even putting knife dainty throat 
yet meant naught need disturb yet 
said friend let try prove

chauvelin asked almost stupidly truly even begun grasp meaning

trying fool chauvelin purpose lie like honor tis truth 
death sir percy blakeney may call may would ill suit purpose view

pray add many protestations friendship little clearness speech possible little brevity 
purpose view enticed husband come france purpose destruction scarlet pimpernel death sir percy blakeney 
believe great regard sir percy 
accomplished gentleman witty brilliant inimitable dandy 
grace presence drawing rooms london brighton many years come looked puzzled inquiry 
one moment thought flashed mind chauvelin might still doubt identity scarlet pimpernel hope madness preposterous impossible oh god little patience said may seem little enigmatic ladyship continued blandly surely clever woman great lady wife sir percy blakeney baronet aware means destroying enemy taking life

long bitter laugh almost hysterical loud outburst broke depths marguerite convulsed heart 
destruction honor ha ha ha ha truth monsieur chauvelin inventive powers led beyond bounds dreamland ha ha ha ha land madness wandering sir talk one breath sir percy blakeney possible destruction honor remained apparently quite unruffled laughter somewhat subsided said placidly perhaps rose chair approached 
time shrink 
suggestion made talk attacking husband honor rather life seemed wild preposterous conception truly mind unhinged looked upon sign extreme weakness part almost acknowledgement impotence 
watched moved round table ore curiosity fright 
puzzled still feeling back mind must something definite evil lurking back tortuous brain 
ladyship allow conduct yonder window said air cool say best done sight yonder sleeping city 
tone one perfect courtesy even respectful deference slightest trace sarcasm could discerned still actuated curiosity interest way fear quietly rose obey 
though ignored hand holding towards followed readily enough walked window 
agonizing soul stirring interview felt heavily oppressed close atmosphere room rendered nauseous evil smell smoky tallow candles left spread grease smoke abroad unchecked 
twice gazed longingly towards suggestion pure air outside 
chauvelin evidently still much say torturing mental rack subjected yet fully done work 
still capable one two turns twist might succeed crushing pride defiance 
well man power placed therein unreasoning impulse 
interview one many soul agonies called upon endure submitting could measure mitigate faults help man loved would find sacrifice small mental torture easy bear 
therefore chauvelin beckoned draw near went window leaning head deep stone embrasure looked night 
chapter xxiii hostage chauvelin without speaking extended hand towards city invite marguerite gaze upon 
quite unconscious hour night might must late little town encircled stony arms forts seemed asleep 
moon slowly sinking west edged towers spires filmy lines silver 
right marguerite caught sight frowning beffroi even gazed began tolling heavy bell 
sounded like tocsin dull muffled 
ten strokes still 
ten clock hour far england fashionable london play crowds gaily dressed men women poured open gates theaters calling loudly attendant chaise 
thence balls routs gaily fluttering like many butterflies brilliant irresponsible england also beautiful gardens richmond home ofttimes ten clock wandered alone percy home spirit adventure momentarily laid rest 
night dark air heavy scent roses lilies lay quiescent arms little arbor beside river 
rhythmic lapping waves sound stirred balmy air 
seldom spoke voice would shake whenever uttered word impenetrable armor flippancy pierced speak lips pressed love soared beyond domain speech 
shudder intense mental pain went gazed sleeping city sweet memories past turned bitterness agonizing present 
one one moon gradually disappeared behind bank clouds towers boulogne merged gloom 
front far far away beyond flat sand dunes sea seemed calling ghostly melancholy moan 
window ground floor fort gave direct onto wide shady walk runs along crest city walls stood marguerite looking straight along ramparts thirty metres wide point flanked either side granite balustrade adorned double row ancient elms stunted twisted grotesque shapes persistent action wind 
wide ramparts peculiarity city said voice close ear times peace form agreeable promenade shade trees delightful meeting place lovers enemies sound brought back ugly realities present rose scented garden richmond lazily flowing river tender memories brief moment confronted happy past suddenly vanished ken 
instead brine laden sea air struck quivering nostrils echo old beffroi died away ear one streets open places sleeping city came sound raucous voice shooting monotonous tones string words meaning failed reach brain 
many feet window southern ramparts town stretched away darkness 
felt unaccountably cold suddenly looked upon aching eyes tried pierce gloom 
shivering spite mildness early autumnal night overwrought fancy peopling lonely walls unearthly shapes strolling along discussing spectral language strange duel take place noted butcher men mad englishman overfond adventure 
ghouls seemed pass repass along front laughing audibly mad englishman offered life exchange honor 
laughed laughed doubt refused bargain englishmen always eccentric days equality devices free glorious revolution honor marketable commodity seemed ridiculous prize quite highly 
strolled away disappeared whilst marguerite distinctly heard scrunching path beneath feet 
leaned forward peer still darkness sound seemed absolutely real immediately detaining hand place upon arm sarcastic voice murmured elbow result fair lady would broken leg arm height great enough picturesque suicides believe ramparts haunted ghosts 
drew back viper stung moment become oblivious chauvelin presence 
however would take notices taunt slight pause asked could hear town crier public streets 
yes replied 
says present moment vast importance ladyship remarked drily 
ladyship precious hostage 
taking measures guard valuable property securely 
marguerite thought abbe foucquet doubt still quietly telling beads even heart begun wonder become 
thought francois breadwinner felicite blind 
methinks colleagues done already said 
completely would wish 
know daring scarlet pimpernel 
even ashamed admit fear luck impudence marvellous ingenuity told greatest possible respect mysterious english hero old priest two young children might spirited away enigmatical adventurer even whilst lady blakeney made vanish sight 
ah see ladyship taking simple words confession weakness continued noting swift sigh hope involuntarily escaped lips 
nay please shall despise 
confession weakness first sign strength 
scarlet pimpernel still large whilst guard hostage securely bound fall hands 
aye still large retorted impulsive defiance 
think bolts bars ingenuity colleagues collaboration devil would succeed outwitting scarlet pimpernel purpose try drag clutches 
felt hopeful proud 
pure air heaven lungs afar could smell sea could feel perhaps straight line vision stood day dream sir percy board might lying roads seemed impossible fail freeing poor people old man two children whose lives depended 
chauvelin laughed dry sarcastic laugh said hm perhaps course depend personality feelings matters whether english gentleman likes save skin expense others 
marguerite shivered cold 
ah see resumed chauvelin quietly ladyship quite grasped position 
public crier long way words lingered evening breeze failed reach brain 
suppose colleagues know ingenuity scarlet pimpernel capable directed piloting lady blakeney incidentally abbe foucquet nephew niece safely across channel four people bah bagatelle mighty conspirator lately snatched twenty aristocrats prisons lyons nay nay two children old man enough guard precious hostage thinking either abbe foucquet two children said english gentleman would save expense others 
thinking monsieur chauvelin else set guard prize value highly whole city boulogne replied simply

making clear citizens boulogne day scarlet pimpernel falls hands committee public safety general amnesty granted natives boulogne arrest present time free pardon born within city walls day sentence death noble reward eh well deserved admit wonder whole town boulogne engaged finding mysterious hero delivering hands many mothers sisters wives think present moment would fail lay hands english adventurer husband son life freedom happened stake records continued pointing direction table tell five thirty natives boulogne local prisons dozen prisons paris least twenty tried already condemned death

committee public safety resumed would look upon city nest traitors day scarlet pimpernel becomes prisoner lady blakeney wife notorious english spy already quitted boulogne 
whole town knows hands precious hostage hold ultimate capture man fear detest 
virtually town crier present moment proclaiming inhabitants city want man already wife see citizens escape shall summarily shoot breadwinner every family town cry horror escaped marguerite parched lips 
devils gasped think things aye us devils doubt said chauvelin drily honor us case flattering epithet mere men striving guard property mean harm citizens boulogne 
threatened true elusive pimpernel see threat never put execution would repeated horror stricken 
nay pray fair lady deceive 
present proclamation sounds like mere threat allow let assure fail capture scarlet pimpernel hand spirited fortress mysterious adventurer shall undoubtedly shoot guillotine every able bodied man woman town 
spoken quietly emphatically neither bombast rage marguerite saw face nothing calm ferocious determination determination entire nation embodied one man revenged cost

think lady blakeney added drily making ironical bow humble servant hath outwitted elusive hero last 
quietly turned heel went back room marguerite remaining motionless beside open window soft brine laden air distant murmur sea occasional cry sea mew seemed mock agonizing despair 
voice town crier came nearer nearer could hear words spoke quite distinctly something amnesty pardon reward capture scarlet pimpernel lives men women children exchange 
oh knew meant percy would hesitate one single instant throw life hands enemies exchange others 
others others always others sigh made heart ache often england terrible significance bore would suffer heart pride could even attempt save since would mean death others others always others wondered already landed boulogne remembered vision landing stage massive figure glimpse loved form midst crowd moment entered town would hear proclamation read see posted doubt every public building realize foolish enough follow prisoner could nothing save 
would marguerite thought instinctively pressed hands heart agony become physically painful 
hoped perhaps pain meant approaching death oh easy would simple solution moon peered beneath bank clouds obscured long smiling drew pencilled silver lines along edge towers pinnacles frowning beffroi stony walls seemed marguerite encircled gigantic graveyard 
town crier evidently ceased read proclamation 
one one windows public square lighted within 
citizens boulogne wanted think strange events occurred without knowledge yet apparently direful joyous consequences 
man captured mysterious english adventurer heard nobody seen 
woman wife guarded man safely lock key 
marguerite felt could almost hear talking vowing escape scarlet pimpernel soon captured 
gentle wind stirred old gnarled trees southern ramparts wind sounded like sigh swiftly dying hope 
could percy hands tied inevitably destined endure awful agony seeing woman loved die terrible death beside 
captured would keep long necessity trial detention formalities kind 
summary execution dawn public place roll drums public holiday mark joyful event brave man ceased live noble heart stilled beatings forever whilst whole nation gloried deed 
sleep citizens boulogne still night watchman replaced town crier 
quiet within city walls inhabitants could sleep peace beneficent government wakeful guarding rest 
many windows town remained lighted little distance round corner could see small crowd must collected front gateway led courtyard gayole fort

chauvelin talk bargain would touch percy honor would even think proud ask anything 
chauvelin stood made deep bow crossed room finally went door 
little company soldiers closed around led along dark passages back prison cell 
chapter xxiv colleagues soon door closed behind marguerite came somewhere room sound yawn grunt volley oaths 
flickering light tallow candles failed penetrate corners one dark depths certain something began detach move forward towards table chauvelin resumed seat 
damned aristocrat gone last queried hoarse voice burly body clad loose fitting coat mud stained boots breeches appeared within narrow circle light 
yes replied chauvelin curtly 
cursed long time baggage grunted surlily 
another five minutes taken matter hands 
assumption authority commented chauvelin quietly position entitle citizen collot 
collot herbois lounged lazily forward presently threw ill knit figure chair lately vacated marguerite 
heavy square face bore distinct traces fatigue endured past twenty four hours horseback jolting market waggons 
temper appeared suffered way chauvelin curt dictatorial replies looked surly chained dog 
wasting breath woman muttered bringing large grimy fist heavily table measures quite sound fondly imagine citizen chauvelin 
mostly imagining citizen collot rejoined quietly suggestion 
added touch strength determination mild milk water notions citizen snarled collot spitefully 
knocked intriguing woman brains first possible opportunity consulted earlier 
quite regardless fact violent measures would completely damn chances success far capture scarlet pimpernel concerned remarked chauvelin drily contemptuous shrug shoulders 
wife dead englishman never run head noose carefully prepared 
say chauvelin therefore suggested certain measures prevent woman escaping find adequate hope 
need fear citizen collot said chauvelin curtly woman make attempt escape 
collot herbois swore obscene oath

career doubt man gentle birth gentle breeding called le marquis de chauvelin must suffered susceptibilities pride contact revolutionaries chosen cast lot 
could thrown old ideas refinement quite easily feel happy presence men collot herbois marat day men become brute beats ferocious far wild animal scientifically cruel feline prowler jungle desert 
one look collot distorted face sufficient moment convince chauvelin useless view proclamation citizens boulogne merely idle threat even wished 
marguerite would circumstances attempt escape sir percy blakeney would forced give thoughts rescuing foregone conclusion chauvelin mind high born english gentleman happened selfless hero marguerite blakeney cast different rougher mould short scarlet pimpernel face proclamation succeed dragging wife clutches terrorists equally certain collot herbois would carry rabid cruel reprisals full

chauvelin knew 
nay member called government countenanced butcheries giving unlimited powers men like collot like maignet carriere 
one republican ideas believed regeneration purification france medium guillotine propounded theories carried bloodthirsty schemes physically clean hands immaculately cut coat 
even collot herbois lounged mud bespattered legs stretched dubious linen neck wrists odour rank tobacco stale cheap wine pervading whole personality fastidious man world consorted dandies london brighton winced enforced proximity 
joint characteristic men turned france vast butchery charnel house feared hated one another even whole heartedly hated aristocrats called traitors sent guillotine 
citizen lebon said dipped sword blood flowed guillotine whilst exclaiming comme je l aime ce sang coule de traitre collot danton robespierre fact would regarded delight still blood one colleagues 
moment collot herbois chauvelin would utmost satisfaction denounced one tender mercies public prosecutor 
collot made secret hatred chauvelin latter disguised thinly veneer contemptuous indifference 
dammed englishman added collot slight pause another savage oath tis good fortune lay hands shoot like mad dog rid france forever accursed spy 
think citizen collot rejoined chauvelin shrug shoulders france would rid english adventurers summary death one man ringleader rate least nineteen disciples continue traditions conspiracy intrigue 
none perhaps ingenuous none daring good luck perhaps still number ardent fools ready follow footsteps chief 
halo martyrdom around murdered hero enthusiasm created noble death nay nay citizen lived among english people understand would talk sending popular hero honored grave 
collot herbois shook powerful frame like big sulky dog spat upon floor express contempt wild talk seemed real tangible purpose 
caught scarlet pimpernel yet citizen said snort 
sundown morrow

take fool sneered collot 
foolhardy adventurer

last resource englishman powerful may cause half famished men good deal trouble 
want alive possible dead lion safer live one day 
oh kill right enough citizen 
pray fear 
hold weapon ready meddlesome scarlet pimpernel thousand times deadly effectual chance shot even guillotine 
weapon citizen chauvelin chauvelin leaned forward across table rested chin hands instinctively collot leaned towards men peered furtively round wondering prying eyes happened lurking round 
chauvelin pale eyes gleamed hatred insatiable lust revenge least powerful collot lust blood unsteady light tallow candles threw grotesque shadows across brows mouth set rigid lines implacable cruelty brutish sot beside gazed amazed vaguely scenting depth feeling beyond power comprehend 
repeated question breath weapon mean use accursed spy citizen chauvelin dishonour ridicule replied quietly 
bah exchange life wife

shall rid pestilential english spies entire league scarlet pimpernel become thing past whilom leader thought akin god found refuge suicide grave withering contempt entire world 
chauvelin spoken low hardly whisper echo last words died away great squalid room like long drawn sigh 
dead silence save murmur wind outside floor measured tread sentinel guarding precious hostage 
men staring straight front 
collot herbois incredulous half contemptuous altogether approve schemes seemed wild uncanny like direct simplicity summary trial guillotine well stage managed noyades 
feel ridicule dishonor would necessarily paralyze man efforts intrigue would liked set chauvelin authority aside behead woman upstairs take chances capturing man later 
orders committee public safety peremptory chauvelin help master obey things 
dare take initiative matter case failed reprisals would indeed terrible 
fairly satisfied chauvelin accepted suggestion summarily sending guillotine one member every family resident boulogne marguerite succeeded effecting escape truth chauvelin hailed fiendish suggestion delight 
old abbe nephew niece undoubtedly sufficient deterrents daring schemes scarlet pimpernel matter fact could spirit boulogne easily would wife 
collot plan tied marguerite prison cell completely measure could done indeed originator thereof knew believed man like herbois born gutter imbued every brutish tradition generations jail birds bequeathed would perhaps fully realize fact neither sir percy marguerite blakeney would ever save expense others 
merely made suggestion felt chauvelin plans complicated obscure insufficient perhaps english adventurer wife would succeed outwitting would remain grand bloody compensation wholesale butchery boulogne 
chauvelin quite satisfied 
knew present circumstances neither sir percy marguerite would make attempt escape 
ex ambassador lived england understood class two belonged quite convinced attempt would made either side get lady blakeney away whilst present ferocious order bread winner every family town held good 
aye measures sound enough 
chauvelin easy mind 
another twenty four hours would hold man completely power boldly outwitted last year night would sleep peace entire city guarding precious hostage 
go bed citizen said collot tired sulky moodily fingering papers table 
scraping sound made thereby grated chauvelin overstrung nerves 
wanted alone sleepy brute presence jarred solemn mood 
satisfaction collot grunted surly assent 
leisurely rose chair stretched loose limbs shook like shaggy cur without uttering another word gave colleague curt nod slowly lounged room 
chapter xxv unexpected chauvelin heaved deep sigh satisfaction collot herbois finally left 
listened awhile heavy footsteps died away distance leaning back chair gave delights present situation 
marguerite power 
sir percy blakeney compelled treat rescue wish see die miserable death 
aye elusive hero muttered methinks shall able cry quits last 
outside everything become still 
even wind trees ramparts ceased melancholy moaning 
man alone thoughts 
felt secure peace sure victory content await events next twenty four hours 
side door guard picked amongst feeble ill fed garrison little city attendance person ranged ready respond call 
dishonour ridicule derision scorn murmured gloating sound words expressed hoped accomplish utter abjections perhaps suicide grave loved silence around could murmur words hear echoing bare stone walls like whisperings spirits hate waiting lend aid 
long remained thus absorbed meditations could afterwards said minute two perhaps whilst leaned back chair eyes closed savoring sweets thoughts suddenly silence interrupted loud pleasant laugh drawly voice speaking merry accents lud live monsieur chaubertin pray propose accomplish pleasant things moment chauvelin feet eyes dilated lips parted awed bewilderment gazing towards open window astride upon sill one leg inside room moon shining full suit delicate colored cloth wide caped coat elegant chapeau bras sat imperturbably sir percy

moreover fact whenever wherever scarlet pimpernel least expected would surely appear realized wife incarcerated fort gayole natural would go prowl around prison along avenue summit southern ramparts accessible every passer doubt lain hiding among trees perhaps caught snatches chauvelin recent talk collot
