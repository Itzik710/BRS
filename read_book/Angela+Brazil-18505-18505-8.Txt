laid set standard tone school think kept fairly well whole 
rainbow league seems thoroughly established likely go 
may read things done year made four pounds war orphans fund sent ninety seven home made toys poor children treats 
posy union gave nine pots crocuses fifty six bunches flowers cripples invalids penny week subscriptions kept two little girls summer children camp needlework guild made thirty seven garments 
sound much put hard black white like hate reports statistics societies always sound somehow pharisaical saying look good know mean 
mean though tried run everything entirely 
rainbow shines world clearing perhaps little efforts small show things moving right direction 
next term us girls sixth left new set take lead 
say yet head school fancy much doubt 
hope whoever reins keep worked hard year 
lispeth looking straight ingred spoke meaning unmistakable 
ingred blushed faint rosy pink 
dawned upon next term would possibly bring greatest honor college confer 
whoever chosen head girl stammered bashfully sure try best work good school 
done probably half well make enormous effort shall say carry
