sheltered side steamer long lines passengers stretched wicker chairs smoking drinking coffee one came save occasional promenader 
yet even disappointment 
come peace brief escape thrall memories last hours become charged undreamed horrors peace 
shadowy darkness rested upon white churned sea flying past saw horrible distinctness face figure man brief minutes hated desperate passionate hatred 
saw broken photograph glass splintered thousand pieces 
saw man choking sinking beneath black waters heard stifled cry palsied lips saw slow dawning agony death distorted features 
one playing mandolin second class 
heard feet dancer upon deck little murmur applause 
well life 
rebuke fate illogical useless vapourings 
men died every second whilst women danced one knew life care save measure days 
freakish thought pleaded stridently justification 
mind traveled back gloomy avenues past along last aching years grinding undeserved poverty 
remembered upbringing widowed mother woman used every luxury struggling make ends meet suburban street hired cottage filled hired furniture 
remembered schooldays devoid pocket money unable join sports others slaving melancholy perseverance scholarship lighten mother burden 
always ghastly crushing penuriousness struggle make living schooldays well unbought books fingered bookstalls let drop coarse clothes compelled wear scanty food eaten narrow driving ways poverty culminating mother death fear age nineteen years lest money funeral forthcoming 
hell surely lived whose flames mocked could worse 
sin crime remembered words girl latter years represented might light life 
remembered seemed could meet ghostly image risen black waters without shrinking almost contemptuously 
fate mocked long enough 
time indeed helped 
swung away solitude side steamer paused sheltered spot lit cigarette paced frequented ways

hideous vision loomed many moments depression slowly reforming time still watches night broad daylight spring sunshine cheer heart roar friendly city ears 
time dreams yet felt misery sweeping upon felt cold shivers ineffective struggles 
slowly fateful panorama unfolded memory 
saw step glad relief uncomfortable nauseous third class carriage clutching humble little present hand cross flinty platform climb long rain swept hill keeping head upraised though sky seemed grimy battling miserable depression everlasting ugliness
