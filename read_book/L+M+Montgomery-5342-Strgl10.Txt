could black cat peg nonsense still look like ordinary cat 
large green malicious eyes plainly something common beastie tense breathless silence story girl placed parcels lowest step laid letter top pile 
brown fingers trembled face pale 
suddenly door us opened peg bowen appeared threshold 
tall sinewy old woman wearing short ragged drugget skirt reached scantly knees scarlet print blouse man hat 
feet arms neck bare battered old clay pipe mouth 
brown face seamed hundred wrinkles tangled grizzled hair fell unkemptly shoulders 
scowling flashing black eyes held friendly light 
borne bravely enough hitherto spite inward unconfessed quakings 
strained nerves gave way sheer panic seized us 
peter gave little yelp pure terror 
turned fled across clearing woods 
long hill tore like mad hunted creatures firmly convinced peg bowen us 
wild scamper nightmare like recorded dream books 
story girl front recall tremendous leaps made fallen logs little spruce bushes long brown curls streaming behind scarlet fillet 
cecily behind kept gasping contradictory sentences oh bev wait oh bev hurry hurry blind instinct anything else kept together found way woods

argued would make quite lawful proper play sunday 
desirous convinced also thought merry hour lazarus martha moses aaron sundry worthies holy writ lively time king orchard 
peter scriptural name want take another would allow would give unfair advantage rest us 
would much easier call name fit tongue unfamiliar one 
peter retaliated choosing nebuchadnezzar one could ever utter three times peter shrieked

urged responsibility concerning meant wind reciting solemn earnest voice verse beginning whose souls lighted 
completed sermon went carefully wrote red ink cecily made aniline dye word thump wherever deemed advisable chastise pulpit 
sermon still red thumps unfaded lying beside dream book going inflict readers 
proud

dan passed plate felicity rosebud plate looking preternaturally solemn elder frewen 
every one put cent 
well preached sermon 
fell horribly flat 
realized half way 
think preached well never thump forget misplace 
audience plainly bored 
stepped pulpit demanding passionately whose souls lighted forth felt secret humiliation sermon failure 
made impression 
felix would sure get prize 
good sermon first attempt said story girl graciously 
sounded like real sermons heard 
moment charm voice made feel done badly girls thinking duty pay sort compliment also quickly dispelled pleasing delusion 
every word true said cecily tone unconsciously implying sole merit 
often feel said felicity primly think enough heathens 
ought think great deal 
sara ray put finishing touch mortification 
nice short said 
matter sermon asked dan night 
since neither judge competitor could discuss matter

black eyes shone black curls brushed quite ministerial pompador threatened tumble top graceless ringlets 
decided use waiting sara ray might might come according humor mother 
therefore peter proceeded service 
read chapter gave hymn much sang froid life 
mr marwood could bettered way peter said sing whole hymn omitting fourth stanza 
fine touch thought 
began think peter might foeman worthy steel 
peter ready begin thrust hands pockets totally unorthodox thing 
plunged without ado speaking ordinary conversational tone another unorthodox thing 
shorthand reporter present take sermon necessary could preach verbatim doubt could everyone heard 
forgettable kind sermon 
dearly beloved said peter sermon bad place short hell 
electric shock seemed run audience 
everybody looked suddenly alert 
peter one sentence done whole sermon failed 
made impression

first head must want go bad place 
second head bad place like sensation audience third head escape going 
great many things must important know
