end world madame francois used say 
load vegetable leaves discharged 
claude florent would hear journeyman gardener planting lettuces leaving work armed pitchforks proceeded toss leaves manure pit 
occupation afforded much amusement 
claude quite liking manure since symbolises world life 
strippings parings vegetables scourings markets refuse fell colossal table remained full life returned spot vegetables previously sprouted warm nourish fresh generations cabbages turnips carrots 
rose fertile crops went spread upon market square 
paris rotted everything returned everything soil never wearied repairing ravages death 
ah exclaimed claude plied fork last time cabbage stalk sure recognize 
grown least half score times corner yonder apricot tree 
remark made florent laugh 
soon became grave strolled slowly kitchen garden claude made sketch stable madame francois got breakfast ready 
kitchen garden long strip ground divided middle narrow path rose slightly top end raising head could perceive low barracks mont valerien 
green hedges separated plots land lofty walls hawthorn fringed horizon curtain greenery wise surrounding country mont valerien alone seemed rise inquisitively tip toe order peer madame francois close 
great peacefulness came countryside could seen 
along kitchen garden four hedges may sun shone languid heat silence disturbed buzzing insects somnolence suggestive painless parturition 
every faint cracking sound soft sigh made one fancy one could hear vegetables sprout 
patches spinach sorrel borders radishes carrots turnips beds potatoes cabbages spread even regularity displaying dark leaf mould tufts greenery 
farther away trenched lettuces onions leeks celery planted line long straight rows looked like soldiers parade peas beans beginning twine slender tendrils round forest sticks june came would transform thick verdant wood 
weed seen 
garden resembled two parallel strips carpet geometrical pattern green reddish ground carefully swept every morning 
borders thyme grew like greyish fringe along side pathway 
florent paced backwards forwards amidst perfume thyme sun warming 
felt profoundly happy peacefulness cleanliness garden 
nearly year past seen vegetables bruised crushed jolting market carts vegetables torn previous evening still bleeding 
rejoiced find home peace dark mould sound every part 
cabbages bulky prosperous appearance carrots looked bright gay lettuces lounged line air careless indolence 
looked markets left behind morning seemed like vast mortuary abode death corpses could found charnel house reeking foul smells putrefaction 
slackened steps rested kitchen garden long perambulation amidst deafening noises repulsive odours 
uproar sickening humidity fish market departed felt though born anew pure fresh air 
claude right thought 
markets sphere death 
soil life eternal cradle health world 
omelet ready suddenly cried madame francois 
three seated round table kitchen door thrown open sunshine ate breakfast light hearted gaiety madame francois looked florent amazement repeating mouthful quite altered 
ten years younger 
villainous paris makes seem gloomy
