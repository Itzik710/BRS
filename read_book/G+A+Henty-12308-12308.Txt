first arrived left swilling beer devouring pies provisions cooked last night hear set forth soon last comer arrived 
whichever quarry try fall upon news arrival bruited abroad 
wave hand falconer boy started 
leaving road striking across slightly undulated country dotted groups trees lad ran brisk trot without stopping halt breathe half hour run arrived entrance building whose aspect proclaimed abode saxon franklin importance 
would called castle rather fortified house windows looking without surrounded moat crossed drawbridge capable sustaining anything short real attack 
erstwood lately passed norman hands indeed present owned saxon 
sir william de lance father lad entering portals friend follower earl evesham soon lord married gweneth heiress fair lands given king death father became ward sir william married editha daughter heiress franklin erstwood cousin dear friend new countess evesham 
neither couple could marriage first called one inclination part ladies love came marriage 
although knights barons norman invasion would doubt considered rude rough days broadcloth civilization yet manners gentle polished side rough though kindly saxon franklins although saxon maids doubtless patriotic fathers mothers yet female mind greatly led gentle manners courteous address 
thus bidden forced give hands norman knights speedily accepted lot part grew contented happy enough 
changed circumstances pleasanter ride side norman husbands surrounded gay cavalcade hawk hunt discharge quiet duties mistress saxon farm house 
many cases course lot rendered wretched violence brutality lords majority well satisfied lot mixed marriages bring peoples together weld one laws decrees norman sovereigns 
certainly case editha whose marriage sir william one greatest happiness 
lost three years story begins fighting normandy one innumerable wars first norman kings constantly involved 
entering gates erstwood cuthbert rushed hastily room mother sitting three four maidens engaged work 
want speak mother said 
son said mother still young comely 
waving hand girls left 
mother said alone fear sir walter make great raid upon outlaws 
armed men coming morning castles round baron de wortham preparations intended methinks must needs landless men 
would cuthbert mother asked anxiously 
found meddling matters 
present stand well favor earl loves sake wife kin father good liegeman service 
mother many friends wood 
cnut chief first cousin many others friends good men true though forced cruel norman laws refuge woods 
would mother asked 
would take ronald pony ride warn danger threatens 
best go foot son 
doubtless men set see none saxon homesteads carry warning woods 
distance beyond reach often wandered foot evade eye watchers one thing son must promise case earl bands meet outlaws take part fray struggle 
willingly mother said 
cause offence castle forest blood kin 
would fain save shedding blood quarrel like 
hope time may come saxon norman may fight side side maybe see 
minutes later changed blue doublet one sober less noticeable color cuthbert started great forest stretched within mile erstwood 
days large part country covered forest policy normans preserving woods chase tended prevent increase cultivation 
farms cultivated lands held saxons although nominally handed nobles william successors given fiefs saw little norman masters 
stood indeed much position landlords stand tenants payment made part produce 
edge wood trees grew comparatively far apart cuthbert proceeded farther recesses trees virgin forest stood thick close together 
open glades ran across sharp eye accustomed forest could often see stags starting away sound footsteps 
full hour journey cuthbert reached point bound 
open space probably cleared storm ages overshadowed giant trees group men ages appearances 
occupied stripping skin buck hung bough one trees 
others roasting portions carcass another deer 
sat apart talking others busy making arrows lay asleep greensward 
cuthbert entered clearing several party rose feet 
ah cuthbert shouted man almost gigantic stature appeared one leaders party brings lad early wont visit us till even lay crossbow stag moonlight 
cousin cnut cuthbert said thou canst say ever broken forest laws though looked often often whilst done 
abettor bad thief laughed cnut foresters caught us act wot would make little difference whether shaft longbow quarrel thy crossbow brought quarry 
lad comest thou see sweat face heaving sides run fast far 
cnut stopped breathing since left erstwood 
come warn danger 
earl preparing raid 
cnut laughed somewhat disdainfully 
raided trow carried game 
landless men forest hold handful norman knights retainers home 
ay said cuthbert common raid 
morning bands holds within miles round riding least men arms likely chase today 
said cnut exclamations surprise apprehension broke standing round 
lad done us good service indeed 
fair warning slip fingers ten times men came upon us unawares hemmed us would fare badly us though doubt give good account battle axes maces ended strife 
idea road enter forest intentions know cuthbert said gathered earl intended sweep forest put end breaches laws say rough treatment foresters met hands 
best methinks sir walter heavily armed men 
forest large scarce hold methinks best shift quarters langholm chase storm passed 
langholm said cnut though love place 
sir john wortham worse neighbor far earl 
latter bear malice good knight fair lord could free norman notions birds air beasts field fishes water belong normans saxons share quarrel 
grinds neighbors content fair tithe produce man man fair judge without favor 
baron fiend incarnate fear would lose would gladly cut throats burn drown hang every saxon within twenty miles hold 
disgrace order day band gathers little stronger burn nest ears 
hard nut crack cuthbert said laughing 
arms forest enterprise would something akin scaling skies 
ladders axes go far lad norman men arms learned dread shafts 
enough baron must neighbors time 
heard mates said turning comrades gathered around cuthbert tells us 
opinion better move away till storm past fight heavy odds without much chance either booty victory general chorus proclaimed outlaws approved proposal move langholm chase 
preparations simple 
bows taken boughs hanging quivers slung across backs short cloaks thrown shoulders 
deer hurriedly dismembered joints fastened pole slung shoulders two men 
drinking cups silver looking strangely place among rough horn implements platters bundled together carried short distance dropped among thick bushes safety band started wortham 
cordial farewell many thanks cuthbert declined invitations accompany retreat langholm commenced 
cuthbert knowing direction bands likely approach remained motionless intently listening 
quarter hour heard distant note bugle

sound distant voices breaking branches knew one least parties near hand rapidly climbed thick tree ensconced branches watched secure hidden sharpest eye passage body men arms fully hundred strong led sir walter accompanied half dozen knights 
passed cuthbert slipped tree made speed home 
reached far knew without observed single passer 
brief talk mother started castle appearance would divert suspicion might arise would also appear natural seeing movements large body men go gossip acquaintances 
distant mile evesham came upon small party

cuthbert great favorite earl daughter frequently brought pets nests young owlets falcons creatures join party clump trees near burst body ten mounted men 
without word rode straight astonished group 
retainers cut ground thought drawing sword defense 
nurse slain blow battle axe margaret snatched palfrey thrown across saddle bow one mounted men comrades dashed full speed 
chapter ii

whole startling scene abduction earl evesham daughter occupied seconds 
cuthbert astounded sudden calamity remained rooted ground spot fortunately unnoticed assailants stood first burst concealment 
short time hesitated course take 
men arms remained castle scarce strong enough rescue child whose captors would doubt reinforced far stronger party lurking near 
main body sir walter followers deep recesses forest lay altogether line wortham would chance whatever bringing time cut marauders way back 
remained outlaws time would langholm forest perhaps within mile two castle 
road horsemen would travel would far longer direct line across country resolved strain every nerve reach friends time get interpose captors lady margaret stronghold 
instant hesitated whether run back erstwood get horse decided would quick go foot far easier find outlaws 
thoughts occupied moments started top speed long run across country 
cuthbert running race hare hound would assuredly borne away prize boys age 
headlong pace made across country every foot far edge langholm chase knew heart 
distance woods twelve miles hour half moment starting cuthbert deep within shades 
would likely find outlaws knew putting whistle lips shrilly blew signal would knew recognized band within hearing 
thought heard answer certain dashed forward almost speedily started 
five minutes later man stood glade running 
recognized one cnut party 
band gasped 
half mile right replied man 
guided man cuthbert ran full speed till panting scarce able speak arrived spot cnut band gathered 
words told happened although chased father captured child moment hesitation promising aid rescue man regarded far bitter enemy race 
fear shall late cut cnut said long start least waste time gossiping 
winding horn call together members band scattered leaving one meeting place give instructions rest cnut followed assembled went swinging trot glades towards wortham castle 
rapid calculation distances allowing fact baron men knowing sir walter retainers friends deep forest even heard outrage could traces hours would take matters quietly cnut concluded arrived time 
turning made way along edge wood point road evesham ran forest 
scarcely party reached point heard faint clatter steel 
come exclaimed cuthbert 
cnut gave rapid directions band took posts behind trees either side path 
remember cnut said things careful hit child pierce horse riding 
instant falls rush forward

several arrows flew one two struck horse rode 
animal however kept way 
cuthbert levelled crossbow low arm tree rider came abreast touched trigger steel pointed quarrel flew true strong temple passing horseman 
fell horse like stone well trained animal stood still side rider 
cuthbert leapt forward delight child opened arms cried joyous tone cuthbert fight still raging fiercely cuthbert raising ground ran wood remained hidden combat ceased last survivors baron band ridden past towards castle 
cuthbert went forward charge joined band outlaws absorbed fight witnessed incident rescue received loud shouts joy triumph 
good day work indeed cuthbert said make earl firm friend instead bitter enemy doubt better days dawning evesham forest 
litter speedily made boughs margaret placed shoulders two stout foresters started home cnut cuthbert walking beside band keeping short distance behind sort rear guard baron attempt regain prey 
cause speed cuthbert truth could scarce drag one foot another already traversed twenty miles greater portion distance highest rate speed 
cnut offered litter made also cuthbert indignantly refused however forest came upon hut small cultivator rough forest pony borrowed cuthbert use 
late afternoon came sight evesham castle 
distance could seen bodies armed men galloping towards clear party returning wood learned news disappearance earl daughter finding bodies attendants 
presently met one mounted retainers riding headlong speed 
heard seen anything shouted approached lady margaret missing foul play taken place 
rudolph cried child sitting rude litter 
horseman gave cry astonishment pleasure without word wheeled horse galloped past back headlong speed towards castle 
cuthbert party approached gate earl surrounded knights followers rode hastily gate halted front little party 
litter lowered dismounted horse daughter sprang leapt arms 
minutes confusion babble tongues great anything heard cuthbert soon order somewhat restored stated happened earl moved fury news outrage perpetrated baron wortham upon daughter gates castle also thought saved bravery devotion men lately vowing vengeance depths forest

cuthbert returned home tired delighted day work dame editha surprised indeed tale adventure tell 
next morning went castle heard grand council held evening determined attack wortham castle raze ground 
immediately hearing arrival earl expressing gratitude rescue daughter asked would go forest invite outlaws join forces castle attack baron 
cuthbert willingly undertook mission felt alliance would strengthen position forest men

cuthbert returned news gave great satisfaction earl 
castle scene bustle business armourers work repairing head pieces breastplates sharpening swords battle axes fletchers prepared sheaves arrows 
courtyard number men engaged oiling catapults ballistas machines hurling stones 
discussing chances assault easy matter set 
wortham hold extremely strong one needed machines disposal undertake formidable operation siege 
garrison strong desperate baron knowing must follow outrage day would sure send messengers round country begging friends come assistance

reply summons burst taunting laughter walls scarcely herald withdrawn flight arrows showed besieged perfectly ready fray

therefore time quietly accumulating large store provisions munitions war strengthening castle every way 
moat cleaned filled brim water 
great quantities heavy stones accumulated exposed points walls readiness hurl upon might try climb 
huge sheaves arrows piles crossbow bolts readiness save number men wortham weeks prepared siege 
day attempt carry earl daughter failed baron seeing bold stroke obtain hostage would enabled make terms earl thwarted knew struggle inevitable 
fleet messengers sent directions

said defend hold weeks 
aid without finally hope break power braggart earl 
many addressed call speedily complied demand distance might expected reply later appeal 
many among barons considered mildness earl evesham towards saxons district mistake although actually approving tyranny brutality baron wortham yet looked upon cause extent 
castle wortham stood upon ground slightly elevated surrounding country 
deep wide moat ran round could diverting rivulet filled 
edge moat walls rose high strong flanking towers battlements

band headed cnut two three strongest party entered passage 
cuthbert misgivings mother injunctions take part fray said accompanying foresters obeyed letter instructions 
time felt sure effect surprise would complete crushing party would gain top keep without serious resistance considered risk small justify accompanying foresters 
passage five feet high little two feet wide 
dry dusty save marks ground human foot going returning doubtless man oiled lock day passage appeared unused time left hands builders 
passing along distance came another strong oaken door 
like last yielded efforts crowbars foresters advanced 
presently came flight steps

mounting steps came third door thickly studded iron appeared great strength 
fortunately lock upon side enabled shoot bolt upon side door firmly secured large bolts fully five minutes foresters could succeed opening 
without good deal noise last several times paused fearing alarm must given castle 
however door remained closed supposed occupants fully engaged defending attacks earl party

fate better perished hungary bulgaria 
grievous suffering loss last reached nicaea 
fell ambuscade whole undisciplined masses followed peter hermit doubtful whether ever returned home 
first attempt rescue holy sepulchre followed others equally wild misguided unfortunate 
indeed began evil deeds soon left home 
last bodies fell upon jews indeed enemies christian faith least nothing question holy sepulchre

news victory led armies crusaders follow example godfrey almost completely without organization leadership peter hermit suffered miserably way indeed ever reached holy land 
godfrey died brother baldwin succeeded 
history last years full fresh efforts crush moslem power hitherto said fortune attended efforts christians 
indeed devotion knights st john templars two great companies formed men devoted lives holding sepulchre infidel hold holy land would lost 
gradually saracens wrested post post hands 
edessa taken news event created intense excitement 
holy st bernard stirred france louis vii 
took vow headed noble army 
ways god ways although army germany joined france little results came great effort 
emperor conrad germans attacked turk saladin iconium defeated loss men 
king france army also attacked fury large portion force slaughtered 
nothing came great effort first crusade seemed show men arms europe irresistible second contrary gave proof turks equal christian knights 
gradually christian hold holy land shaken 
although fighting extraordinary bravery small army christian knights temple st john annihilated king jerusalem made prisoner christian power crushed 
saladin commanded turks advanced jerusalem forced capitulate 
boy last sad news reached us wonder stirred hearts monarchs europe every effort made recapture holy sepulchre avenge brethren murdered infidels 
father francis story would seem europe already sacrificed enormous number lives take holy sepulchre fighting taken lose 
son trust future things better managed 
templars hospitallers number vast number best lances europe grown great powers may believe wrested holy sepulchre hands infidels able maintain assaults 
doubtless great misfortunes fallen upon christian armies punishment heaven gone work right spirit 
enough take lance shield place red cross upon shoulder 
desire fight battle lord must cleanse hearts go forth spirit pilgrims rather knights 
mean trust wholly spiritual weapons truth infidel foe despised mean lay aside thoughts worldly glory rivalry one another 
think father spirit king richard kings nobles preparing go holy land animated father francis hesitated 
son judge motives speak well ill instruments chosen great work 
works praiseworthy holy 
horrible think holy shrines jerusalem hands men believe redeemer hold duty every man bear arms matter rank station armor go forth battle cause 
whether success crown effort whether god wills otherwise man discuss enough work duty 
think father good england son whether gain holy land 
methinks good service nation saxon norman fight together holy cross 
hitherto races stood far much apart 
seen bad qualities rather good methinks saxon norman stand side side soil holy land shout together england must needs bind together lead feel longer normans saxons englishmen 
intend preach village green evesham next sunday morning subject know communication forest men would cuthbert would persuade come hear 
wondering could found vagrants 
many long since lost habits honest labor 
many still serfs although freed good earl knights followers

hence war resolved series expeditions detached fights 
british camp thoroughly fortified thence parties knights sallied engaged conflicts saracens varying success

looking round high walls surrounded garden cuthbert said could think plan whatever escaping place often thought appeared hopeless 
even manage scale walls would find town beyond escape would altogether hopeless 
said transported country palace governor could ever hope make escape 
next night messenger brought news mistress disposed favor escape way pointed would two three days ask governor permission pay visit palace beyond walls would take number gardeners among cuthbert beautify place 
cuthbert returned lively hearty thanks patroness kind intentions hope began rise rapidly heart

end month news came england sir baldwin b thune returned bearing news king arrested gortz two days journey north adriatic recognized captured 
offered resistance finding indeed would hopeless 
sir baldwin permitted depart without molestation 
believed folk whose hands fallen retainers archduke john

cuthbert determined return england see sir baldwin ascertain steps taken discovery prison king richard confined release therefrom also establish new dignity earl evesham 
therefore bidding adieu duke duchess started north 
duke furnished letters introduction princes whose countries would travel crossing rhine journeyed territories dukes cleves brabant reached mouth scheldt without interruption 
taking ship sailed london 
long stormy passage mouth scheldt london 
vessel cuthbert shipped old somewhat unseaworthy several times force gale board gave hope lives 
last however reached mouth thames dropping tide reached london eight days embarcation 
noble charger king saxony presented cuthbert suffered greatly feared one time poor animal would succumb effects tempest 
however entering smooth water recovered landing near tower found able support weight 
cnut archers like cuthbert delighted feet upon english soil although london strike wonder would done first visited starting journey many respects greatly behind continental cities yet feeling home pleasure able understand conversation around made poor fellows almost beside joy 
beyond main political incidents cuthbert heard little passed england since departure putting hostelry inquired host whether sir baldwin b thune london whether away estates 
landlord know 
said nobles court london never dull present 
cuthbert wish coming home known john learned something position affairs despatched cnut tower inquire privately officials place whether sir baldwin 
cnut soon returned news court since return holy land living castle dorsetshire 
hesitation cuthbert resolved set see friend six days travel arrived castle knight 
sir baldwin received immense joy 
heard since parted zara feared fate similar befallen king richard overtaken cuthbert even still alive 
seen aught king master good knight inquired 
nothing cuthbert said 
know 
indeed hoped learned something king 
separated gortz taken prisoner archduke allowed pursue way 
many difficulties dangers weeks finding way back 
nothing known king returned 
indeed first bearer definite news concerning since day sailed acre 
three weeks ago may learned news came detained captivity emperor demanded delivery archduke john whose hands first fell 
one exactly knows 
news created immense excitement kingdom resolved sacrifice treasures may demanded order satisfy ransom recreant emperor placed upon king 
shame indeed christian sovereign hold another captivity 
still returning dominions crusader coming holy land person safe even deadliest enemy 
long suspected hands either emperor archduke throughout europe feeling indignation strong doubt truth known feeling stronger ever 
known cuthbert said suppose delay ransoming king 
delay raising ransom sir baldwin said 
kingdom impoverished war exactions prince john langley held king richard 
loyal servant king exacting rapacious prelate 
however doubt rents english nobles soon charged sums sufficient ransom avail one grudge silver flagons vessels melt make total required 
must flatter obtain liberty soon money raised 
prince john long yearning sovereignty 
long exercised real nominal power intriguing pope phillip france support seizing crown 
throw every obstacle way may sure phillip france richard deadly enemy 
sir cuthbert tell befallen since last met 
cuthbert related adventures befallen heard sir baldwin 
suppose latter remarked yet seen prince john cuthbert replied thought better come ask advise position affairs attempted see 
well sir baldwin said 
arrived found proper officials according king richard instructions drawn patent conferring upon lands title earl evesham leaving acre received king signature 
attested several nobles us returned safely england 
prince john however declared give heed document king richard power realm ceased made bestow earldom upon whomsoever chose 
matter fact given sir rudolph fleming norman knight creature prince 
king also hear promised hand young lady margaret shall become marriageable age 
present placed convent worcester 
abbess believe friend late earl girl time previously 
indeed went think father left england 
lady ordered give charge guardianship sir rudolph refused saying would convenable young lady guardianship bachelor knight lady head establishment therefore retain spite orders prince 
prince john hear flew fury dare provoke anger whole clergy ordering convent violated 
indeed would clergy indignant many great nobles would also taken part doubt contention abbess reasonable among friends king richard strong feeling anger deprived earldom 
however far found much vent words uncertain whether would ever return claim rights worth one embroil unnecessarily prince upon subject 
god knows subjects enough dispute john lackland english barons without fresh ones arising 
whole kingdom state disturbance 
several risings prince john authority far suppressed 
know king richard hope return ere long probable peace maintained treachery prevail king richard return prevented may sure john permitted mount throne without determined resistance large number nobles 
cuthbert said john successor throne 
prince arthur brittany named king richard first successor 
blood right john pretence throne long lives 
sir baldwin said 
unhappily england present might makes right may sure king richard death may prince john make bold throw throne aided pope phillip france methinks chances better young prince 
man power warlike times boy intrigue promise threaten boy must hands partisans 
fear prince arthur troubled times indeed mounts throne england 
richard survive becomes age take field head armies may succeed speak well boy singular sweetness disposition prince john detested save flatter live 
enough present politics cuthbert let us table 
long since two feasted together indeed meals took holy land could scarcely called feasts 
boar head good roasted capon worthy strange dishes 
always misdoubted meat seemed smack flavor saracens never could bring inquire whence strange food obtained 
stoup english ale worth cyprus wines especially cyprus wines half full sand desert 
pah makes throat dry think horrible meals 
brought cnut four archers safely back yes cuthbert said smiling assure heavy weight spite faithfulness fidelity 
ignorance language brought troubles upon cnut something nature bull 
certain things stomach seeth rageth like wild beast regardless altogether safety convenience 
evening two knights talked course cuthbert adopt 
elder knight opinion young friend best formally claim title writing king arms also announce return prince john signing sir cuthbert earl evesham present state things would unwise attempt regain position certain case prince john refuse recognize 
young yet sir baldwin said eighteen think afford wait rate see whether king richard returns 
come back see wrongs righted one first cares would assuredly cast usurper stolen dignities 
old lady margaret fifteen cuthbert said 
three years younger wish younger sir baldwin said 
fifteen custom fairly marriageable men strain points choose fear news coming hasten prince sir rudolph determination strengthen claim usurper marriage heiress evesham 
lady margaret friends course claim royal ward king alone dispose person estates 
unfortunately force overrides argument 
surely cuthbert said never venture take force convent venture great many strange things england sir baldwin said worcester perilously near evesham 
clump twenty spears sir rudolph might break convent carry young lady marry force although church might cry crying would little avail deed done handsome present part sir rudolph might go far shut mouths many complainants especially able say king sanction 
methinks cuthbert said case would perilous indeed wait king richard return 
assuredly sir rudolph would tarry attained age seventeen may well two years may yet pass king richard comes back 
seems wiser part give prince john notice england 
say notice would avail recovering lands title would put prince upon guard assuredly minions would press forward measures obtain possession person lady margaret hand harm come maintaining silence 
think right sir cuthbert 
indeed best enemies suppose either dead dungeon tyrol 
would would return old home cuthbert said 
lady mother trust still alive 
appear house take refuge forest 
cnut archers one time outlaws living doubt many good men true still found woods 
others assuredly join learn cnut wanted strike blow rights 
shall bide time 
keep strict watch castle convent 
abbess friend relative lady margaret may obtain interview warn dangers await ask willing fulfil promise father king richard accepting husband due time shall arrive whether willing take steps may deliver persecution sir rudolph 
trust assents keep watch convent well castle either attack latter carry former occasion may appear warrant 
plenty snug cottages round forest remain concealment care good farmer wife months shall close hand watch 
aid forest men sir walter took castle sir john wortham although evesham far grander pile yet methinks could carried sudden assault know war 
prince john may deny right earl evesham methinks many months choose become master 
hasty matter sir baldwin said 
might capture castle aid outlaws could scarcely hold 
prince ere aid faithful foreign mercenaries captured stronger holds evesham turn favorite would swarm hornets around walls evesham could keep 
would therefore worse useless attempt would something like act rebellion prince john authority would give excuse ground putting price upon head cutting got opportunity 
might present boldly court although might refuse recognize title earl yet knight crusader distinguished greatly holy land dare interfere person would resented whole chivalry england 
still agree best course keep return secret 
unwatched unnoticed enemies take time carrying designs effect 
two days later cuthbert attended faithful retainers left sir baldwin castle traveled easy stages wiltshire confines gloucestershire worcester 
supplied sir baldwin suitable attire followers rode simple knight without arms cognizance journeying one part another 
crosses crusading signs laid aside nothing attract attention upon passage 
cuthbert first thought going direct convent worcester asking interview lady margaret reflected might possible myrmidons sir rudolph might keeping watch building see lady margaret secretly removed place refuge appearance knight doors would excite comment suspicion 
therefore avoided town journeyed straight forest often roamed cnut outlaws 
found matters little changed since last 
many fought holy land returned sea taken forest joined many new men exactions sir rudolph already goaded revolt 
cnut received enthusiasm presented cuthbert rightful heir evesham well known friend foresters enthusiasm knew bounds 
accepted lord master promised obey orders lay lives necessary cause knew formally obtained pardon forest band fought attack wortham castle 
cuthbert great delight heard mother good health although months grievously fretting disappearance supposed death 
cuthbert hesitated whether proceed see feared shock appearance might much expressions joy might make retainers others aware arrival news might way reach ears castle 
therefore despatched cnut see break news cautiously request arrange time would either see cuthbert place distance house would arrange domestics absent would interview unobserved 
cnut absent hours return told cuthbert seen dame editha joy hearing son safe arrival caused harm rather reverse 
news king richard bestowed upon title lands evesham new astonished indeed hear elevation 
heard much character pretending earl great fears safety cuthbert residence neighborhood get ears although sure fidelity retainers feared joy young master return might let slip incautious word would come ears castle 
therefore determined meet distance 
arranged upon following day would give intended make pilgrimage shrine st dunstan lay edge forest thank recovery illness pray safety son 
would carried thither litter journey would excite comment whatever 
would take four trusted retainers would arrival shrine send distance order pay devotions undisturbed 
cuthbert near moment saw depart enter 
arrangement carried joy dame editha meeting son deep indeed 
left lad fifteen 
returned youth nearly eighteen stout strong beyond age looking far older effect hot sun syria hardships gone 
win spurs upon first opportunity earl promised doubted would soon attain rank father held 
return belted earl beyond wildest thoughts 
however little mind 
son earl evesham clasped arms 
interview must necessarily short one cuthbert gave slight outline happened since parted conversation turned upon present position upon steps best taken 
peril fear great fighting infidels holy land said 
sir rudolph long proved cruel ruthless master 
driven forth many old tenants bestowed lands upon servants retainers 
forest laws carries fullest severity hung several men caught infringing 
laid heavy burdens tenants remain fairly ruined stay long rule desert

think even minion prince john would dare violate sanctity convent 
fear good mother cuthbert said ambition greed one scale reverence holy church weigh much 
king richard killed upon way home long nothing heard sir rudolph might content allow matters remain least lady margaret attained age would justify demanding espousal carried 
news positively ascertained king hands emperor knowledge sooner later freedom obtained hasten friends usurper make advantage 
knows king would upon return annul nomination sir rudolph earldom previously bestowed upon 
may well think time secure marriage person late earl daughter small share domains may allotted dowry even obliged lay borrowed honors 
unless greatly mistaken hear long 
abbess looked grave

said well holy mother sir cuthbert said 
see hawks scent danger afar moving uneasily already 
whether consider pressing dare profane convent know

bethink thee lady whether would safer send lady margaret care person may concealed search sir rudolph

difficult indeed young lady rank concealed sharp searchers sir rudolph would certain place upon track

way detracted determination defend castle last yet rendered task far lighter agreeable one would seen gallows standing end siege 
testudo called days advanced towards castle machines upon walls catapults mangonels arbalasts poured forth showers stones darts upon breaking array shields killing many openings made archers seizing time poured volleys arrows 
mercenaries however accustomed war advanced steadily made good footing beneath castle wall proceeded rear ladders

defenders poured showers boiling pitch oil penetrated crevices armor caused intolerable torment 
great stones toppled battlements upon sometimes ladders seized poles hooks cast backwards upon throng 
half hour encouraged shouts sir rudolph leaders soldiers strove gallantly last compelled draw lost nigh men without one gaining footing upon walls 
evening another council war held without

valiantly garrison oppose efforts 
day showed progress made besiegers 
forces increased prince john ordered captain gloucester send another men assistance sir rudolph

larger first overtopped castle walls 
upper story drawbridges formed drop structures upon walls thus enable besiegers rush upon
