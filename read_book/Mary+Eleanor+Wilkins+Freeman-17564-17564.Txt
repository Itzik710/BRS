could even evelyn 
alone knowledge gained father state health 
sat little chair window baby chair kept years could still sit comfortably slender 
put face hands began weep 
never wept even mother died 
much younger mother died sensibilities acquired full acumen time awful foretaste desolate future tinctured bitter soul 
somehow although maria noticed long time father look done never occurred happened mother could happen father 
like one house struck lightning rendered thereby incredulous second stroke 
occurred whereas lost mother could also lose father 
seemed like heavy hammer stroke providence believe keep reason 
thought father losing youth hair turning gray much altered looks 
never thought death 
seemed monstrous 
rage providence like nothing known 
lose everything done reviewed past life defended like job summary self righteousness 
always done right far knew 
sins petty hardly deserve name sins 
remembered enjoyed seeing face looking glass liked pretty new dresses could make seem culpable 
remembered although never loved step mother observed except one occasion evelyn lost utmost respect deference first even willing love met slightest encouragement 
could honestly blame carefully concealed attitude disapproval towards ida said subtlety strange girl young merited cold hard self centred woman deserving love reality injurious father 
convinced mother lived half censorious yet wholly loving care might still preserved youth handsome boyishness health 
thought half absurd half tragic secret underlay life could honestly think much blame 
always thought bewilderment one might think dimly remembered vagary delirium 
sometimes seemed could true 
maria realized full self righteousness also honest 
saw need blame faults committed 
thought doctrine heard children wholly evil birth seem true 
could say wholly evil birth felt say tell lie god 
honestly could see fault father die 
suddenly mind gave leap standing point father 
suddenly reflected wholly grief loss considered father grief quitting world wherein dwelt long old loves life 
reflected upon possible fear unknown go 
maria love father mother strong element maternal 
thought father infinite pity one might think little child go long strange journey unknown place alone 
seemed awful thing god ask one like father die lingering death realize fully go alone 
remembered heard pulpit sundays somehow unknown seemed frightfully wide vast soul like father always like soul child find mother 
got comfort memory mother great strength 
seemed mother wherever would let father wander alone long 
would meet love chiding sometimes concert pitch love key note lead green pastures beside still waters psalmist 
maria moment got comfort memory masterliness mother known conception god towards soul reached true comprehended flower comprehends sun 
love god needs human trellis whereby creatures reach maria climbed towards trust reflection mother love strength spite love 
racking pity loss rage pity father almost roused fury rebellion swept away every consideration 
poor father poor father sobbed breath 
going die got mother take care anything 
try smile 
anything way mother could 
father want even act knew mother alive would tell would help 
maria thought poor solitary female thing traveling world alone never thought time marriage anything would ever marriage reality something cast outside pale possibilities made solitary still wept silently silently could awhile murmur agony sob escaped 
could help 
got little chair flung floor fairly writhed pain awful grief sense loss 
became deaf sound senses seemed failed 
alive sense grief primeval sense world grief existence necessity death loss 
felt little soft touch another little weeping human thing born like awful chances love grief flung beside 
maria locked doors forgotten window opened upper balcony easily accessible one climbing hall window 
evelyn listening door heard sobs 
knowing experience sister meant said climbed hall window scudded along little balcony maria window 
flung floor wept violently maria alarmed

memory kiss became pleasant seemed feel lily lips upon like living flower thrilled heart 
next morning took trolley car front house maria passing way school 
wading rather wearily yet still sturdily snow 
cleared night several inches drifted snow places although portions road bare swept broom winds 
maria tramping snow deep merely glanced george ramsey said good morning 
plenty time chosen express regrets seeing evening car yet reached 
said nothing except good morning george responded rather curtly raising hat stepping forward towards car 
felt unmistakable maria wished understand care particular acquaintance sting mother suggested evening must consider attentions significant would take much trouble repulse came 
boarded car late moving sluggishly snow

solace man receiving unmistakable rebuff received maria edgham 
conception girl plodding snow daily task 
dream saw instead snowy road long stretch dreary future brought rebuff 
quite merciless 
would yield moment regrets 
accepted stretch dreary future defiant acquiescence 
bowed pleasantly acquaintances met 
many morning road hardly passable places overcurved blue diamond crested snowlike cascades presenting ridges like graves 
half way school house maria saw village snow plough drawn struggling horse guided red faced man 
stood aside let pass 
man look 
frowned ahead task 
quite old man bent red youth brought forth cheeks frosty air 
everybody work way maria thought get happiness labor 
reflected soon man would lying stiff stark wintry snows summer heats nothing might trouble would matter 
reflected although younger presumably longer live time would inevitably come even unhappiness weighed morning would matter 
continued ineffectual track snow plough made certain pleasure exertion 
maria heights life mountain summits would agonize reach spiritual 
labor could never daunt 
always spirit finer essence would soar butterfly like toiling members 
beautiful morning trees heavily bent snow gave lustres like jewels 
air purity life 
maria inhaled frosty clear air regarded trees one might done taking stimulant 
kept mind upon would think george ramsey 
neared school house first child ran meet stumbling snow little jessy ramsey
