young members three four twenty think much dissolutions forget fancies constituents proud present calculate much future 
mr gresham 
father member barsetshire life looked forward similar prosperity though part inheritance failed take steps secured father seat 
autumn dissolution came frank gresham honorable lady wife de courcys back found mortally offended county 
great disgust another candidate brought forward fellow late colleague though manfully fought battle spent ten thousand pounds contest could recover position 
high tory great whig interest back never popular person england 
one trust though may willing place untrusted high positions 
case mr gresham 
many willing family considerations keep parliament one thought fit 
consequences bitter expensive contest ensued 
frank gresham twitted whig foreswore de courcy family ridiculed thrown tories foreswore father old friends 
two stools fell ground politician never rose feet 
never rose feet twice made violent efforts 
elections east barsetshire various causes came quick upon days eight twenty years age mr gresham three times contested county three times beaten 
speak truth spirit would satisfied loss first ten thousand pounds lady arabella made higher mettle 
married man fine place fine fortune nevertheless married commoner far derogated high birth 
felt husband rights member house lords least essential seat lower chamber 
would degrees sink nothing allowed sit mere wife mere country squire 
thus instigated mr gresham repeated useless contest three times repeated time serious cost 
lost money lady arabella lost temper things greshamsbury went means prosperously done days old squire

worried husband daily years parliament worried would furnish house portman square worried objected people every winter greshamsbury park house would hold changed tune worried selina coughed helena hectic poor sophy spine weak matilda appetite gone 
worrying causes pardonable said 
manner hardly pardonable 
selina cough certainly fairly attributable old fashioned furniture portman square would sophy spine materially benefited father seat parliament yet heard lady arabella discussing matters family conclave one would thought would expected results 
poor weak darlings carried london brighton brighton german baths german baths back torquay thence regarded four named bourne whence journey could made lady arabella directions

greshams time immemorial handsome 
broad browed blue eyed fair haired born dimples chins pleasant aristocratic dangerous curl upper lip equally express good humor scorn 
young frank every inch gresham darling father heart 
de courcys never plain 
much hauteur much pride may perhaps even fairly say much nobility gait manners even faces allow considered plain race nurtured venus apollo 
tall thin high cheek bones high foreheads large dignified cold eyes 
de courcy girls good hair also possessed easy manners powers talking managed pass world beauties till absorbed matrimonial market world large cared longer whether beauties 
misses gresham made de courcy mould account less dear mother

hitherto however followed suffered sisters suffered people greshamsbury attributed fact change made family medical practitioner 
came youngest flock whose birth said heralded loud joy came world four others pale temples wan worn cheeks skeleton white arms awaiting permission leave 
family year eldest son came age 
educated harrow still cambridge course day home 
coming age must delightful time young man born inherit broad acres wide wealth 
full mouthed congratulations warm prayers manhood welcomed gray haired seniors county affectionate motherly caresses neighbouring mothers seen grow cradle mothers daughters perhaps fair enough good enough sweet enough even soft spoken half bashful tender greetings girls perhaps first time call stern family name instructed instinct rather precept time come familiar charles familiar john must laid aside lucky dogs hints silver spoons poured ears young compeer slaps back bids live thousand years never die shouting tenantry good wishes old farmers come wring hand kisses gets farmers wives kisses gives farmers daughters things must make twenty first birthday pleasant enough young heir

case young frank gresham may supposed much nearer former latter yet ceremony coming age means like fate accorded father 
mr gresham embarrassed man though world know rate know deeply embarrassed heart throw open mansion receive county free hand though things going well 
nothing going well 
lady arabella would allow nothing near around well 
everything turned vexation longer joyous happy man people east barsetshire look gala doings grand scale young gresham came age 
gala doings certain extent 
july tables spread oaks tenants 
tables spread meat beer wine frank walked round shook guests hand expressed hope relations might long close mutually advantageous 
must say words place 
greshamsbury park fine old english gentleman seat assert easily past tense speaking reference past time 
spoken greshamsbury park park called mansion generally known greshamsbury house stand park 
may perhaps best describe saying village greshamsbury consisted one long straggling street mile length center turned sharp round one half street lay directly right angles 
angle stood greshamsbury house gardens grounds around filled space made 
entrance large gates end village gate guarded effigies two huge pagans clubs crest borne family entrance broad road quite straight running majestic avenue limes led house 
built richest perhaps rather say purest style tudor architecture much though greshamsbury less complete longleat less magnificent hatfield may sense said finest specimen tudor architecture country boast 
stands amid multitude trim gardens stone built terraces divided one another eyes attractive broad expanse lawn country houses generally surrounded gardens greshamsbury celebrated two centuries gresham would altered would considered destroyed one well known landmarks family 
greshamsbury park properly called spread far away side village 
opposite two great gates leading mansion two smaller gates one opening stables kennels farm yard deer park 
latter principal entrance demesne grand picturesque entrance 
avenue limes one side stretched house extended quarter mile appeared terminated abrupt rise ground 
entrance four savages four clubs two portal massive iron gates surmounted stone wall stood family arms supported two club bearers stone built lodges doric ivy covered columns surrounded circle four grim savages extent space high road ran abutted village spot sufficiently significant old family greatness 
examined closely might see arms scroll bearing gresham motto words repeated smaller letters savages 
gardez gresham chosen days motto choosing probably herald arms appropriate legend signifying peculiar attributes family 
however unfortunately men one mind exact idea signified 
declared much heraldic warmth address savages calling take care patron others inclined agree averred equal certainty advice people large especially inclined rebel aristocracy county beware gresham 
latter signification would betoken strength said holders doctrine former weakness 
greshams ever strong people never addicted false humility 
pretend decide question 
alas either construction equally unsuited family fortunes 
changes taken place england since greshams founded savage could longer way protect must protect like common folk live unprotected 
necessary neighbor shake shoes gresham frowned 
would wished present gresham could indifferent frowns neighbors 
old symbols remained may symbols long remain among us still lovely fit loved 
tell us true manly feelings times read aright explain fully truly written history englishmen become 
england yet commercial country sense epithet used let us still hope soon become 
might surely well called feudal england chivalrous england 
western civilised europe exist nation among high signors owners land true aristocracy aristocracy trusted best fittest rule nation english 
choose ten leading men great european people 
choose france austria sardinia prussia russia sweden denmark spain select ten england whose names best known leading statesmen result show country still exists closest attachment sincerest trust old feudal called landed interests

buying selling good necessary necessary may possibly good noblest work man let us hope may time esteemed noblest work englishman 
greshamsbury park large lay outside angle formed village street stretched away two sides without apparent limit boundaries visible village road house 
indeed ground side broken abrupt hills conical shaped oak covered excrescences seen peeping true extent park much magnified eye 
possible stranger get find difficulty getting known gates beauty landscape lover scenery would tempted thus lose 
said one side lay kennels give opportunity describing one especial episode long episode life existing squire 
represented county parliament ceased still felt ambition connected peculiar way county greatness still desired gresham greshamsbury something east barsetshire jackson grange baker mill hill bateson annesgrove 
friends respectable country gentlemen mr gresham greshamsbury even enough ambition aware longing 
therefore opportunity occurred took hunting county 
employment every way well suited unless matter finance 
though earliest manly years given great offence indifference family politics certain degree fostered ill feeling contesting county opposition wishes brother squires nevertheless bore loved popular name 
men regretted wished old squire found case could great among politician still willing great way county greatness suited 
known excellent horseman thorough sportsman one knowing dogs tender hearted sucking mother litter young foxes ridden county since fifteen fine voice view hallo knew every hound name could wind horn sufficient music hunting purposes moreover come property well known barsetshire clear income fourteen thousand year 
thus old worn master hounds run ground year mr gresham last contest county seemed parties pleasant rational arrangement hounds go greshamsbury 
pleasant indeed except lady arabella rational perhaps except squire 
time already considerably encumbered 
spent much done indeed wife two splendid years figured great among great ones earth 
fourteen thousand year ought enough allow member parliament young wife two three children live london keep country family mansion de courcys great people lady arabella chose live accustomed sister law countess lived lord de courcy much fourteen thousand year 
came three elections vast attendant cost costly expedients gentlemen forced recourse lived beyond income find impossible reduce establishments live much 
thus hounds came greshamsbury mr gresham already poor man 
lady arabella said much oppose coming lady arabella though could hardly said husband rule certainly entitled boast 
made first grand attack furniture portman square first time specially informed furniture matter much importance would future required move family residence london seasons 
sort conversations grew commencement may imagined 
lady arabella worried lord less might perhaps considered coolness folly encountering prodigious increase expense establishment spent much money pursuit wife enjoy might perhaps sparing rebukes indifference london pleasures 
hounds came greshamsbury lady arabella go london period year family expenses means lessened 
kennels however empty 
two years previous time story begins hounds carried seat richer sportsman 
felt mr gresham misfortune yet incurred 
master hounds ten years work rate done well 
popularity among neighbors lost politician regained sportsman would fain remained autocratic hunt possible 
remained much longer done last went away without signs sounds visible joy part lady arabella

fathers apt lenient sons uncles nephews cousins 
dr thorne still hoped reclaim black sheep thought head family showed unnecessary harshness putting obstacle way 
father warm support profligate son young medical aspirant warmer support profligate brother 
dr thorne junior rou perhaps young man sufficient abhorrence brother vices 
rate stuck manfully signified close henry company considered desirable ullathorne dr thomas thorne sent word squire circumstances visits would also cease 
prudent young galen elected establish barchester mainly expectation help ullathorne connexion would give 
however anger failed consider never known either early middle life consider anger points probably best worth consideration

man sort fit society dr fillgrave barchester 
must admitted 
yet found fit society old squire greshamsbury whose shoe ribbons dr fillgrave would objected tie high old squire stand county previous death 
spirit lady arabella known medical profession barsetshire good man died felt thorne short tenure greshamsbury favor already 
barsetshire regulars however doomed disappointment 
doctor already contrived endear heir though even much personal love lady arabella kept place great house unmoved nursery bedrooms also squire dining table 
must admitted quite enough make unpopular brethren feeling soon shown marked dignified manner 
dr fillgrave certainly respectable professional connexion county reputation maintain accustomed meet almost equal terms great medical baronets metropolis houses nobility dr fillgrave declined meet dr thorne consultation 
exceedingly regretted said exceedingly necessity felt never perform painful duty duty owed profession must perform 
every feeling respect lady sick guest greshamsbury mr gresham must decline attend conjunction dr thorne 
services could made available circumstances would go greshamsbury fast post horses could carry 
indeed war barsetshire 
dr thorne cranium one bump developed another combativeness 
doctor bully even pugnacious usual sense word disposition provoke fight propense love quarrelling would allow yield attack 
neither argument contest would ever allow wrong never least one behalf special hobbies ready meet world large 
therefore understood gauntlet thus thrown teeth dr fillgrave slow take 
addressed letter barsetshire conservative standard attacked dr fillgrave considerable acerbity 
dr fillgrave responded four lines saying mature consideration made mind notice remarks might made dr thorne public press 
greshamsbury doctor wrote another letter witty much severe last copied bristol exeter gloucester papers dr fillgrave found difficult maintain magnanimity reticence 
sometimes becoming enough man wrap dignified toga silence proclaim indifferent public attacks sort dignity difficult maintain 
well might man stung madness wasps endeavor sit chair without moving muscle endure patience without reply courtesies newspaper opponent

chapter xvii election important day election arrived men hearts beat quickly enough 
member british parliament question considerable moment man mind 
much often said great penalties ambitious pay enjoying honor tremendous expenses elections long tedious hours unpaid labor weary days passed house nevertheless prize one well worth price paid well worth price paid short wading dirt dishonor 
great european nation anything like offer ambition citizens great country europe even free popular constitution obtained us true sovereignty power rule 
man lays member parliament plays highest game highest stakes country affords 
men born silver spooned seat parliament comes matter course 
time early manhood hardly know sit honor hardly appreciated much matter course 
rule never know great thing parliament though reverse comes reverses occasionally come fully feel dreadful left 
men aspiring members fortunate fight battle without assurance success coming election must matter dread concern 
oh delightful hear long talked rival declined contest course clear find short canvass one majority safe pleasures crowing unlucky friendless foe quite secured gratification filled bosom mr moffat morning barchester election 
brought positive assurance success indefatigable agent mr nearthewinde 
admitted sides contest would close one mr nearthewinde would assert ought win unless things went wrong 
mr nearthewinde elections attend remaining courcy castle ever since coming miss dunstable barchester often possible mr moffat made greatly uneasy reflecting high bill would 
two parties outdone loudness assertions would side conduct election strict conformity law 
bribery 
bribery indeed days would dare bribe give absolute money absolute vote pay article downright palpable sovereigns 
purity much rampant means detection well understood 
purity carried much 
treating hiring two hundred voters act messengers twenty shillings day looking four hundred voters bands paid carriages furnished ribbons supplied 
british voters vote vote would love respect bore chosen candidate 
actuated would vote might stay away inducement would offered 
much said loudly loudly party nevertheless mr moffat early election days began misgivings bill 
proclaimed arrangement one exactly suitable taste mr moffat loved money 
man whose breast ambition great world joining aristocratic people continually war great cost tastes occasioned 
last election cheap triumph 
one way another money dragged purposes mind unintelligible middle first session much grumbling settled demands questioned whether whistle worth cost 
therefore great stickler purity election although considered matter known money passport elysium lived two years 
probably consider canvassing days immediately preceding election seen beer houses open half population drunk asked mr nearthewinde whether violation treaty taking place part opponent whether case would duly noticed view possible future petition 
mr nearthewinde assured triumphantly half least wallowing swine especial friends somewhat half publicans town eagerly engaged fighting mr moffat battle 
mr moffat groaned would expostulated mr nearthewinde willing hear 
gentleman services put requisition lord de courcy rather candidate 
candidate cared little 
pay bill would enough 
mr nearthewinde business well knew likely submit lectured mr moffat trumpery score expense 
certainly appear morning election though great change made resolution candidates pure 
early hour rough bands music heard every part usually quiet town carts gigs omnibuses flys old carriages inn yards every vehicle description could pressed service motion horses post boys paid candidates voters certainly liberal mode bringing poll 
election district city barchester extended miles side city omnibuses flys enough 
beer public houses almost without question chose ask rum brandy dispensed select circles within bars equal profusion 
ribbons mercers shops must emptied article far scarlet yellow concerned 
scarlet sir roger color friends mr moffat decked yellow 
seeing see mr moffat might well ask whether violation treaty purity time election question whether england go war energy whether would better save breath cool porridge meddle could helped foreign quarrels 
last view matter advocated sir roger motto course proclaimed merits domestic peace quiet

mr moffat said man wealth know lessons early youth love money increases gains strength success 
man mean spirit satisfied mere wealth

hence come adherence de courcys hence seat parliament hence also perhaps ill considered match miss gresham 
doubt privilege matrimony offers opportunities money loving young men ought lightly abused 
many young men marry without giving consideration matter whatever

many cases might spared men made adequate use opportunities youth youthful charms afford 
road wealth easy respectable matrimony course provided aspirant declines slow course honest work

shoulders certainly young seeing yet six twenty head ever old

without wit depth mental gift without honesty purpose industry good work two years sitting member barchester guest lord de courcy engaged eldest daughter one best commoners families england first began think miss dunstable sanguine election parliament secure
