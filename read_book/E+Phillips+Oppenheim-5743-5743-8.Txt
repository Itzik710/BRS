guest prompt announcement dinner dispelled might moments embarrassment oliver hilditch almost cordial greeting 
woman laid fingers upon guest coat sleeve 
trio crossed little hall almost silence 
dinner served small white georgian dining room every appurtenance almost sybaritic luxury 
light room thrown upon table two purple shaded electric lamps servants waited seemed pass backwards forwards like shadows mysterious twilight even faces three diners little pool light leaned forward 
dinner chosen taste restraint wines costly rare 
watchful butler attended trim parlor maid superintended service 
ordered bowl flowers removed table mistress address either 
conversation first amenities speedily became almost monologue 
one man talked whilst others listened man talked oliver hilditch 
possessed rare gift imparting color actuality phrases strange places spoke bringing thrill strange happenings shadowy room 
seemed scarcely country world visited country say men congregate admitted first city worshipper empty places possessed charm 
even sportsman confessed half apologetically reply question guest 
passed great rivers world without thought salmon driven forest lands across mountains behind giant locomotive without thought beasts might lurking waiting killed 
desire reach next place men women 
irrespective nationality francis queried 
absolutely 
never minded much race trick tongues rather strangely developed like feeling human beings around 
like smell sound atmosphere great city 
senses awake life becomes almost turgid veins dreary hours passing one place another

obvious places humanity presses thickest know others 
day talk 
francis although evening sheer lack sympathy refused admit shared extent hilditch passionate interest fellow creatures notwithstanding strange confusion thought thrown last twenty four hours felt something pungency life thrill new appealing surroundings sat high backed chair sipping wonderful wine eating almost mechanically set fascinated strange company 
three days cast occasional glances man seated criminal dock gaoler either side fine nervous features gaining added distinction sordidness surroundings 
garb civilisation seated amidst luxury obviously accustomed becoming light upon face strange fascinating flow words proceeding always lips man every external point view seemed amongst chosen ones world 
contrast amazing 
woman francis looked seldom curious sense mental disturbance poignant unanalysable 
amazing see opposite man told ghastly story mistress house appearance consort apparently engrossed polished conversation yet subtle withholding real self francis rather imagined felt somehow seemed imply fierce resentment husband entry arena life 
situation strange francis becoming subject influence inclined wonder whether met accident way court whether one heated nightmares following unconsciousness 
tell asked host one brief pauses conversation ever tried analyze interest human beings crowded cities hatred solitude empty spaces oliver hilditch smiled thoughtfully gazed salted almond balancing tips fingers

fell studying woman instead attempting banality pointless speech 
smooth gloss burnished hair daintiness low black brocaded shoes represented far physical outward self concerned absolute perfection 
ornament amiss line curve figure perfectly graceful 
yet even fire glow seemed dread brought flush color cheeks 
appearance complete lifelessness remained 
though sort crust formed condition physical perfection seemed render incomprehensible 
surprised see living husband told yesterday afternoon said calmly breaking last silence reigned 
admitted

still believe told must 
looked door raised head little though either listening adjudging time husband would return 
glanced across 
hatred said always drive away 
sometimes attracts 
sometimes person hates scarcely bear sight 
hate love somewhat alike
