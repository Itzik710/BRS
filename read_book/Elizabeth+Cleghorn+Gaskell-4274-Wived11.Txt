perhaps natural subject conversation two time would osborne long journey night never spoken place come whether north south east west squire choose allude anything might bring son wished conceal 
unexpressed idea minds mrs hamley present illness much aggravated entirely brought discovery osborne debts many inquiries answers head tabooed 
fact attempts easy conversation limited local subjects principally addressed molly roger 
intercourse productive pleasure even friendly feeling though thin outward surface politeness peace 
long day molly wished acceded father proposal gone home

mrs jones nurse assured time time mrs hamley never named name small services sickroom required since regular nurse 
osborne roger seemed molly felt much short conversations roger served give something think remainder solitary days 
osborne extremely polite even expressed gratitude attentions mother pleasant manner appeared unwilling show deeper feelings heart almost ashamed exhibition emotion night 
spoke agreeable young man speaks pleasant young lady molly almost resented 
squire seemed make account 
gave letters write small bills reckon could kissed hands thankfulness 
last afternoon stay hall came 
roger gone squire business 
molly went garden thinking last summer mrs hamley sofa used placed old cedar tree lawn warm air seemed scented roses sweetbrier 
trees leafless sweet odour keen frosty air looking house white sheets blinds shutting pale winter sky invalid room 
thought day father brought news second marriage thicket tangled dead weeds rime hoarfrost beautiful fine articulation branches boughs delicate twigs intertwined leafless distinctness sky 
could ever passionately unhappy goodness numbness made feel though life short troubled much anything death seemed reality 
neither energy heart walk far briskly turned back towards house 
afternoon sun shining brightly windows stirred unusual activity unknown cause housemaids opened shutters windows generally unused library 
middle window also door white painted wood went half way 
molly turned along little flag paved path led past library windows gate white railings front house went opened doors 
leave given choose books wished read take home sort half dawdling employment suited taste afternoon 
mounted ladder get particular shelf high dark corner room finding volume looked interesting sate step read part 
sate bonnet cloak osborne suddenly came

open door cold oh 
fresh pleasant 
began read sitting lowest step ladder write large old fashioned writing table close window 
minute two profound silence rapid scratching osborne pen upon paper sound 
came click gate roger stood open door 
face towards osborne sitting light back molly crouched corner 
held letter said hoarse breathlessness letter wife osborne 
went past post office thought osborne stood angry dismay upon face 
roger done see roger looked round molly stood corner red trembling miserable though guilty person 
roger entered room 
three seemed equally dismayed 
molly first speak came forwards said sorry wish hear help

try forget heard 
said osborne still ungraciously 
promise never speak one even roger try act speak never heard sure roger told give promise may rely upon 
yes promise said molly putting hand kind pledge 
osborne took rather action superfluous 
added think done even without promise 
perhaps better bind oneself 
go away 
wish never come room 
put book table softly turned leave room choking tears solitude chamber 
roger door holding open reading felt reading face 
held band firm grasp expressed sympathy regret occurred 
could hardly keep back sobs till reached bedroom 
feelings overwrought time past without finding natural vent action 
leaving hamley hall seemed sad troubled bear away secret ought never known knowledge brought uncomfortable responsibility 
would arise natural wonder osborne wife 
molly stayed long intimately hamley family without well aware manner future lady hamley planned 
squire instance partly order show osborne heir reach molly gibson doctor daughter early days knew molly well often alluded grand high wealthy marriage hamley hamley represented clever brilliant handsome son osborne might expected make 
mrs hamley unconsciously part showed projects constantly devising reception unknown daughter law 
drawing room must refurnished osborne marries osborne wife like west suite rooms perhaps trial live old couple must arrange feel little possible course mrs osborne comes must try give new carriage old one well enough us similar speeches given molly impression future mrs osborne beautiful grand young lady whose presence would make old hall stately formal mansion instead pleasant unceremonious home present 
osborne spoken languid criticism mrs gibson various country belles even home apt give airs home airs poetically fastidious mrs gibson socially fastidious unspeakably elegant beauty chosen wife satisfied yet satisfying marriage kept concealment parents length molly tore wanderings 
use could find might even try 
blank wall promise blocked way 
perhaps even right wonder endeavor remember slight speeches casual mentions name piece together something coherent 
molly dreaded seeing either brothers met dinner time nothing happened 
squire taciturn either melancholy displeasure 
never spoken osborne since return excepting commonest trifles intercourse could avoided wife state oppressed like heavy cloud coming light day 
osborne put indifferent manner father molly felt sure assumed conciliatory 
roger quiet steady natural talked others uneasy distress many accounts 
day principally addressed molly entering rather long narrations late discoveries natural history kept current talk without requiring much reply one molly expected osborne look something different usual conscious ashamed resentful even married exactly osborne morning handsome elegant languid manner look cordial brother polite towards secretly uneasy state things father 
would never guessed concealed romance lay perdu every day behavior 
always wished come direct contact love story found uncomfortable sense concealment uncertainty honest straightforward father quiet life hollingford even drawbacks board everybody knew everybody seemed secure pleasant comparison 
course felt great pain quitting hall mute farewell taken sleeping unconscious friend 
leaving mrs hamley different thing fortnight ago

existence seemed forgotten poor lady whose body appeared living long soul 
sent home carriage loaded true thanks every one family 
osborne ransacked houses flowers roger chosen books every kind

mamma said looking beyond molly stairs mrs gibson stood wrapped shawl shivering cold 
ran past molly mr gibson rather averted eyes first greeting mother child 
mrs gibson said grown darling look quite woman

went away hardly grown since except always hoped wisdom 
yes hope said mrs gibson rather meaning way 
indeed evidently hidden allusions seeming commonplace speeches 
came full light repose drawing room molly absorbed contemplation cynthia beauty 
perhaps features regular changes expressive countenance gave one time think 
smile perfect pouting charming play face mouth 
eyes beautifully shaped expression hardly seemed vary 
coloring unlike mother much red haired tints complexion long shaped serious gray eyes fringed dark lashes instead mother insipid flaxen ones 
molly fell love speak instant 
sate warming feet hands much ease life particularly attending mother time studying either dress measuring molly mr gibson grave observant looks guessing like 
hot breakfast ready dining room ready said mr gibson

little trouble conjecturing would enable stranger discover room 
cynthia captivated molly wanted devote new comer service 
ever since heard probability sister called sister whether scotch sister sister la mode de bretagne would puzzled people molly allowed fancy dwell much idea cynthia coming short time since met cynthia unconscious power fascination exercised upon 
people power 
course effects manifested susceptible 
school girl may found every school attracts influences others virtues beauty sweetness cleverness something neither described reasoned upon 
something alluded old lines love comely grace pleasing eye face constant heart may change turn ill thus true love may sever 
love know hast thou reason still dote upon ever 
woman charm men sex defined rather delicate mixture many gifts qualities impossible decide proportions 
perhaps incompatible high principle essence seems consist exquisite power adaptation varying people still various moods things men 
rate molly might soon aware cynthia remarkable unflinching morality glamour thrown would prevented molly attempt penetrating judging companion character even processes least accordance disposition 
cynthia beautiful well aware fact forgotten care one loveliness ever appeared little conscious 
molly would watch perpetually moved room free stately step wild animal forest moving almost continual sound music 
dress though ideas would considered ugly disfiguring suited complexion figure fashion subdued within due bounds exquisite taste 
inexpensive enough changes 
mrs gibson professed shocked find cynthia four gowns might stocked well brought many useful french patterns patiently awaited mother answer letter sent announcing return opportunity madame found 
molly hurt cynthia speeches thought implied pleasure mother felt seeing fortnight sooner two years absence inferior would received bundle silver paper patterns 
cynthia took apparent notice frequent recurrence small complaints 
indeed received much mother said kind complete indifference made mrs gibson hold rather awe much communicative molly child 
regard dress however cynthia soon showed mother daughter manner could use deft nimble fingers 
capital workwoman unlike molly excelled plain sewing notion dressmaking millinery could repeat fashions seen passing along streets boulogne one two pretty rapid movements hands turned twisted ribbons gauze mother furnished 
refurbished mrs gibson wardrobe sort contemptuous manner source molly could quite make 
day day course small frivolities broken upon news mr gibson brought mrs hamley nearer approach death 
molly often sitting cynthia surrounded ribbon wire net heard bulletins like toll funeral bell marriage feast 
father sympathized 
loss dear friend accustomed death seemed natural end things human 
molly death one known well loved much sad gloomy phenomenon 
loathed small vanities surrounded would wander frosty garden pace walk sheltered concealed evergreens

took notice outstretched hand chair offered 
sate little sofa one windows called molly 
look purchases said 
green ribbon fourteen pence yard silk three shillings went forcing speak trifles world attention throw away mother mother visitor 
mr preston took cue 
talked news day local gossip molly glanced time time almost alarmed bad expression suppressed anger almost amounting vindictiveness entirely marred handsome looks 
wish look tried rather back cynthia efforts maintaining separate conversation 
yet could help overhearing mrs gibson strain increased civility make cynthia rudeness possible deprecate anger 
talked perpetually though object detain whereas previous cynthia return allowed frequent pauses conversation though give opportunity take leave 
course conversation hamleys came 
mrs gibson never unwilling dwell upon molly intimacy county family latter caught sound name stepmother saying poor mrs hamley could hardly without molly quite looked upon daughter especially towards last afraid good deal anxiety

molly went back seat cynthia 
poor mrs hamley said softly 
cynthia took hand sympathy molly sad tender look rather understood passing mind quite understand 
death come time wonder dead knew passed upon earth left brilliant osborne failure roger success vanity human wishes thoughts suggested inextricably mingled mind 
came minutes 
mr preston saying unpleasant things could think hamleys tone false sympathy 
poor old squire wisest men woefully mismanaged estate 
osborne hamley fine gentleman understand means improve value land even capital 
man practical knowledge agriculture thousands ready money might bring rental eight thousand 
course osborne try marry one money family old well established object commercial descent though daresay squire young fellow man work 
family going fast pity old saxon houses vanish land kismet hamleys 
even senior wrangler roger hamley spent brains one effort 
never hear senior wrangler worth anything afterwards 
fellow college course livelihood rate

person cynthia appeared wholesomely afraid mr gibson 
present careful speaking showed deference mother 
evident respect mr gibson desire good opinion made curb manner earned good favor lively sensible girl much knowledge world made desirable companion molly 
indeed made something kind impression men 
first struck personal appearance pretty deprecating manner appealed much said wise foolish mercy folly 
way meant nothing really hardly conscious captivating 
even old williams gardener felt said confidante molly eh miss rare young lady pretty coaxing ways 
teach bud roses come season warrant ye learn sharp enough says bees stupid 
molly sweetest disposition world might become jealous allegiance laid cynthia feet never thought comparing amount admiration love received 
yet feel little cynthia poaching manor 
invitation quiet dinner sent osborne hamley declined 
thought right call soon afterwards 
first time molly seen family since left hall since mrs hamley death much wanted ask 
tried wait patiently till mrs gibson exhausted first gush infinite nothings molly came modest questions 
squire returned old habits health suffered putting inquiry light delicate touch dressing wound 
hesitated little little speaking roger one moment thought flitted across mind osborne might feel contrast brother college career painfully like referred remembered generous brotherly love always existed two entered upon subject cynthia obedience mother summons came room took work 
one could quieter hardly uttered word osborne seemed fall power 
longer gave undivided attention molly 
cut short answers questions without molly rightly understanding turned towards cynthia addressing 
molly saw look content mrs gibson face perhaps mortification heard wished know roger gave keener insight usual certain perceived mrs gibson would dislike marriage osborne cynthia considered present occasion auspicious beginning 
remembering secret let unwillingly molly watched behavior almost retained interests absent wife thinking much possibility attracting cynthia unknown mysterious mrs osborne hamley 
manner expressive great interest strong prepossession favor beautiful girl talking 
deep mourning showed slight figure delicate refined face 
nothing flirting far molly understood meaning word either looks words 
cynthia extremely quiet always much quieter men women part charm soft allurement passive 
talking france 
mrs gibson passed two three years girlhood cynthia late return boulogne made natural subject conversation 
molly thrown heart still unsatisfied details roger success stand last receive osborne good scarcely longer intimate farewell cynthia 
soon gone mrs gibson began praise 
well really begin faith long descent 
gentleman agreeable polite different forward mr preston continued looking little anxiously cynthia 
cynthia quite aware reply watched said coolly mr preston improve acquaintance 
time mamma think thought agreeable

clearer memory 
talking delightful mr osborne hamley 
molly always talking brother roger roger think seldom mentioned young man 
know mentioned mr roger hamley often said molly blushing little 
saw much home 
well well right dear 
daresay suits best 
really saw osborne hamley close cynthia help thinking perhaps better tell thinking 
much average appearance course suggests things 
perfectly understand thinking mamma said cynthia greatest composure molly doubt 
well harm sure 
hear say though like leave father alone present yet brother roger came back cambridge feel liberty quite much say ask dinner shall delighted come 
chickens much cheaper cook nice way boning forcemeat 
everything seems falling fortunately 
molly dear know forget 
roger hamley taken turn stopping home father ask one little quiet dinners 
molly slow taking minute sense reached brain went red hot especially saw cynthia watching light come mind great amusement 
afraid molly properly grateful mamma 
exert give dinner party account 
bestow kindness upon 
molly often puzzled cynthia speeches mother one occasions 
anxious say something much annoyed implication mrs gibson last words 
mr roger hamley good great deal home mr osborne hamley little reason spoke much one 
losing coherence difficulty finding words think 
oh cynthia instead laughing think might help explain instead cynthia gave diversion conversation 
mamma paragon gives idea weakness 
quite make whether body mind 
molly strong know accomplished clever 
every one says even papa generally praise young men 
made puzzle greater badly college 
character weak 
sure weakness somewhere agreeable 
must pleasant staying hall 
yes 
oh nonsense said mrs gibson wakening counting stitches pattern 
shall young men coming dinner pretty often see 
father likes shall always make point welcoming friends 
go mourning mother ever 
expect shall see great deal two families become intimate 
good hollingford people terribly behindhand say rather commonplace 
chapter xxi half sisters appeared mrs gibson predictions likely verified osborne hamley found way drawing room pretty frequently 
sure sometimes prophets help fulfilment prophecies mrs gibson passive 
molly altogether puzzled manners ways 
spoke occasional absences hall without exactly saying 
idea conduct married man imagined ought house servants pay rent taxes live wife 
mysterious wife might faded insignificance wonder 
london cambridge dover nay even france mentioned places different little journeys 
facts came quite casually almost unaware betraying sometimes dropped sentences ah would day crossing stormy indeed instead two hours nearly five 
met lord hollingford dover last week said c cold nothing london thursday thermometer degrees 
perhaps rapid flow conversation small revelations noticed one molly whose interest curiosity always hovering secret become possessed spite self reproach allowing thoughts dwell still kept mystery 
also evident osborne happy home 
lost slight touch cynicism affected expected wonders college one good result failure 
give trouble appreciating people performances rate conversation amply sprinkled critical pepper 
absent agreeable mrs gibson thought say 
looked ill health might consequence real depression spirits molly occasionally saw peeping pleasant surface talk 
referred happy days gone time mother alive talking directly voice sank gloom came countenance molly longed express deep sympathy 
often mention father molly thought could read manner something painful restraint noticed last hall still existed 
nearly knew family interior heard mrs hamley uncertain far father acquainted like question closely man questioned domestic affairs patients 
sometimes wondered dream short half hour library hamley hall learned fact seemed important osborne yet made little difference way life either speech action 
twelve fourteen hours remained hall afterwards allusion made marriage either roger 
indeed like dream 
probably molly would rendered much uncomfortable possession secret osborne struck particularly attentive devotion cynthia 
evidently amused attracted lively passionate kind manner 
admired beauty seemed feel charm would leave side come sit near molly anything reminded mother could talk alone 
yet came often gibsons mrs gibson might excused fancy taken head cynthia sake 
liked lounge friendliness company two intelligent girls beauty manners average one stood peculiar relation especially beloved mother whose memory cherished fondly 
knowing category bachelors perhaps indifferent people ignorance possible consequences 
somehow molly like first introduce roger name conversation lost many opportunity hearing intelligence 
osborne often languid absent followed lead talk awkward fellow paid particular attention second son roger pre eminent mrs gibson thoughts cynthia never seen freak take often speak 
come home since obtained high place mathematical lists molly knew knew working hard something supposed fellowship 
osborne tone speaking always every word every inflexion voice breathed affection respect nay even admiration nil admirari brother seldom carried exertions far 
ah roger said one day 
molly caught name instant though heard gone 
fellow thousand thousand indeed believe match anywhere goodness real solid power combined 
molly said cynthia mr osborne hamley gone sort man roger hamley one tell much believe brother praises one subject osborne hamley becomes enthusiastic 
noticed twice 
molly hesitated point large round begin description mrs gibson struck shows sweet disposition osborne hamley praise brother 
daresay senior wrangler much good may deny conversation heavy heavy 
great awkward fellow boot looks know two two made four mathematical genius 
would hardly believe osborne hamley brother see think profile 
think molly said persevering cynthia 
like said molly 
kind 
know handsome like osborne 
rather difficult say quietly molly managed quite aware cynthia would rest till extracted kind opinion 
suppose come home easter said cynthia shall see 
great pity mourning prevent going easter charity ball said mrs gibson plaintively 
like take two girls partners 
put awkward position 
wish could join towers party 
would secure partners always bring number dancing men might dance done duty ladies house 
really everything changed since dear lady cumnor invalid perhaps go 
easter ball great subject conversation mrs gibson 
sometimes spoke first appearance society bride though visiting twice week winter long 
shifted ground said felt much interest would responsibility introducing mr gibson daughter public notice though fact pretty nearly every one going ball seen two young ladies though ball dresses 
aping manners aristocracy far knew intended bring molly cynthia occasion regarded something light presentation court 
yet favorite excuse either invited house wish go invited without 
even made difficulty miss browning old friend gibson family came one morning ask two girls come friendly tea round game afterwards mild piece gaiety designed attention three mrs goodenough grandchildren two young ladies school boy brother staying visit grandmamma 
kind miss browning see hardly like let go know till easter ball 
till invisible said cynthia always ready mockery exaggerate pretension mother high rank sovereign must give us sanction play round game house 
cynthia enjoyed idea full grown size stately gait contrasted meek half fledged girl nursery miss browning half puzzled half affronted 
understand 
days girls went wherever pleased people ask without farce bursting new fine clothes public place 
mean gentry took daughters york matlock bath give taste gay society growing quality went london young ladies presented queen charlotte went birthday ball perhaps
