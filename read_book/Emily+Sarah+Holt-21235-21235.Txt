mrs phoebe dear remember saying madam died mrs rhoda tell ten years sorry phoebe smiled affirmative 
well sorry either rate 
light come back thine eyes dear child peace said old mrs dorothy 
ah folks always know hardest give 
phoebe looking startled eyes saw mrs dorothy guessed secret 
went fire fresh water kettle 
face calm usual returned 
softly said mon sort n est pas plaindre il est desirer je n ai plus rien craindre car dieu est mon berger 
end
