political position utterly perverse

gens pompeii named sixty years consular lists means acquired full standing eyes aristocracy even father pompeius occupied invidious equivocal position towards senate ranks cinnans recollections suppressed perhaps forgotten 
prominent position pompeius acquired sulla set inward variance aristocracy quite much brought outward connection

even age would clearly defined respectable position contented general senate outset destined 
content fell fatal plight wishing something else could 
constantly aspiring special position state offered could make mind occupy deeply indignant persons laws bend unconditionally yet everywhere bore mere affectation modesty one many peers trembled mere thought undertaking anything unconstitutional 
thus constantly fundamental variance yet time obedient servant oligarchy constantly tormented ambition frightened aims much agitated life passed joylessly away perpetual inward contradiction

concessions take place came much pressure democracy attempts mediation moderate aristocracy 
two laws single still surviving leader section gaius cotta carried consulate concerned tribunals set aside next year second abolished sullan enactment held tribunate disqualified undertaking magistracies allowed limitations continue merely like every half measure excited displeasure parties 
party conservatives friendly reform lost notable head early death cotta occurring soon dwindled away crushed extremes becoming daily marked 
party government wretched remiss necessarily retained advantage presence equally wretched equally remiss opposition 
quarrel government general pompeius state matters favourable government altered differences became distinctly developed subsisted partisans whose hopes aspired higher objects seat honor senate aristocratic villa 
first rank stood gnaeus pompeius 
doubtless sullan already shown little home among party lineage past history hopes separated withal nobility whose protector champion officially regarded 
breach already apparent widened irreparably spanish campaigns general 
reluctance semi compulsion government associated colleague true representative quintus metellus turn accused senate probably without ground careless malicious neglect spanish armies brought defeats placed fortunes expedition jeopardy 
returned victor open secret foes head army inured war wholly devoted desiring assignments land soldiers triumph consulship 
latter demands came collision law 
pompeius although several times invested extraordinary way supreme official authority yet administered ordinary magistracy even quaestorship still member senate none one passed round lesser ordinary magistracies could become consul none one invested ordinary supreme power could triumph 
senate legally entitled became candidate consulship bid begin quaestorship requested triumph remind great scipio like circumstances renounced triumph conquered spain 
pompeius less dependent constitutionally good senate respected lands promised soldiers 
although senate feebleness even animosity conceivable yield points concede victorious general return executioner service democratic chiefs triumph consulate assignations land honorable annihilation senatorial indolence among long series peaceful senatorial imperators favourable lot oligarchy able hold readiness general thirty six 
heart really longed command mithradatic war could never expect obtain voluntary bestowal senate well understood interest oligarchy could permit add africa european trophies third continent laurels plucked copiously easily east reserved events pure aristocracy 
celebrated general find account ruling oligarchy remained neither time ripe temperament pompeius fitted purely personal outspoken dynastic policy alternative save make common cause democratic party 
interest bound sullan constitution could pursue personal objects quite well better one democratic 
hand found needed democratic party 
active adroit leaders ready able relieve resourceless somewhat wooden hero trouble political leadership yet much insignificant able even wishful dispute celebrated general first place especially supreme military control 
even gaius caesar far important simply young man whose daring exploits fashionable debts far fiery democratic eloquence gained name could feel greatly honored world renowned imperator allowed political adjutant 
popularity men like pompeius pretensions greater abilities usually attach value willing confess could fall highest measure lot young general whose accession gave victory almost forlorn cause democracy 
reward victory claimed soldiers would follow 
general seemed oligarchy overthrown amidst total want considerable chiefs opposition would depend solely pompeius determine future position 
much could hardly doubt accession general army returned victorious spain still stood compact unbroken italy party opposition must consequence fall existing order things 
government opposition equally powerless soon latter longer fought merely weapons declamation sword victorious general ready back demands government would case overcome perhaps even without struggle 
coalition military chiefs democracy pompeius democrats thus found urged coalition 
personal dislikings probably wanting either side possible victorious general could love street orators could hail pleasure chief executioner carbo brutus political necessity outweighed least moment moral scruples 
democrats pompeius however sole parties league 
marcus crassus similar situation pompeius 
although sullan like latter politics quite case pompeius preeminently personal kind means ruling oligarchy italy head large victorious army suppressed rising slaves 
choose whether would ally oligarchy coalition enter coalition chose latter doubtless safer course 
colossal wealth influence clubs capital case valuable ally prevailing circumstances incalculable gain army senate could met troops pompeius joined attacking force 
democrats moreover probably somewhat uneasy alliance powerful general displeased see counterpoise perhaps future rival associated person marcus crassus 
thus summer first coalition took place democracy one hand two sullan generals gnaeus pompeius marcus crassus 
generals adopted party program democracy promised immediately return consulship coming year pompeius also triumph desired allotments land soldiers crassus conqueror spartacus least honor solemn entrance capital 
two italian armies great capitalists democracy thus came forward league overthrow sullan constitution senate nothing oppose save perhaps second spanish army quintus metellus pius 
sulla truly predicted would done second time metellus means inclined involve civil war discharged soldiers immediately crossing alps 
nothing left oligarchy submit inevitable 
senate granted dispensations requisite consulship triumph pompeius crassus without opposition elected consuls armies pretext awaiting triumph encamped city 
pompeius thereupon even entering office gave public formal adherence democratic program assembly people held tribune marcus lollius palicanus 
change constitution thus principle decided 
establishing tribunician power went work earnest set aside sullan institutions 
first tribunician magistracy regained earlier authority 
pompeius consul introduced law gave back tribunes people time honored prerogatives particular initiative legislation singular gift indeed hand man done one living wrest community ancient privileges 
new arrangement jurymen respect position jurymen regulation sulla roll senators serve list jurymen doubt abolished means led simple restoration gracchan equestrian courts 
future enacted new aurelian law colleges jurymen consist one third senators two thirds men equestrian census latter half must rilled office district presidents called tribuni aerarii 
last innovation farther concession made democrats inasmuch according least third part criminal jurymen indirectly derived elections tribes 
reason senate totally excluded courts probably sought partly relations crassus senate partly accession senatorial middle party coalition doubtless connected circumstance law brought praetor lucius cotta brother lately deceased leader 
renewal asiatic revenue farming less important abolition arrangements taxation established asia sulla presumably likewise fell year 
governor asia time lucius lucullus directed reestablish system farming revenue introduced gaius gracchus thus important source money power restored great capitalists 
renewal censorship lastly censorship revived 
elections new consuls fixed shortly entering office fell evident mockery senate two consuls gnaeus lentulus clodianus lucius gellius removed senate commands account wretched management war spartacus 
may readily conceived men put motion means important grave office placed command purpose homage new holders power annoying senate 
least eighth part senate sixty four senators number hitherto unparalleled deleted roll including gaius antonius formerly impeached without success gaius caesar publius lentulus sura consul presumably also obnoxious creatures sulla 
new constitution thus reverted main arrangements subsisted sullan restoration 
multitude capital fed state chest words provinces tribunician authority gave every demagogue legal license overturn arrangements state moneyed nobility farmers revenue possessed judicial control governors raised heads alongside government powerfully ever senate trembled verdict jurymen equestrian order censorial censure 
system sulla based monopoly power nobility political annihilation mercantile aristocracy demagogism thus completely overthrown 
leaving view subordinate enactments abolition overtaken till afterwards restoration right self completion priestly colleges nothing general ordinances sulla survived except one hand concessions found necessary make opposition recognition roman franchise italians hand enactments without marked partisan tendency therefore even judicious democrats found fault among others restriction freedmen regulation functional spheres magistrates material alterations criminal law 
coalition agreed regarding questions principle respect personal questions political revolution raised 
might expected democrats content general recognition program demanded restoration sense revival commemoration dead punishment murderers recall proscribed exile removal political disqualification lay children restoration estates confiscated sulla indemnification expense heirs assistants dictator 
certainly logical consequences ensued pure victory democracy victory coalition far 
democracy gave name program officers joined movement pompeius gave power completion could never yield consent reaction would shaken existing state things foundations would ultimately turned men still lively recollection men whose blood pompeius shed crassus laid foundation enormous fortune 
natural therefore time significant weakness democracy coalition took slightest step towards procuring democrats revenge even rehabilitation 
supplementary collection purchase money still outstanding confiscated estates bought auction even remitted purchasers sulla censor lentulus provided special law hardly regarded exception though sullans thereby severely affected personal interests yet measure essentially confirmation confiscations undertaken sulla 
impending miliatry dictatorship pompeius work sulla thus destroyed future order things question raised rather decided destruction 
coalition kept together solely common object setting aside work restoration dissolved formally rate reality object attained question quarter preponderance power first instance fall seemed approaching equally speedy violent solution

reason existed longer still dissolution armies postponed 
turn taken matters looked one two generals allied democracy would seize military dictatorship place oligarchs democrats chains

first crassus played subordinate part coalition obliged propose owed even election consulship mainly proud intercession pompeius 
far stronger pompeius evidently master situation availed seemed could become instinct multitude even designated absolute ruler mightiest state civilized world 
already whole mass servile crowded around future monarch 
already weaker opponents seeking last resource new coalition crassus full old recent jealousy towards younger rival thoroughly outstripped made approaches senate attempted unprecedented largesses attach multitude capital oligarchy crassus helped break ever ungrateful multitude would able afford protection whatever veterans spanish army 
moment seemed armies pompeius crassus would come blows gates capital 
retirement pompeius democrats averted catastrophe sagacity pliancy 
party well senate crassus important pompeius seize dictatorship truer discernment weakness character powerful opponent leaders tried method conciliation 
pompeius lacked condition grasping crown except first proper kingly courage 
already described man effort loyal republican master rome vacillation indecision pliancy concealed boasting independent resolution 
first great trial destiny subjected failed stand 
pretext pompeius refused dismiss army distrusted crassus therefore could take initiative disbanding soldiers 
democrats induced crassus make gracious advances matter offer hand peace colleague eyes public private besought latter double merit vanquished enemy reconciled parties would add third yet greater service preserving internal peace country banishing fearful spectre civil war threatened 
whatever could tell vain unskilful vacillating man flattering arts diplomacy theatrical apparatus patriotic enthusiasm put motion obtain desired result main point things well timed compliance crassus assumed shape pompeius alternative either come forward openly tyrant rome retire 
length yielded consented disband troops 
command mithradatic war doubtless hoped obtain allowed chosen consul could desire since lucullus seemed practically ended war campaign 
deemed beneath dignity accept consular province assigned senate accordance sempronian law crassus followed example 
accordingly pompeius discharging soldiers resigned consulship last day retired time wholly public affairs declared wished thenceforth live life quiet leisure simple citizen 
taken position obliged grasp crown seeing willing part left empty one candidate throne resigning pretensions 
senate equites populares retirement man things stood first place belonged political stage reproduced first instance nearly position parties found gracchan marian epochs 
sulla merely strengthened senatorial government created bulwarks erected sulla fallen government nevertheless remained primarily senate although doubt constitution governed main restored gracchan constitution pervaded spirit hostile oligarchy 
democracy effected establishment gracchan constitution without new gracchus body without head neither pompeius crassus could permanently head clear made still clearer recent events 
democratic opposition want leader could directly taken helm content time hampering annoying government every step 
oligarchy however democracy rose new consideration capitalist party recent crisis made common cause latter oligarchs zealously endeavored draw side acquire counterpoise democracy 
thus courted sides moneyed lords neglect turn advantageous position profit one former privileges yet regained fourteen benches reserved equestrian order theater restored decree people

oligarchy saw political military dictatorship certain ruin pompeius since coalition hated foe overwhelming blow democratic party also could little comfort prospect 
however desirable putting end government senate could took place way far less victory party personal victory powerful ally 
latter might easily arise far dangerous opponent democratic party senate 
danger fortunately avoided years disbanding spanish army retirement pompeius would recur increased measure pompeius placed head armies east 
overthrow senatorial rule new power pompeius occasion however pompeius acted least allowed others act behalf 
two projects law introduced one besides decreeing discharge long since demanded democracy soldiers asiatic army served term decreed recall commander chief lucius lucullus supplying place one consuls current year gaius piso manius glabrio second revived extended plan proposed seven years senate clearing seas pirates

burgesses invest private man pleasure merely extraordinary authority supreme magistracy also sphere office definitely settled 
senate choose man ranks consulars mitigation form selection left simply really choice presence vehemently excited multitude senate could entrust chief command seas coasts save pompeius alone

even primitive fundamental principle state law roman republic mentioned highest military civil authority could conferred without co operation burgesses infringed favor new commander chief 
inasmuch law conferred beforehand twenty five adjutants nominate praetorian rank praetorian prerogatives highest office republican rome became subordinate newly created office left future find fitting name reality even involved monarchy 
total revolution existing order things foundation laid project law 
pompeius gabinian laws measures man given striking proofs vacillation weakness surprise us decisive energy 
nevertheless fact pompeius acted occasion resolutely consulate capable explanation 
point issue come forward monarch prepare way monarchy military exceptional measure revolutionary nature could still accomplished forms existing constitution first instance carried pompeius far way towards old object wishes command mithradates tigranes 
important reasons expediency also might urged emancipation military power senate 
pompeius could forgotten plan designed exactly similar principles suppression piracy years failed mismanagement senate issue spanish war placed extreme jeopardy neglect armies part senate injudicious conduct finances could fail see feelings great majority aristocracy regarded renegade sullan fate store allowed sent general government usual powers east 
natural therefore indicate position independent senate first condition undertaking command burgesses readily agree 
moreover high degree probable pompeius occasion urged rapid action around may presumed little indignant retirement two years 
projects law regarding recall lucullus expedition pirates introduced tribune people aulus gabinius man ruined finances morals dexterous negotiator bold orator brave soldier

parties relation gabinian laws democracy discontented leaders might secret could well come publicly forward project law

course left democrats still even adhere alliance pompeius hollow embrace present opportunity least definitely overthrowing senate passing opposition government leaving ulterior issue future well known weakness pompeius character 
accordingly leaders praetor lucius quinctius seven years exerted restoration tribunician power former quaestor gaius caesar supported gabinian proposals 
privileged classes furious merely nobility also mercantile aristocracy felt exclusive rights endangered thorough state revolution recognized true patron senate 
tribune gabinius introduction proposals appeared senate house fathers city almost point strangling hands without considering zeal extremely disadvantageous method arguing must ultimately proved 
tribune escaped forum summoned multitude storm senate house right time sitting terminated 
consul piso champion oligarchy accidentally fell hands multitude would certainly become victim popular fury gabinius come order certain success might endangered unseasonable acts violence liberated consul 
meanwhile exasperation multitude remained undiminished constantly found fresh nourishment high prices grain numerous rumors less absurd circulation lucius lucullus invested money entrusted carrying war interest rome attempted aid make praetor quinctius withdraw cause people senate intended prepare second romulus called pompeius fate first reports like character 
vote thereupon day voting arrived 
multitude stood densely packed forum buildings whence rostra could seen covered roofs men 
colleagues gabinius promised veto senate presence surging masses silent except single lucius trebellius sworn senate rather die yield 
latter exercised veto gabinius immediately interrupted voting projects law proposed assembled people deal refractory colleague octavius formerly dealt proposition tiberius gracchus namely depose immediately office 
vote taken reading voting tablets began first seventeen tribes came read declared proposal next affirmative vote would give majority trebellius forgetting oath pusillanimously withdrew veto 
vain tribune otho endeavored procure least collegiate principle might preserved two generals elected instead one vain aged quintus catulus respected man senate exerted last energies secure lieutenant generals nominated commander chief chosen people 
otho could even procure hearing amidst noise multitude well calculated complaisance gabinius procured hearing catulus respectful silence multitude listened old man words none less thrown away 
proposals merely converted law clauses unaltered supplementary requests detail made pompeius instantaneously completely agreed

occurrence clearly showed disorganized machinery roman constitution whenthe power legislation placed respected initiative inthe hands demagogue however insignificant respected final determination hands incapable multitude time extended important questions administration 
manilian proposal acceptable none political parties yet scarcely anywhere encountered serious resistance
