length dreary old woman seemed grow gaunt ghostly every day took form lane disordered fancy misfortune war put upon 
lane dreamed gray winter afternoon dark lowering clouds hung drab colored hills chill north wind scurried bare meadows sending dead leaves rustling heath moaning leafless oaks 
sad day thought faced biting wind sad life fitting one deed determined long since left city country road 
ascended steep hill 
highest point looked back toward city leaving forever 
faint lay distance white spires shining dimly purple haze 
dark shadow far winding road discerned object moving slowly hill 
closer looked trembled 
old woman flowing black robes laboriously climbing hill 
whirling placed hand breast firmly grasped something strode onward 
soon glanced shoulder 
yes came hobbling crest bent form long crooked staff clearly silhouetted gray background 
raised long staff pointed 
seemed day waning deep shadows lay valleys night already enveloped forest 
rents broken clouds pale stars twinkled fitfully 
soon dark cloud curtains scurried across spaces shutting light 
plunged forest 
footsteps made sound soft moss glided wooded aisles giant trees 
well deep woods turned look behind 
saw shadow blacker forest gloom stealthily slipping tree tree 
looked 
hours traveled never stopping never looking backward never listening intent placing great distance pursuer 
came upon swamp feet sank soft earth night tireless strength fateful resolve toiled dreamy waste woods waters length huge black rock loomed way 
ascended summit looked beyond 
seemed reached destination 
wood spirits phantoms night would mourn would keep secret 
peered across shining lake tried pierce gloom 
living thing moved vision 
silver rippling waves shimmered starlit sky tall weird pines waved gently night breeze slender cedars resembling spectres reared heads toward blue black vault heaven 
listened intently 
faint rustling leaves left upon oaks 
strange voices always haunted murmuring river waters whispering maidens muttering women clear 
suddenly two white forms came gliding across waters 
face one young girl 
golden hair clustered round face fair brow 
lips smiled mournful sweetness 
form seemed instinct life 
face living breathing girl soulful passionate arms outstretched eyes shining strange hopeful light 
fell sank chill depths falling slowly falling softly 
cool waters passed floated misty shadowy space 
infinitude silence enclosed 
dim sullen roar waters came ears borne faintly stronger breeze earth 
anguish despair tinged sodden wind 
weird terrible came cry 
steaming boiling burning rumbling chaos fearful rushing sullen water flash light like falling star sped dark clouds

chapter xxv lane returning restless wandering woods 
neared flooded river thought heard shout help 
hurried bank looked around saw living thing 
brought sharply cry unmistakable scream human distress 
seemed come behind boathouse 
running far round building water would permit peered river directions 
first saw half submerged float sunken hull launch fast running river across wide expanse muddy water outline levee 
suddenly spied river piece driftwood man clinging 
help help came faintly water 
lane glanced quickly 
several boats pulled shore one evidently used boatman collecting driftwood morning contained oars long pike pole 
boat long wide beam flat bottom sharp bow blunt stern craft experienced rivermen used heavy work 
without moment hesitation lane shoved water sprang aboard 
meanwhile short though time log human freight disappeared beyond open space willows 
although lane pulled powerful stroke got slack water current swift boat sheered abruptly went stream sweep 
marking piece driftwood aided swiftly running stream lane soon overhauled 
log man appeared clutching square piece timber probably beam bridge long full spikes 
near enough lane saw fellow holding helpless fast spikes 
head arms water 
lane steered boat alongside shouted man 
made outcry movement lane shipping oars reached grasped collar 
steadying overturn boat lane pulled half way gunwale second effort dragged boat 
man evidently fainted last outcry 
body slipped seat flopped bottom boat lay white face fully exposed glare sun 
broad scar doubly sinister pallid face disfigured brow 
lane recoiled well remembered features richard swann 
god almighty cried 
caustic laughter rolled whirling waters 
boat disengaged driftwood floated swiftly river 
lane stared bewilderment swann pale features 
amazement brought strangely face face man made deaf increasing roar waters blind greater momentum boat 
heavy thump grating sound splintering wood followed lurch boat splashing cold water face brought lane back realization situation 
looked white face unconscious man 
boat turned round 
saw huge stone poked ugly nose water 
turned face stream 
sea irregular waves twisting currents dark dangerous rocks patches swirling foam met gaze 
lane stood boatman instinct see water far ahead spectacle thrilled 
yellow flood changeful yet consistent action rolled whirled wide incline stony banks lost mile smoky veil mist 
visions past scenes whipped mind saw ocean careening frothing golden moon tide sweeping curdled sand grim stream silt rushing sullen sweep doom wildfire prairie leaping cavorting reaching turning shooting irresistibly borne lash wind 
saw current live thing freeing terror 
roar like blending thousand storms among pines filled ears muffled sense hearing appalled 
sat cheeks blanching skin tightening heart sinking roar heard death 
escape impossible 
end always expected hand 
meet alone 
man ruined sister many others must go render accounting justice fate lane felt wretched gratification 
boat glanced hard grind rock shot long yellow incline great curling wave whirled back lane heavy shock sent flying seat gurgling demoniacal roar deafened ears cold eager flood engulfed 
drawn whirlpool sucks feather tossed wind throws straw 
boat bobbed upright near 
grasped gunwale held 
bounced buffeting waves rode long swells like cork careened brink falls glided thumped hidden stones floating logs sped black nosed rocks drifted fogs yellow mist ran piles driftwood trembled shock beating waves twisted swirling current 
still lane held vise like clutch 
suddenly seemed feel mighty propelling force rose high stern boat 
bow pitched yawning hole 
long instant boat slid glancing fall thunderous roar furious contending wrestle cold yellow flying spray icy immersing enveloping blackness giant tore hands boat 
whirled round round sank 
languid softness stole 
saw smile mother schoolmate boyhood old attic played rainy days spotted cows pasture running brook 
saw tall young man favorite winning way life bright 
terrible blows heart hammered ribs throbs mighty pain burst brain great constrictions throat choked 
began fighting encompassing waters frenzied strength 
fought way see last light gasp air 
flood sucked weight pulled feet

boat half full water swarm ghastly face protruded 
dint great effort lane pulled sideways ledge turned water 
swann lay limp sodden 
eyes would appeared dead shone conscious light terror passionate appeal hope look man prayed life 
presently lips moved imperceptibly 
save god sake save shuddering emotion shock electricity shook lane 
ears rang sullen hollow reverberating boom flood 
man done harm begging saved 
swann poor wretch afraid die feared unknown terror seething turmoil waters could face end cold ride 
fool lane cried glaring wildly 
another dream unreality swayed 
heard roar saw splitting white crested waves clouds yellow vapor 
beat numb legs shook like savage dog 
made discovery way could account oars remained boat 
loose oar locks 
questions formed lane mind questions seemed put dawning significance 
heard cry help found boat drowning man proved one two men earth hated one two men wanted kill drifted rapids come safely vortex death swann lips formed prayer oars remained boat far choppy sea waves saw bridge 
old familiar resting place 
white enveloping glow seemed see standing bridge 
came strange revelation 
yesterday stood bridge seeing blair last time 
stood lived hour keenest anguish come agony watched plunging river 
watched eyes could never forget 
mind exquisitely alive sensibility plexus racked broken nerves taken every line every channel stone rapid flood engraved ineffaceable characters 
unintelligible vagary thought breast seemed crushed heart broken imagined adrift surging river planned escape rapids

great trial without hesitation shoved boat ledge 
round round back eddy floated 
outlet stream side gleaming line foam marked escape water rushing current whirled boat stern ahead 
shot plunge rise 
racing uneven swells felt hissing spray malignant tips waves broke fury boat expended shower stinging drops 
wind cut face 
rode sea foam turgid rolling mounds water heaved long planes laughed hollow boom channels smooth current torrent wreathed black stones yellowish white 
lane saw golden sun blue sky fleecy clouds red purple colored hills felt chest expand mounting glory great effort 
muscles back arms strengthened long toil heavy axe rippled swelled burned stretched like rubber cords strung tight like steel bands 
boat toy 
rodes waves threaded labyrinth ugly stones shot unobstructed channel evaded menacing drift 
current carried irresistibly onward 
keen eye caught danger ahead sunk oars deep pulled back 
powerful stroke made boat pause another turned bow right left swift water hitting obliquely sheered safe direction

descent quickened 
borne increasing velocity 
yellow demons rose fury 
boo oom boo oom old river god voiced remorseless roar 
shrill screaming shriek splitting water sharp stones cut boom 
yellow mist might smoke hell streaked boat upon curving billow upon upheaving curl frothy water
