thus duelling may considered necessary evil arising wickedness crime rare occurrence prevents others equal magnitude occurring every day world reformed nothing prevent 
men ever governed estimation world whole world decide duelling become usage offer cheek upon first smitten till practice discontinued 
man refuses fight duel stigmatised coward company shunned unless wretch without feeling life becomes burden
