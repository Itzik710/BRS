whole night fires seen burning horizon direction carthage light stretched like giant torches across motionless lake 
one army could tell festival celebrated 
following day barbarian passed region covered cultivation 
domains patricians succeeded one another along border route channels water flowed woods palm long green lines olive trees rose colored vapors floated gorges hills blue mountains reared behind 
warm wind blowing 
chameleons crawling broad leaves cactus 
barbarians slackened speed 
marched isolated detachments lagged behind one another long intervals 
ate grapes along margin vines 
lay grass gazed stupefaction upon large artificially twisted horns oxen sheep clothed skins protect wool furrows crossing one another form lozenges ploughshares like ships anchors pomegranate trees watered silphium 
wealth soil inventions wisdom dazzled 
evening stretched tents without unfolding thought regret hamilcar feast fell asleep faces towards stars

sometimes would interrupt utter hoarse cry depths throat matho mule would quicken pace others would hasten spendius would begin though still torn agony 
subsided last evening fourth day 
marching side side right army side hill stretched plain lost vapors night 
lines soldiers also defiling making undulations shade 
time time passed eminences lit moon stars would tremble points pikes helmets would glimmer instant would disappear others would come continually 
startled flocks bleated distance something infinite sweetness seemed sink upon earth 
spendius head thrown back eyes half closed inhaled freshness wind great sighs spread arms moving fingers might better feel cares streamed body 
hopes vengeance came back transported 
pressed hand upon mouth check sobs half swooning intoxication let go halter dromedary proceeding long regular steps 
matho relapsed former melancholy legs hung ground grass made continuous rustling beat cothurni 
journey however spread without ever coming end 
extremity plain would always reach round shaped plateau would descend valley mountains seemed block horizon would proportion approached glide positions 
time time river would appear amid verdure tamarisks lose turning hills 
sometimes huge rock would tower aloft like prow vessel pedestal vanished colossus 
regular intervals met little quadrangular temples served stations pilgrims repaired sicca 
closed like tombs 
libyans struck great blows upon doors opened 
one inside responded 
cultivation became rare 
suddenly entered upon belts sand bristling thorny thickets 
flocks sheep browsing among stones woman blue fleece waist watching 
fled screaming saw soldiers pikes among rocks 
marching kind large passage bordered two chains reddish colored hillocks nostrils greeted nauseous odour thought could see something extraordinary top carob tree lion head reared leaves 
ran thither 
lion four limbs fastened cross like criminal 
huge muzzle fell upon breast two fore paws half hidden beneath abundance mane spread wide like wings bird 
ribs stood severally beneath distended skin hind legs nailed raised somewhat black blood flowing hair collected stalactites end tail hung perfectly straight along cross 
soldiers made merry around called consul roman citizen threw pebbles eyes drive away gnats 
hundred paces saw two suddenly appeared long file crosses bearing lions 
long dead nothing left wood remains skeletons others half eaten away jaws twisted horrible grimaces enormous ones shafts crosses bent beneath swayed wind bands crows wheeled ceaselessly air heads 
thus carthaginian peasants avenged captured wild beast hoped terrify others example 
barbarians ceased laughter long lost amazement 
people thought amuses crucifying lions besides especially men north vaguely uneasy troubled already sick 
tore hands darts aloes great mosquitoes buzzed ears dysentry breaking army 
weary yet seeing sicca 
afraid losing reaching desert country sands terrors 
many even unwilling advance

gorge stretched meadow thinly sown shrubs barbarians devoured buds 
afterwards found field beans everything disappeared though cloud grasshoppers passed way 
three hours later reached second plateau bordered belt green hills 
among undulations hillocks silvery sheaves shone intervals one another barbarians dazzled sun could perceive confusedly great black masses supporting rose though expanding 
lances towers elephants terribly armed 
besides spears breasts bodkin tusks brass plates covered sides daggers fastened knee caps extremity tusks leathern bracelet handle broad cutlass inserted set simultaneously back part plain advancing sides parallel lines 
barbarians frozen nameless terror

elephants entered mass men spurs breasts divided lances tusks upturned like ploughshares cut hewed hacked scythes trunks towers full phalaricas looked like volcanoes march nothing could distinguished large heap whereon human flesh pieces brass blood made white spots gray sheets red fuses 
horrible animals dug black furrows passed midst 
fiercest driven numidian crowned diadem plumes 
hurled javelins frightful quickness giving intervals long shrill whistle 
great beasts docile dogs kept eye carnage 
circle narrowed degrees weakened barbarians offered resistance elephants soon center plain 
lacked space thronged half rearing together tusks clashed one another 
suddenly narr havas quieted wheeling round trotted back hills 
two syntagmata however taken refuge right bend ground thrown away arms kneeling faces towards punic tents imploring mercy uplifted arms 
legs hands tied stretched ground beside one another elephants brought back
