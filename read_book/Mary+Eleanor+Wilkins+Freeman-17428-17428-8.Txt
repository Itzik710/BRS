chapter ix one sunday evening four months cherry party barnabas thayer came house strolled slowly across road 
paused leaned pasture bars looked around 
nobody sight road either direction everything still except vibrating calls hidden insects come flood tide life early autumn 
barnabas listened calls certain element mystery things reach one sense 
humble way voices unseen listened seemed take rhythmic cadence 
presently drone multifold vibrations sounded ears even rise fall like mighty breathing nature 
sun low sky full violet clouds 
barney could see outlined faintly gray sweep roof covered charlotte daily life 
soon bell evening meeting began ring barney started 
people might soon appear way meeting want see 
barney avoided everybody nowhere since cherry party even meeting 
led life hermit seldom met kind except store went buy simple materials solitary meals 
barney turned aside main road old untravelled one leading past sylvia crane house 
appeared scarcely lane old wheel ruts hidden green weedy ridges bordering stone walls looked like long green barrows overgrown poison ivy vines rank shrubs 
long way house except sylvia crane one cellar house stood barney could remember 
old blackened chimney bricks still step stone worn dead forgotten feet old lilac bushes grown front windows 
two poplar trees stood front yard met road casting long shadows like men 
sylvia crane house beyond barney passed furtive anxious glance charlotte aunt lived 
saw nobody windows guardian stone quite rolled away door sylvia home 
barney walked little way beyond sat stone wall remained motionless 
heard meeting bell farther away ceased 
wind quite crisp cool smote back northwest 
could smell wild grapes pungent odor decaying leaves 
autumn beginning thoughts raised like ghost ashes summer stole vague vision winter 
saw second driving slant snow storm old drifting road saw white slant sylvia house roof 
time curious pleasant desire might primitive coeval provident passion squirrels honey bees thrilled 
dismissed bitterly 
need winter stores provisions sweet home comfort hearts freezing storms care whether laid stores hearth wood garden produce apples miserable solitude inborn desire northern races approach sterile winters containing desires insure fulfilment elements human pleasure failed suddenly move remembered human life one sense 
illustration remained motionless opposite across road old orchard tree full apples 
low sun struck showed spheres rosy orange brilliant atalanta apples gold background dark violet clouds 
barney looked tree glorified time almost common meaning tree might looked gorgeous procession passing mind engrossed misery seeming project eyes like veil 
presently grew dusky glowing apples faded town clock struck eight 
barney counted strokes arose went slowly back 
gone far saw distance road man woman strolling slowly towards 
disappeared suddenly thought turned lane opened upon road 
thought concern might sister rebecca something woman gait suggested william berry 
knew william allowed mother house rebecca met outside

sylvia speak heard moan closed door seemed heard went road although knew could 
quite dark light came pale wild sky 
moon young feebly intermittent clouds 
barney hastening along trembling unnerved 
tried persuade woman left ill laboring sudden aberration mind yet spite realized terrible rationality 
little among village people late little heard village gossip knew story richard alger desertion sylvia crane 
like richard alger desertion charlotte barnard sylvia little fault taking one twin brothers might closer likeness characters features perhaps repetition sins deformities might one able see question came charlotte like sylvia charlotte even sitting watching awful eagerness comes hunger heart seen one woman wounded heart like men disposed generalize think seen wounded hearts women 
reached turn road come main one house charlotte lived stood still looking direction

suddenly cruel repulsion seizes mankind towards reptiles unsought love seized barney 
unclasped clinging hands fairly pushed away 
good night rose said shortly turned went path door determined strides 
barney rose called paid attention 
even ran path door shut turned back 
trembling head foot great rushing ears heard quick light step behind got road hurried vague dread

curious shrinking look fled clothes muslin skirts light bar ge shawl green bonnet seemed slant away eyes two women watching 
pembroke woman leaned close cousin ear whispered sharp hiss breath 
cousin started colored red matronly face neck 
stared furtive shamed air poor rebecca hastening house 
door closed quick slam 
always rebecca years beyond transgression admitted ostensibly old standing village odor disgrace isolation still clung shaken every motion folds garments 
came nostrils wherever went like miserable emanation personality 
always shrank back lest others noticed always would 
particularly shunned strangers 
sight strange woman clothed utter respectability strictest virtue intimidated beyond power self control always wondered told realized old disgrace assumed new mind hideous freshness 
door slammed behind rebecca two women drove home guest presently feasted company fare supper strange tragedies histories listened less savor memory fine green tea sweet cake tongue 
hostess mind longer pressed plum cake hot biscuits honey cousin lieu gossip entertainment 
stories old except found new listener never vital interest 
simply made imagination twang pleasantly could hardly stir old vibrations

village girl younger generation married great demand preparation bridal outfit finest needle work 
would go day day house bride elect sew early morning late night upon elaborate quilts dainty linen fine new wedding gowns 
bore always steady cheerfulness nobody dreamed preparing others happiness lost trial 
nobody dreamed every stitch set wedding garments took painfully piece heart envy 
faithful needle sewed seemed keep old wounds open like harrow never shrank 
saw sweet foolish smiles blushes happy girls whose wits half astray dazzle love felt half tremble hands fitted bridal gowns white shoulders touch lovers 
walked met like doppelg ngers wearing self old joy face looked unswervingly 
harder look likeness one joy one old sorrow one dearer 
charlotte task whereby earned shillings consoling strengthening poor forsaken jilted girls instead arraying brides would happier easier one 
sat sewing fine even stitches light evening candle hearing soft murmur voices best rooms fond couples sat smiling like soldier work 
pinned bridal veils flowers nobody knew face instead bride seemed smile mockingly veil 
much happier although would sternly denied watching sick putting wonderful needle work shrouds request also 
except increase staidness dignity certain decorous change garments charlotte barnard seem grow old 
girlish bloom never faded sober bonnet although ten years gone since marriage broken 
barney used watch furtively charlotte going past 
knew quite well helping girl get ready married 
saw going home swift shadowy figure dark poor shillings pocket 
go work filled fierce resentment 
childish masculine disregard except bare actualities could see need could let help 
knew cephas barnard income meager charlotte needed little earnings barest necessaries could let give barney laying money 
made whereby left everything charlotte children married 
worked hard 
summer tilled great farm winter cut wood 
winter tenth year quarrel charlotte severe one full snow storms fierce winds bitterly cold 
winter long swamps frozen men could get cut wood 
barney went day day cut wood great swamp mile behind house 
stood morning night hewing trees gotten lusty growth graves kind 
roots sunken deep among twined bones fathers helped make rich frozen soil great swamp 
crusty snow three feet deep tall blackberry vines hooped snow set fast either end like snares hard work making one way 
snow heads dried weeds blow away autumn stayed stalks persistency life outlives death sturdy bushes almost trees swamp pinks wild roses waxed gigantic lost outlines stretched farther loads snow 
barney hewed wood midst white tangle trees bushes vines like wild dumb multitude death things pressing ever trying crowd away 
hit passed swung back face semblance life 
squirrel chattered leaped white boughs started dead thing come life seemed like voice motion death rather life 
half mile away right wood cutters work 
wind right way could hear strokes axes shout 
often worked alone swinging axe steadily breath white cloud face amused miserably one might bitter sweetmeat old dreams 
dreams present belonged past dreamed one sings old songs 
sometimes seemed quite possible still belonged life might still come true 
would hear hoarse shout still air side swamp would know suddenly charlotte would never wait home yonder worked welcome home night 
wood cutters families 
pass lot way open road 
barney would either retreat farther among snowy thickets else work fury could seem see filed past 
often go home noon ate nothing morn night

goin work doors weather nobody know got wife eight children got nobody 
man cast defiant eyes great store windows dim thick blue sheaves frost 
day like barney seemed hewing asunder sturdy fibers oak hemlock terrible sinews frost winter many tree seemed rear threatening stiffly like old man death 
fierce contest could keep alive certain delight working swamp awful arctic days 
sense could still fight conquer something simple destructive force nature aroused new self respect 
snow storms barney plunged forth swamp worked day thick white slant storm snow heaping upon bowed shoulders 
people prophesied would kill kept day day even cold february 
came south rain thaw barney went swamp worked two days knee deep melting snow 
morning awoke bed sharp knives lay alone day night next day night able stir without making knives cut vitals 
barney lay time soul became fairly bound passiveness awful fetters fiery bone muscle sometimes groaned nobody heard 
last night felt whole physical nature knitting stifling awful coils pain 
tears rolled cheeks 
prayed hoarse gasps could tell anybody heard

one contingency never occurred barney helpless clinging charlotte 
never dreamed people might talk disparagingly consequence 
partly isolated life partly natural bent curious innocence ignorance conception human estimates conduct 
vantage points many people indeed many cases seemed hold identical ones chosen child first observed anything 
overheard word expostulation never interpreted rightly 
thought people considered wrong charlotte much weary treated badly

thought never stand upright 
went always mental vision bent like grandfather face inclined ever downward towards miserable future 
still sat william gotten morning bowed pitifully chair times strange look eyes watched charlotte moving seemed somehow give lie bent back 
often charlotte would start met look think involuntarily quite straight would come old vision shock see sitting 
last came day minister one deacons church called asked see charlotte privately 
barney looked startled quite white 
sat quite long many coercive glances deacon minister latter finally arisen made request trembling embarrassed voice 
charlotte led unfinished front parlor boarded windows 
barney heard open front door give light air 
sat still waited breathing hard 
terrible dread curiosity came 
seemed soul overreached body room 
without overhearing word suddenly knowledge quite foreign imagination seemed come 
presently heard front door shut charlotte came alone 
pale sweet exalted look eyes met barney gone asked hoarsely

waited fifteen minutes eyes upon clock

got hat peg hung weeks went house yard 
sister rebecca moving feebly road little baby arms 
taking first walk spring sunshine 
nurse gone away week 
face clear pale 
sweet color gone eyes radiant held head old way 
new love lifting old memories 
stared wonderingly baby little downy head brother 
barney said loud 
stood still road staring parted lips 
baby wailed softly hushed mechanically great happy startled eyes fixed upon brother 
barnabas went hill charlotte barnard spring advancing 
trees full green nebula life comes blossom 
little wings bearing birds songs cut air 
bluebird shone glistening fence rail like jewel turned hand 
across fields red oxen moving plough ridges green grass springing air full strange fragrance fragrance since strikes thoughts comes spring alone odor thrown growing motion life resurrection 
barney thayer went slowly hill curious gait strange gestures angel wrestling casting strong motions wings 
fought way step step
