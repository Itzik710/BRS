chapter ii 
sir george 
sun hot hour two middle day even shadow dwelt cold breath winter death something humanity felt unfriendly 
gibbie however bare legged bare footed almost bare bodied sun shadow made small difference except one musical intervals life make melody existence 
bare feet knew difference flags heart recognized unconsciously secret meaning symbol change one almost happy dull bright day 
hardy hardship knew nothing better constant good humored sparring nature circumstance privilege enjoyed came thoroughly never mourned like animals peace 
bliss animals lies lower level shadow bliss moment earth look pine live holy carelessness eternal 
gibbie means belonged higher order yet indeed much better blessed little animal 
city show 
knew many people thought small things better would chosen one else know 
knew peripatetic vendors bakers small grocers tradespeople 
animal laying great stock time would something time reflection whenever might come 
chiefly experience wonderful provision future perception character knew nicety one large acquaintance would behave circumstances within scope experience 
little vagabond rises scale creation carries street amount material serving knowledge human nature human need human aims human relations business life hardly another possess 
even poet greatly wise virtue sympathy scarcely understand given human condition well man whose vital tentacles contact years 
gibbie looking shop window turning one heel take sweep oftenest seen trotting 
seldom walked 
gentle trot one natural modes 
though day trot sunshine nevertheless sun going wee gibbie upon trot chilling darkening streets 
much eat 
near penny loaf 
half cookie stormy child thrown away ease temper done perhaps better service easing gibbie hunger 
green grocer woman entrance court father lived good way street found lost earring given small yellow turnip gibbie nearly welcome apple 
fishwife finstone creel back given hands could hold sea weed called dulse presumably sweetness although good eating 
added gift small crab carried seashore set free alive 
half cookie turnip dulse smell baker bread 
rather one meager days 
wonderful upon little rare natures capable making things live thrive 
great deal got things generally got whether thing chapter bible yellow turnip marvel use material often show least result strength character 
superstitious priest ridden catholic may kingdom heaven high beyond sight one counts broadest english churchmen 
truly gibbie got fat food got far better 
carried hardly say along rags muscle small hard healthy knotting like whipcord 
degrees health poverty well riches gibbie health splendid 
senses also marvellously acute 
already hinted gift finding things 
eyes sharp quick roving went near ground little fellow 
success however considerations could well account regarded born special luck finding 
doubt sufficient weight given fact even turning mind strayed direction whence object cast reflected rays retina rays never failed reach mind also 
one occasion picked pocket book gentleman dropped mingled fun delight trying put owner pocket unseen collared testimony young woman coming behind seen whole would handed police 
remained doubt thing seemed incredible 
give penny however gibbie spent upon loaf 
notions honesty knew nothing always could restore things found habit came quite another cause 
clue owner carried thing found father generally let lie length nature convertible turned drink 
gibbie thus lived streets like townsparrow like human bird without storehouse barn boy could well human father would day sitting certain dark court hard work aching head bloodless system would afford 
said court narrowest part long poverty stricken street bearing name evil omen called widdiehill place gallows 
entered low archway middle old house around yet clung musty fame departed grandeur ancient note 
court wing house rose outside stair leading first floor stair rickety wooden shed shed sat father gibbie cobbled boots shoes long time year light lasted 
stair two inside house went lodging slept garret 
got bed george galbraith never knew invariably drunk 
morning however always found generally aching head always mingled disgust desire drink 
day alas disgust departed desire remained strengthened approach evening 
day worked might main might main worked life procure means death 
one ever sought treat one would accept drink 
man inborn honesty usurping demon vile thirst even yet age forty able cast 
last little glory cloud origin trailing behind yet trailed 
doubtless needs time make drunkard thief yet even longing highest would stolen forgotten glass whisky still often spite sickness aches innumerable george labored might wherewith make drunk honestly 
strange honesty wee gibbie child well gave almost little trouble gibbie caused hard hearted seen child want would drunkest shared whisky fancied cold would put last garment upon whisky dimmed eyes child scarcely seemed want anything thought never entered mind gibbie always looked smiling contented father little make 
time low opinion deservings justly consciousness dwindled little live thirst 
well neither men praise shamefully neglected child one respect important one well neighbors gave best work made lowest charges 
way much good 
yet would rather drunken cobbler many fair professor bunyan calls 
grasping merchant ranks infinitely lower drunken cobbler 
thank god son man judge plead cause yea worse right 
may well drunkards social outcasts intercession made excuse pleaded alas poor wretches would storm kingdom peace inspiration enemy 
let us try understand george galbraith 
existence sense sunless dreary cold winded desert evermore confronted resolves betterment knowledge first eager mouthful strange element rosy dawn would begin flush sky mist green cover arid waste wind song ripple air length misery day would vanish utterly night throb dreams 
george nature common man 
heart poet weak enough capable endless delight 
time read good book dreamed noble dreams 
even yet stuff dreams made fluttered particoloured rags life color color even scarecrow 
good mother father man character intellectually socially 
true terrible bouts drinking time perfectly sober 
given son fair education george part trotted curriculum elphinstone college altogether without distinction 
beyond father entirely neglected future even revealing fact indeed dimly aware wilful oversight part design others property entirely slipped possession 
father yet alive george married daughter small laird neighbouring county woman education great natural refinement 
took home ancient family house city occupied garret whose outer stair cobbled shoes 
father life lived peace tolerable comfort though poor enough way 
even wife could make ends meet would relations grievously offended marriage afford smallest assistance 
even husband slippery incline long lived managed keep within bounds called respectability 
died however soon gibbie born george began lose altogether 
next year father died creditors appeared claimed everything 
mortgaged land houses upon sold george left without penny means winning livelihood already lost reputation might introduced employment 
heavy work altogether unfit bottle companion merry hard drinking shoemaker would died starvation sunk beggary 
man taught trade george glad enough work deaden stings conscience memory procure means deadening still 
even something way improvement hitherto applied nothing one dreamful natures capable busy exertion time ready collapse disgust every kind effort 
gibbie got thus far alive puzzle creature could solved 
must charity ministration one humble woman one claimed particular interest except mrs croale tender 
sad sight eyes see roving streets infinitely sadder sight father even bent work hands arms knees going salvation 
thoughts might visiting poor worn brain tell looked pale picture misery 
best restore service nearly shapeless boots carter beggar fast losing idea making consumed heart soul hellish thirst 
thirst drunkard even soul body 
poor fellow sat drinking companions mistress croale parlor seldom flash broke reverie seemed sunk show region fancy spirit wandered lighten dulness would unfrequently invade forecourt hell 
even damned must times become aware surely terrible though momentary hush must fall upon forsaken region 
yet drinking companions would missed george galbraith silent poorly responsive wit humor rest always courteous always ready share never looking beyond present tumbler altogether genial kindly honest nature 
sometimes two three happened meet elsewhere would fall wondering silent man sought company seeing contributed little hilarity evening seemed derive little enjoyment 
believe company necessary well drink enable elude conscience feast imagination 
knew also fought misery investments bonds also beelzebub would cast beelzebub therefore felt home chapter iii 
mistress croale 
house met yet little character remaining 
mistress croale come derived worthiness memory yet lingering place worthy aunt deceased always encouraged vague idea obligation live 
hence made rule supply drink long customers kept decent long quarrel aloud put danger visit police tell tales offended modesty utter oaths peculiarly atrocious quality defame sabbath day kirk bible 
terms long paid might get drunk pleased without smallest offence mistress croale 
least unquestionable infringement rules occurred would pounce upon shameless one sudden sharp reproof 
doubt cherished hope recommending making deposits view coming balance sheet 
result life far claims respectability gathered clientele douce well disposed drunkards rarely gave trouble long house though sometimes reason anxious fate individuals left 
another peculiarity government would rarely give drink woman 
na na would say wuman dee wi strong drink lat men dee like canna help 
made exception behalf personal friends way sipping sipping privately account trouble said meant complaint speaking generally known although nature nobody idea 
truth like customers also going hill justifying every step descent 
lately way going regularly church go occasionally yet always took yearly sacrament result seemed abounded finding justifications excuses 
probably stirring conscience made necessary peace 
lord appear person amongst us much would sight sinners day sure many like mistress croale would go 
bad woman slowly surely growing worse

day went went short autumnal brightness quenched chilly fog

opened door shop like thief glided softly dim parlor candles yet lit 
light enough however busy little fire grate show clean sanded floor crossed flickering shadows colored prints cases stuffed birds walls full rigged barque suspended center ceiling chief shows heaven earth black bottle table tumblers holding ladle wine glass turned bottom upwards 
must omit part without rest could whole kettle water sat hob softly crooning 
compared place george work day indeed earthly paradise 
presence appearance mistress croale insignificant element paradisial character place 
clean white cap blue ribbons 
hair neatly divided drawn back forehead 
every trace dirt untidiness disappeared person one importance size bearing 
wore gown dark stuff bright flowers black silk apron 
face composed almost sadness throughout evening waited person upon customers comported dignity slow step stately carriage seemed rather belong assistant religious ceremony one ministered orgies drunken tradespeople

george whole soul bent upon drink obeyed twice mother 
time finished toilet usual company assembled appeared amongst respectability clean shirt purity besides general adhesiveness trade material would yield single ablution long delayed 
welcomed nod grin merry word individual fashion sat measuring whisky pounding slow dissolving sugar tasting mixture critical soul seated tongue palate 
conversation time dull strong tendency censorious 
circle claims respectability silently admitted conduct man acquaintance public note pronounced upon understood reference claims smile incredulity pity headshake regretful condemnatory time best reduce condition word conduct could longer meaning reference 
hostess addressed galbraith sir george accepted title certain unassuming dignity 
universally known city known best lawyers baronet direct derivation hand king james sixth 
fire burned cheerfully kettle making many journeys table things gradually grew lively 
stories told often without point therefore without effect reminiscences sorely pulpy broken edges offered accepted laughter sober ears might detected strangely alien sound adventures related truth necessary element reception 
case postman instance dismissed losing bag letters week one present believed word said yet happened endowed small stock genuine humor stories regarded much favor authentic 
revival scarcely reached sir george 
said little nothing slow gulps toddy sat looking vacantly glass 
true smiled absently others laughed manners 
doubtless seeing somewhere saddest visions things might 
wretched craving lower organs stilled something spared brain believe chief joy drink gave lay power feel gentleman 
washed hands shaven face clean shirt something doubt necromantic whisky far 
faded ghosts ancestral dignity worth story evil potion called mind sir george hung ready fall last last mildewed fruit tree galbraith ah one ancestors lived conscience thought come would transmitted poor sir george horrible addition moral weakness physical proclivity grown hideous craving

chapter v gibbie calling 
sure father neglect whole better gibbie would kindness father persistently embodying 
picture sir george help whisky mild hatching oven mistress croale parlor softly breaking shell cobbler floating mild gentleman air lukewarm imagination poor wee gibbie trotting outside frosty dark autumn night moon keeps staring vague disconsolate hardly therefore less pathetic 
window parlor light revel shone radiant red curtain would stand listening moment darting yards suddenly swiftly like scared bird fall steady trot lane till reached window would stand listen 
whether made departure return twenty hundred times night one else could told 
sometimes would change extend trot along widdiehill sometimes along parallel vennel never far jink lane glowing window 
never moth haunted lamp persistently 
ever ran pavement soft sounding soles bare feet smile boy face grew sleepy still smiled still trotted still paused window still started afresh 
much pitied reader may think 
never life yet pitied 
thought hardship wrong occurred 
would difficult impossible believe get idea head existence bore shape ought 
things always whence take fresh start question beginning authority interfered decree gibbie scour midnight streets pass repass far shining splendor red indeed would bitter though inarticulate complaint burst bosom 
evil power issue command gibbie peace invaded 
late streets empty neither carriage cart wheelbarrow truck went bumping clattering stones 
well lighted gas bordering houses dark 
single foot farer passed loud hollow sounding boots along pavement two girls would come laughing along merriment echoing rude wide stillness 
cold wind small forsaken solitary wind moist thin fog seemed well wee gibbie roaming night met various corners directions 
nothing nowhere go like gibbie business whose life even upon mightiest hope whose conscious awake 
expected ever desired discover listening window simply whether yet signs company breaking conclusions point never mistaken arrived would hard say 
seldom heard voice father still seldomer anything beyond tone 
night however time drew near must go lest sabbath broken mistress croale decent house gibbie stood tiptoe head level windowsill heard father utter two words daurside came window voice loved plain distinct 
words conveyed nothing mere hearing made memorable 
time however forgot indications best known perceived company point separating moment take eyes door heard first sounds opening 
however always hard gibbie stand still especially hard midnight cold feet threatened grow indistinguishable slabs pavement driven order lose sight practice art already cultivated crab like perfection running first backwards forwards scarcely superior speed 
long ere much expected sound mistress croale voice heralded hour patience blossom possession 
voice neither loud harsh clear firm noise followed loud strident 
voices part movement chairs feet sudden contact different portions body walls tables larger 
guests obeying voice hostess one like flock sheep poor shepherd work turn fold midnight 
gibbie bounded stood still statue door cheek heard mistress croale hand upon lock bolted trembling eagerness entry court houses nearer widdiehill 
one one pitiable company issued paradise stumbled away far gone leave taking 
passed gibbie stood took heed father always last least capable 
often left door never close behind eyes mistress croale seen gibbie dart like imp court take charge weary way home hover like guardian angel less one truth around unstable equilibrium father tall swaying form 
thereupon commenced series marvellous gymnastics part wee gibbie 
imagine small boy gigantic top six times size keeps erect peg whipping round running round unfailingly applying spot moment precise measure impact necessary counterbalance perpetual tendency fall one direction another two air single invention invention one might meet ancient clock contrived men time mingle play earnest mind eye real likeness sir george attended midnight week son gilbert 
home big one staggered reeled gyrated tumbled round round went little one behind side feet never touching ground dancing like prize fighter little arms hands well forward like flying buttresses 
indeed buttresses flew flew universally leaning tower 
propped propped wonderful judgment skill graduation force applied perfect success 
last year half time wee gibbie nightly guide sir george homeward steps self disabled mass fallen prostrate gutter snore night 
first special difficulty turning corner jink lane widdiehill successfully overcome twain went reeling revolving along street much like whirlwind half forgotten laws gyration length spun court foot outside stair baronet workshop

whether uncertain response janet tone merely truth loud heard save thrill chord spirit one end indeed twisted around earthly peg looped tail piece far unknown tell may name recurring brought mind last words poor sambo anyhow janet looked saw tears rolling child face

jesus alone knows father reveal 
janet studied jesus man knows friend infinitely better knew friend lord god

one morning found reaching manse minister unwell consequence miss machar could attend ginevra turned therefore walk home 
manse upon another root glashgar nearer glashruach nicie home many time went came lift longing eyes ridge hid view 
morning ginevra observed every moment nicie looking side mountain saw something unusual upon occasionally indeed winding road turned backs stopping turning round gaze 
matter nicie asked 
looking erin mother deein answered nicie 
exclaimed ginny turning stared mountain expecting perceive nicie mother somewhere upon face 
na na missie ye canna see said girl sicht

nobody wants either shall get home one misses us 
nicie glad enough consent turned hill began climbing 
nicie know part nearly well lay glashruach cottage climbed distance often stopping turning look valley prospect streams river kept still widening changing ascended arrived place path grew doubtful could tell two directions ought go 
take way take nicie said ginevra find path way come back find path way come back mine 
childish proposal one nicie consented little child 
advancing short distance doubt path appearing quite plainly sat expecting little mistress return directly 
thought anxiety crossed mind one broad sunlight mountain side first summer long day sitting peace nicie fell maidenly reverie nicie sat long time half dreaming great light without really thinking anything 
came latent fear exploded heart yes could become little mistress jumped feet shouted missie missie galbraith ginny answer came back 
mountain still midnight 
ran spot parted along path plainer idly forgetting 
hurried wildly calling ran 
mean time ginevra found path indubitable imagining led straight door nicie mother cottage nicie would moment thinking also bit fun set dancing running fast time nicie came good mile 
delight thus alone upon grand mountain earth banished far great rocky heap climbing leading climbing towards sky ginny way thinking much god 
little taught concerning nothing almost pleasant meditate upon nothing could hide heart dreadfully glad lay alone little bed listening sound burn ran window 
soul large wilderness ready voice come crying prepare way king 
path mere sheep track led length lonely hollow hill side swampy peat bog bottom 
stopped 
place looked unpleasant reminding always felt came unexpectedly upon angus mac pholp 
would go alone would wait till nicie overtook 
must places people possessed devils miss machar always made read word demons ran thought thus lone hearted bird uttered single wailing cry strange ear 
cry remained solitary unanswered first suddenly felt nobody feeling pang uneasiness 
brave child nothing frightened much except father turned went slowly back edge hollow nicie must time visible 
haste anxiety however nicie struck another sheep track higher hill ginny could see living thing nearer valley far comfort desolation began invade saw upon road distant seemed motionless cart man drawn white horse 
never life felt alone 
often felt lonely always known find bodily presence somebody 
might cry scream whole day nobody answer heart swelled throat sank away leaving wide hollow 
eerie nicie would soon come would well 
sat stone could see path come long way back 
never never nicie appear 
last began cry 
process ginny slow one never brought much relief 
tears would mount eyes remain little pools baca long time crying went 
time pools would grow deeper swell larger last become two huge little lakes larger slowness gathering two mighty tears would tumble edges embankments roll white mournful cheeks 
time many followed eyes fast becoming fountains verse heard sunday church seemed come head call upon time trouble answer thee 
must mean ask god help saying prayers good hear anybody good 
god good people become rest lost mountains better try could much harm 
even would hear would surely angry calling upon trouble 
thinking began pray dim distorted reflection god mind 
alone pray real god maker heart prays know son jesus 
prayers heard accordance idea god seem pray miserably would infinite wants met every honest cry even sent deaf ear idol passes ears unknown god heart unknown father 
god help home cried ginevra stood great loneliness return 
instant spied seated upon stone little way close path beast boy 
could mistake 
heard described children gamekeeper cottage 
hair sticking head though sun made look like crown gold shining mist 
bare arms dreadful indeed bare legs feet used bare arms worst making absolutely certain beast boy playing upon curious kind whistling thing making dreadfully sweet music entice nearer might catch tear pieces answer god sent prayer offered sore need beast boy asked protection deliverance beast boy asked help home right middle path sat beast boy waiting well like said sundays churches books miss machar made read horrid creature music power would rather run black water glooming holes drowned beast boy eat girls would screamed ginny natural mode meeting difficulty 
fear far likely choke cry 
sat stared 
perhaps would go away found could entice 
move kept playing curious instrument 
perhaps returning hollow could make circuit pass lower hill 
rose ran 
gibbie seen long saw experience afraid frightening 
therefore drawn gradually near sat unaware presence 
treating would bird wanted make better acquaintance would get accustomed look made advances 
saw run direction swamp knowing dangerous place terrified sprung feet darted get danger 
heard coming like wind back whether bewilderment intend throwing water escape instead pursuing former design made straight swamp 
beast boy ubiquitous approached place edge great hole half full water sitting hour going drown hole turned ran towards descent mountain 
gibbie feared certain precipitous spot besides path direction 
ginevra run far saw right way 
threw ground despair hid face 
thus hunting cat might mouse lion man could look would pounce upon tear pieces fearfully expectant horrible grasp lay breathless 
nothing came 
still lay still nothing came 
could dreaming dreams generally hideous thing never arrived 
dared look 
lay lay weary still terror slowly ebbing away 
length ears came strange sweet voice singing sound never heard 
seemed come far away angel god sending answer prayer deliver beast boy would course want time come certainly harm happened yet 
sound grew grew came nearer nearer 
although song could distinguish vowel melody nothing tone melody crooning ever upon one vowel minor key 
came quite near length yet even something far away sound left 
like wind summer night inside great church bell deserted tower 
came close ceased suddenly like lark angel ceased sing moment lighted 
opened eyes looked 
stood beast boy gazing upon could really beast boy fascinating devour easily read snakes birds could believe 
still could take eyes certain 
marvel great crown reddish gold looked two eyes heaven blue eyes looked something dwells behind sky every blue thing 
angel try taken form beast boy beast boy could sing like heard look like saw lay motionless flat ground face turned sideways upon hands eyes fixed heavenly vision 
curious feeling began wake seen somewhere ever long ago sight well misery something made stain would come 
yes face larger still sweeter little naked child angus cruelly lashed ages ago forgotten never could forget either child back lovely innocent white face turned round upon 
indeed perhaps would remember 
case certain would hurt 
looked thus gibbie face grew grave seldom grave fronting face fellow creature remembering trying recollect dream sickness pain saw face like one yet 
ginevra recollected first sweet slow diffident smile crept like dawn depth world sky face settled eyes made two stars 
rose sun gibbie flashed full response daylight smile woman girl matron could mistrust 
brow chin face radiant 
sun world made nest hair smile seemed dim aureole wore 
timidly yet trustingly ginevra took one hand cheek stretched 
clasped gently

knew mortal donal mother continued affect creature higher world come mission good men 
time oddly enough feeling beast boy still somewhere far held aloof presence angel assumed shape 
gibbie took hand led towards path left yielded without movement question 
lead far direction turned left mountain
