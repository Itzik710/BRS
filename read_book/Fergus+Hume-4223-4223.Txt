closed evidence defense crown prosecutor made speech pointed strong evidence prisoner calton arose address jury 
fine speaker made splendid defense 
single point escaped brilliant piece oratory still remembered spoken admiringly purlieus temple court chancery lane 
began giving vivid description circumstances murder meeting murderer victim collins street east cab driving st kilda getting cab murderer committing crime way secured pursuit 
thus enchained attention jury graphic manner described crime pointed evidence brought forward prosecution purely circumstantial utterly failed identify prisoner dock man entered cab 
supposition prisoner man light coat one person rested solely upon evidence cabman royston although intoxicated judging statements fit state distinguish man hailed cab man got 
crime committed means chloroform therefore prisoner guilty must purchased chloroform shop obtained friends 
events prosecution brought forward single piece evidence show chloroform obtained 
regard glove belonging murdered man found prisoner pocket picked ground time first met whyte deceased lying drunk near scotch church 
certainly evidence show prisoner picked deceased entered cab hand evidence show picked cab 
far likely glove especially white glove would picked light lamp near scotch church easily noticeable darkness cab little room would quite dark blinds drawn 
cabman royston swore positively man got cab st kilda road wore diamond ring forefinger right hand cabman rankin swore thing man got powlett street 
could placed evidence one prisoner intimate friends one seen almost daily last five years sworn positively prisoner habit wearing rings 
cabman rankin also sworn man entered cab st kilda road alighted powlett street east melbourne two clock friday morning heard hour strike post office clock whereas evidence prisoner landlady showed plainly entered house five minutes previously evidence supported watchmaker dendy 
mrs sampson saw hand kitchen clock point five minutes two thinking ten minutes slow told detective prisoner enter house till five minutes past two would give man alighted cab presuming prisoner sufficient time walk lodgings 
evidence watchmaker dendy however showed clearly put clock right hour eight thursday night impossible gain ten minutes two friday morning therefore time five minutes two seen landlady correct one prisoner house five minutes man alighted cab powlett street 
points sufficient show prisoner innocent evidence woman pawlins must prove conclusively jury prisoner man committed crime 
witness brown proved woman rawlins delivered letter gave prisoner prisoner left club keep appointment spoken letter letter rather remains put evidence 
woman rawlins swore prisoner met corner russell bourke streets gone one back slums see writer letter 
also proved time committal crime prisoner still back slum bed dying woman one door room could possibly left without witness seeing 
woman rawlins proved left prisoner corner bourke russell streets twenty five minutes two clock five minutes royston drove cab st kilda police station dead body inside 
finally woman rawlins proved words stating saw post office town hall clocks supposing prisoner started corner bourke russell streets says would reach east melbourne twenty minutes made five minutes two friday morning time according landlady statement entered house 
evidence given different witnesses agreed completely formed chain showed whole prisoner movements time committal murder 
therefore absolutely impossible murder could committed man dock 
strongest piece evidence brought forward prosecution witness hableton swore prisoner used threats life deceased 
language used merely outcome passionate irish nature sufficient prove crime committed prisoner 
defense prisoner set alibi evidence witnesses defense proved conclusively prisoner could commit murder 
finally calton wound elaborate exhaustive speech lasted two hours brilliant peroration calling upon jury base verdict upon plain facts case could hardly fail bringing verdict guilty 
calton sat subdued murmur applause heard instantly suppressed judge began sum strongly favor fitzgerald 
jury retired immediately dead silence crowded court unnatural silence must fallen blood loving roman populace saw christian martyrs kneeling hot yellow sands arena watched long lithe forms lion panther creeping steadily towards prey

hands clock moved slowly round quarter half three quarters hour sounded silvery ring startled everyone 
madge sitting hands tightly clasped together began fear highly strung nerves would give way 
god muttered softly suspense never end door opened jury entered 
prisoner placed dock judge resumed seat time black cap pocket everyone guessed 
usual formalities gone foreman jury stood every neck craned forward every ear alert catch words fell lips 
prisoner flushed little grew pale death giving quick nervous glance quiet figure black could catch glimpse 
came verdict sharp decisive guilty 
hearing cheer went everyone court strong sympathy brian 
vain crier court yelled order red face

right conjecture knew something likely lead detection whyte murderer tell reasons keeping thing secret sure blame 
mind say know committed murder suspicions strong suspicions wish god rosanna moore died told 
however tell leave judge whether justified concealing told 
call office time next week learn everything rosanna moore told possessed knowledge pity 
extraordinary mused calton leaning back chair laid letter 
wonder tell killed whyte sal rawlins perjured save nonsense turned better time risked neck last moment 
though make rule never surprised anything expect brian fitzgerald tell startle considerably 
never met extraordinary case appearances end reached yet 
said mr calton thoughtfully truth stranger fiction 
knock came door answer invitation enter opened kilsip glided room

oh dear answered calton carelessly come come kilsip closed door softly gliding along usual velvet footed manner sat chair near calton placing hat ground looked keenly barrister 
well kilsip said calton yawn playing watch chain good news tell well nothing particularly new purred detective rubbing hands together 
nothing new nothing true matter said calton quoting emerson 
come see hansom cab murder replied quietly 
deuce cried calton startled professional dignity 
found answered kilsip rather dismally idea 
gorby retorted calton dryly idea ended smoke 
practical proofs yet 
means going get possible 
much virtue quoted calton picking pencil scribbling idly blotting paper 
suspicion point aha said mr kilsip cautiously 
know answered coolly family name humbug presume 
bosh suspect kilsip looked round cautiously make sure alone said stage whisper roger moreland young man gave evidence whyte got drunk kilsip nodded 
well connect murder remember evidence given cabmen royston rankin swore man whyte night wore diamond ring forefinger right hand nearly every second man melbourne wears diamond ring forefinger right hand

another blow theory 
murderer evening dress cabman said

madge clinging husband arm felt eyes fill tears saw land birth receding slowly 
good bye murmured softly 
good bye ever

regret answered looking loving eyes 
side fear nothing 
surely hearts tried furnace affliction love chastened purified 
sure nothing world replied brian sigh 
sorrow grief past let us hope future peace 
peace white winged sea gull rose suddenly crimson waters circled rapidly air 
happy omen said looking fondly grave face husband life mine
