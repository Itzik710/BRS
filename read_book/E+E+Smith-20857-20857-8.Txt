hi breck burly one called strode instrument desk chief pilot tossed bag carelessly corner 
behold computer flesh howl fuss poor computation hello steve chief pilot smiled shook hands cordially 
glad see try kid old man 
simple enough believe almost anything things done 
yelling yelling hard trained computers ever since started riding us every one centimeter change acceleration know p computer digger indian

fifteen minutes remained time one department head another would report captain liner everything charge ready stupendous flight 
x steve breckenridge turned computer 
check acceleration power observatory good old bean younger man frowned thought 
figure like astronomers navigators 
made allowances anything even reversal figure four thousands minor detours 
check station errors check station errors always right fool got troubles anybody else 
fact study charts last weeks pretty sure e least four thousand kilometers side thinks w ten twelve thousand beyond station got lateral displacement simply fierce 
going check argue pass 
another thing figure two places got third place almost solid expect get smooth curve 
hundredth centimeter acceleration means lot long trip holding us close 
ride trip 
centimeters scheduled mass means thirty six points four seven kilofranks plus equilibrium power 
set go computer stated changed fractions arc course plotters automatic integrating goniometer 
doctor glad explain observatory breckenridge set exceedingly delicate excess power potentiometer exactly upon indicated figure 
well got minutes left chin chin lift 
commotion dish low 
well like steve 
pilots one sweet time growled every trip 
management squawks thirty seconds plus minus terminals passenger department squalls change acceleration five centimeters total en route claims upsets dainty customers loses business road 
tightening us time 
couple years ago remember make difference acceleration long checked somewhere near zero time used spin em dizzy reversed half way station kind stuff go 
got hold acceleration constant close normal got hold schedule zero plus minus ten seconds yet got make detours tell us seven million kilometer thing handed us 
make things worse got take orders every check station yet get blame everything happens consequence obeying orders course know well rotten technique change acceleration every check station told em better put real computer every ship tell check stations report meteorites obstructions us let us alone 
better recommend us computers getting rotten computation sure thing blame pilots yelling believe got right answer 
help think astronomers lying job 
sure pilots blame occurred check carefully 
however know pretty quick take steps 
hope say steve worried using much plus equilibrium power 
remember got hit absolutely good shape plenty heads drop 
say 
know passengers howl hold weightless half hour waiting two moons get way know manager check minus thirty one minutes 
wow swell bust sure 
worry breck check right anybody head wants taking full responsibility know 
welcome 
breckenridge shrugged turned conversation lighter vein 
speaking weightlessness funny many weight fiends world think passengers would enjoy little weightlessness occasionally especially fat ones say think come loose make check thought two big three solving mysteries universe stay last trip work ether force field theory advanced stuff go mars venus get 
got back last week 
solving mysteries laugh old hyena 
lot dim bulbs think roeser rays last word nothing left discover going get jarred loose hinges one days 
came nine months ago hot trail something big bet bring upon dock insistent siren blared crescendo diminuendo blast sound two minutes remained 
every stateroom every lounge saloon speakers sounded warning short time pulling clear gravitational field earth walking somewhat difficult everything board apparently increase weight one fifth present amount 
please remain seated move caution 
hour weight gradually return normal 
start one minute 
hipe barked chief pilot flaring purple light sprang upon board assistants came attention stations 
seconds four three two one lift touched button set plunger switches drove home releasing forty five enormous driving projectors equilibrium power fifteen thousand odd kilofranks energy exactly counterbalanced pull gravity upon mass cruiser 
simultaneously added potentiometer already set exact figure given computer plus equilibrium power would changed throughout journey ideal acceleration curve registered upon recorders immense mass cruiser void wafted vertically upward low constant velocity 
bellowing shrieking siren cleared air magically swarm aircraft path quietly calmly majestically arcturus floated upward 
breckenridge sixty seconds initial lift actuated system magnetic relays would gradually cut precisely measured starting power would necessary employ sixty nine minutes without acceleration given additional power would lose many precious hours time covering merely thousands miles earth attraction would operate powerfully progress 
faster faster great cruiser shot upward starting power released heavier heavier passengers felt become 
soon full calculated power acceleration became constant 
weight longer increased remained constant value plus twenty three six tenths percent 
moments uneasy stomachs among passengers perhaps first trippers made ill much worse riding high speed elevator particularly since change positive negative acceleration experienced express elevators 
computer calculations complete watched pilot interest accustomed traversing depths space never failing thrill scientific mind delicacy precision work breckenridge work could done man long training profession possessed instantaneous nervous reaction highest degree manual dexterity control 
right left hands double series potentiometers actuating variable speed drives flight angle directors hour declination ranges eyes finely marked micrometer screen upon guiding goniometer threw needle point light powerful optical systems prisms lenses revealed sight director angles fractional seconds arc 
task chief pilot hold screened image cross hairs two directors position relative ever moving point light hold mighty vessel precisely upon course spite complex system forces acting upon 
almost hour breckenridge sat motionless eyes flashing micrometer screen signal panel sensitive fingers moving potentiometers minute arcs saw upon screen instantaneous response flashing multi colored lights tinkling signals board 
finally far earth moon attraction perturbing forces comparatively slight signals longer sounded point light ceased irregular motion becoming almost stationary 
chief pilot brought cross hairs directly upon brilliant point time approaching nearly adjusted photo cells amplifiers would hold immovably upon calculated second time cut starting power means another set automatically timed relays 
regular driving power left acceleration checked found exactly designated value 
centimeters stood heaved profound sigh relief 
well steve way 
always glad part done 
ticklish job fooling even expert mathematician agreed 
wonder astronomers think birds ones gumming dope 
well time plug e 
fireworks start closed connections transferred central portion upper lookout screen small micrometer screen breckenridge desk plugged first check station 
instantly point red light surrounded vivid orange circle appeared upon screen low left center timing galvanometer showed wide positive deflection 
hashed growled breckenridge 
must losing grip guess 
put everything sight missed ten divisions 
think turn badge cocked perfect curve already got first check station hands moved toward controls correct course acceleration 
hold everything lay controls snapped computer 
something screwy thought either 
pilot course know good compensation see compensating point never saw done 
besides skill figures know darn well tenth one division 
cuckoo call let start refer 
x glad pass buck 
still think steve playing dynamite 
ever heard astronomer wrong surprised grinned physicist since fuss started nobody tried find whether wrong ipv arcturus attention came speaker curtly 
ipv arcturus breckenridge chief pilot 
ray almost minute 
correcting course acceleration doctor stevens computing us full control course acceleration replied breckenridge 
answer 
changing neither course acceleration position declared stevens crisply please give present supposed location latest precision goniometer bearings sun moon mars venus tellurian reference limb exact time observations gyroscope zero planes goniometer factors correct shall report observatory e answered loftily paying attention demand proof position 
sure guy report station taken precision bearing month 
report muddling along radio loop bearings know within seven thousand kilometers 
speaking reporting know already lot astronomical guessers faintest possible idea really plus minus lateral get straightened get w going make report account jar birds loose upper teeth unplugged vicious jerk turned pilot grin 
guess hold report us sure remonstrated breckenridge 
older man plainly ill ease open defiance supposedly infallible check stations 
baby returned computer confidently 
bet small farm plugged nickel right working goniometer hard pivots getting hot 
sneak back position soon calculate results pretend always 
others right probably time get gosh unusually dumb today breck 
tell anybody anything want goat oh see 
could dope recorder charts know kind stuff pilots humps altogether big accounted anything know 
another thing next station p think keeping x corrected e wrong throw p right bad hump almost every check station 
see true prediction pilot ray p came almost upon exact center micrometer screen breckenridge smiled relief began really enjoy trip 
check chronometers asked p stevens introduced 
time seem two half seconds plus x two points four seconds plus riding 
centimeters allow reversal minor detours 
bye 
may coincidence breck find pretty quick computer remarked flying vessel nearing third check station 
unless control check almost fourteen seconds minus w may even find center block screen 
plugged w block extreme upper right corner 
checked thirteen eight tenths seconds minus station fiery dialogue ensued computer questioned accuracy location station refused point blank correct course 
well breck old onion tears stevens declared unplugged 
use going bum reference points 
going report newton rock observatory foundations plugged telegraph room 
got free high power wave please put newton main office 
moving lights flashed flickered instant upon communicator screen settling white glow soon resolved likeness keen eyed gray haired man seated desk remote office interplanetary corporation 
newton smiled recognized likeness stevens upon screen greeted cordially 
started investigation doctor stevens started finished stevens tersely reported learned concluding see need special computers ships hen needs teeth 
got computers need observatories got make work trade 
piloting x absolutely curve far exactly flat ever since cut starting power 
course pilots good breckenridge give good computation good check points get humps higher half centimeter 
get director assured 
thanks 
work trip done might show little girl nadia around arcturus 
never interested 
would mind glad mr newton regular uncle 
thanks operator speak captain king please 
pipe guff unlicked cub crown proof bar chief pilot growled soon stevens unplugged 
else retorted computer cheerfully 
pipe guy darn dumb complex know crack pilot outfit care else knew 
stevens carefully covered put away calculating machine apparatus using turned pilot 
know newton kids especially little ones got acquainted long ago 
course know well since never around office much old tiger goes big 
hm think enjoy playing nursemaid rest trip breckenridge asked caustically enigmatic smile 
think know replied stevens positively 
always like kids always like fall like ten thousand bricks falling well 
kid kid team like grace poise gnawing anyway make turn cheshire cat sudden looks grin say swallowed canary mine way darned know lost stared friend suspiciously 
borrow phrase steve surprised breckenridge though making effort conceal amusement would say 
minutes door opened stepped grizzled four striper 
almost hidden behind massive form girl ran breckenridge seized hands eyes sparkling 
hi breckie old darling knew kept long enough dad would let ride sometime 
gorgeous stevens glad indeed girl enthusiastic greeting pilot giving time recover shock director newton little girl nadia precisely led expect 
little might particularly compared giant frame captain king steve five feet eleven stature hundred ninety pounds rawhide whalebone body child certainly 
thick fair hair cut square bob mode moment indicated nature intended creamy blonde turned introduced stevens received another surprise one rare exceedingly attractive beings natural blonde brown eyes black eyebrows 
sun wind tanned satin skin smooth even shade brown every movement lithe supple body bespoke discerning mind rigidly trained physique 
doctor stevens met miss newton hear captain introduced informally 
officers actually tied posts anxious honors vessel received direct orders owners turning show around 
thanks captain mutiny bit order 
mighty glad know miss newton 
heard lot doctor 
dad breckie always talking big three done going 
want meet doctor brandon doctor westfall hand met firm friendly clasp 
turned captain stevens noticing pilot quizzical expression say something silenced fierce aside 
clam ape climb like squirrel hissed grinning breckenridge nodded assent demand silence concerning children nursemaids 
since never miss newton want see whole works stevens addressed girl 
want begin shall start top work right agreed fell step beside 
dressed dove gray head foot toque blouse breeches heavy stockings shoes one shade smooth lustrous silk strolled together passage way effortless ease perfect poise carriage called aloud every hard schooled fiber highly trained 
lot alike know asked abruptly unconventionally 
yes felt replied frankly studied without affectation 
come 
fine condition hard training 
athlete kind sure star ought recognize ashamed say swim 
oh course stevens great olympic high fancy diver would never connected doctor stevens eminent mathematical physicist king springboard 
say ever since quit afraid water yen two half twist never met anybody knew well enough teach almost broken back forty times trying learn alone got american british womens golf champion 
shake two shook hands vigorously mutual congratulation 
tell give pointers diving show make golf ball behave 
next norman brandon got vicious hook captivity norm help 
left handed know southpaw naturally wild 
slices woods hooks irons 
consistent anyway hook everything even putts 
bargain shoot pretty dubby 
usually middle eighties none us play much space time know sometimes hook going particularly well go nineties 
lick hook promised entered elevator borne upward toward prow great interplanetary cruiser 
chapter ii arrive climb rest way foot stevens told companion elevator stopped uppermost passenger floor 
walked across small circular hall guard duty came attention saluted approached 
orders pass miss newton sir 
know combinations know good old tub better men built helped calculate stevens replied stepped apparently blank wall steel deftly manipulated almost invisible dial set flush surface 
keep passengers belong explained section wall swung backward short arc slid smoothly aside 
proceed see makes tick 
ladder ladder steel climbed bulkhead bulkhead opened stevens knowing touch 
floor mathematician explained girl operation machinery automatically work devices heating cooling devices circulating maintaining purifying air water short complex mechanism necessary comfort convenience human cargo liner 
soon entered conical top compartment room scarcely fifteen feet diameter tapering sharply upward hollow point twenty feet 
true shape room however immediately apparent enormous latticed beams girders braced walls every direction 
air glowed violet light twelve great ultra light projectors like searchlights three foot lenses lined wall 
floor beneath feet level steel platform seemed composed many lenticular sections dull blue alloy 
standing upon upper lookout lenses asked girl 
perfectly right sure 
hard nothing scratch course roeser rays go right bodies ordinary substance like bullet hole swiss cheese 
even lenses deflect solid fields force 
spoke one ultra lights flashed around short quick arc girl saw instead fierce glare expected emitted soft violet light 
nevertheless dodged involuntarily stevens touched arm reassuringly 
x miss newton harmless mice 
hardly ever swing past vertical even one shines right look right eye long want hurt bit 
ultra violet none whatever 
color one many remaining crudities ultra light vision 
lot good men studying thing direct vision though long system really work 
think perfectly wonderful breathed 
think traveling comfort empty space actually seeing seamless steel walls without even sign window things possible go pretty well back warned adequate explanation bound fairly deep wading spots 
technical stand go middling deep took lot general science physics advanced mechanics 
course get highly specialized stuff sub electronics roeser rays start drowning yell 
fine get idea x go 
let sit girder 
roeser means even though got credit merely helped martians 
whole thing started course goddard shot first rocket moon intensified roeser perfected short waves signals exchanged mars signals neither side could make sense 
goddard pupils followers made bigger better rockets finally got one could land safely upon mars 
roeser mighty keen bird one first voyagers come back stayed living space suit three four years got brand new education 
martian science always hot know impractical 
desperately hard water air lot wonderful ideas theories overcome practical technical difficulties way making ideas work 
putting peoples ideas work roeser long suit think belittling roeser either brave far sighted man mean scientist certainly one best organizers synchronizers world ever known since martian tellurian science complemented one filled gaps long fleets space freighters bringing air water venus needed wanted 
done could martians learned stuff wanted know roeser came back tellus organized interplanetary scientists engineers three planets set work improve whole system vessels used dangerous regular mankillers fact 
time roeser interplanetary corporation big part unification world one nation wars could longer interfere progress 
introduction get fundamentals 
molecules particles first order vibrations first order include sound light heat electricity radio 
second order atoms extremely short vibrations hard x rays 
third order electrons protons accompanying millikan cosmic rays 
fourth order sub electrons sub protons 
material aspect supposed particles fourth order energy aspect known roeser rays 
fourth order rays particles seem partake nature energy matter 
following right behind assured 
listening intently wide spaced brown eyes fastened upon face 
since roeser rays particles rays fourth order seem matter energy since rays converted supposed particles thought things electrons protons built 
therefore everybody except norman brandon supposed ultimate units creation would useless try go taught ultimate units protested 
know really know anything except learned empirically even driving forces 
called fourth order particle absolutely unknown since nobody able detect say nothing determining velocity properties 
assumed velocity light hypothesis conflict observational data 
going give generally accepted idea since nothing definite offer place warn idea probably wrong 
lot deep stuff dug yet 
fact brandon thinks product conversion think actual fundamental unit primary mechanism transformation lie somewhere fourth order possibly even level ether able find point attack yet let us get anywhere 
however getting way ahead subject 
get back energy converted something acts like matter roeser rays empirical fact underlying drive space ships well almost vehicles three planets 
power generated great waterfalls tellus venus water mighty scarce mars course plants use fuel transmitted light beams means powerful fields force receptors wherever may 
individual transmitting fields receptors really simply matched frequency units matching electrical characteristics particular unique beam force 
beam composed roeser rays energy aspect 
took long time work tight beam transmission power fairly simple got 
took voluminous notebook sight nadia smiled 
computer might forget dress never catch one without full magazine pencil lot blank paper grinned reply went writing talked 
given frequency f phase angle theta integrate limits zero pi divided two sine theta hold sinking nadia exclaimed 
integrate unless absolutely necessary 
long stick general science right heels please lay integrations especially stay away terrible electrical integrations 
always think poisonous kind known 
want general idea understand anyway 
sure forgot guess getting deeper necessary especially since whole thing beam transmission pretty crude yet bound change lot long 
much loss get hundred million kilometers away power plant lose reception entirely 
get going receptors receive beam power sent accumulators stored 
accumulators outgrowth storage battery 
theory accumulator lay theory please listener interrupted 
understand perfectly without 
energy stored accumulators put take 
necessary 
like give theory add much understanding working things might mix pretty deep stuff 
would take lot time rest friends would squawk kept indefinitely 
accumulators power fed converters backed projector 
converters simply change aspect rays energy aspect material aspect 
soon done highly charged particles whatever thus formed repelled terrific stationary force maintained projector backing converter 
particle departs velocity supposed light recoil upon projector drives vessel car whatever attached 
still struggling little nose still surface 
particles infinitesimally small even detected go right substance without effect even harmful 
exactly 
position go ahead lights detectors 
energy aspect rays best understand simply vibration ether extremely high frequency one 
rigidly scientific close enough 
nobody knows stuff really explained demonstrated model concept three dimensional space 
physical mathematical interpretation way grasped requires sixteen coordinates four dimensions suppose care go 
say exclaimed feelingly 
well anyway use suitable fields force used carrier wave 
stuff fields force carry modulation frequency changes necessary figured martians ages ago 
used pure carrier wave sender receiver end bad communicator radio systems work well 
pretty good really ultra light vision system something else 
sending heterodyned wave steel easy breaking view object return impulses awful job one half done yet 
see things fashion distance kilometers sending almost parallel wave twin projector disintegrate double back viewing wave 
way lookout plates lenses work ship master screens control room plates staterooms lifeboats viewing areas promenades 
whole system rotten makeshift minute exclaimed girl 
everybody else thinking everything absolutely perfect yet every single thing talked ended describing unknown rudimentary temporary makeshift 
speak though entire system poor thing something better found nobody knows anything anything get way working brandon westfall 
birds got real brains track something probability far ahead roeser rays present system ahead science seventeenth century 
really looked astonishment 
tell 
done refused 
know much even know much come 
little know tell mine 
working yes sense small boy helps father build house 
brains simply figuring want waste time 
nadia belief whatever modest disclaimer secret greatly pleased attitude replied course say anything unfinished project asked 
go lining hull outside passengers quarters upper dirigible projectors led way series steep steel stairways bulkheads partitions steel 
one thing forgot tell detectors 
worked principle lights efficient 
instead light though send cones electro magnetic waves set induced currents conductor encountered beyond shell 
since dangerous meteorites shown contain conducting material enough locate radio finders automatically determine direction distance magnitude disturbance swing light 
happened light swung toward us back prow 
life boats heard discussed much lately near asked girl 
lots em one right next landing opened vacuum insulated steel door snapped light waved hand 
see much complete space ship capable maintaining dozen fifteen persons two weeks cruise space 
good idea retain accidents still possible course question away entirely 
modern ships however enough take care largest number persons ever carried vessel 
arcturus needs say everything else except room pay load 
heard talking junking 
think shame 
way see helped design sister ship sirius brandon westfall using floating laboratory 
times change inefficient must go 
good old tub built everybody afraid space put every safety factor could think 
result four times heavy takes lot extra power 
skin thick 
many batteries accumulators many life boats many bulkheads air breaks many much everything 
built break space nobody would die lived shock many bulkheads air breaks life boats matter many pieces broke survivors would find something able navigate 
excessive construction longer necessary 
modern ships carry ten times pay load one quarter power old battle wagon uses 
even though four years old relic days used slam ecliptic route right meteoric stuff always trusting heavy armor ward anything small observers detectors locate 
observatories check stations space fairly light armor sufficient route well away ecliptic miss heavy stuff 
badly hate see go old tub bound junk yard 
flights stairs brought upper band dirigible projectors encircled hull outside passengers quarters sixty feet prow 
heavy search light like affairs mounted upon massive universal bearings free turn direction converter nestling inside prodigious field force 
stevens explained projectors used turning vessel dodging meteorites necessary went another almost invisible door hall took elevator main corridor 
well seen miss newton stevens said regretfully led toward captain office 
lower half full heavy stuff accumulators machinery driving projectors junk center gravity center action driving projectors 
makes stable flight possible 
less like seen suppose want miss dance anyway lot people want dance 
soon show lower half dance rather lots would dance time want see everything 
let go went past battery battery accumulators climbing around ever increasing number huge steel girders bracers mazes heavily insulated wiring conduits past mass mass automatic machinery stevens explained eager listener 
inspected one great driving projectors built rigidly parallel axis ship held immovably place enormous trusses steel revealed neither eye ear sign terrific force exerting 
still lower went girl shown everything even bottom ultra lights stern braces 
tired stevens asked inspection completed 

quite climb wonderful time 
declared positively 
know crawl one stern lifeboats make us cup coffee climb back 
way ahead nadia accepted invitation enthusiastically made way nearest miniature space cruisers 
although emergency encountered four years vessel life found everything readiness two soon prepared eaten hearty luncheon 
well think excuses monopolizing miss newton suppose take back 
believe enjoyed realize broke listened every nerve taut 
exclaimed 
hear anything something screwy somewhere felt vibration anything make mountain steel even quiver must given us one gosh awful nudge 
another girl painfully tense felt barely perceptible tremor computer knowing far better inconceivable strength mass enormous structure solidly braced hardened steel sprang action 
leaping small dirigible look plate turned power swung upward 
great suffering snakes ejaculated stood mute plate revealed terrible sight 
entire nose gigantic craft sheared two immense slices though clipped gigantic sword even stared fascinated sight severed slices drifting slowly away 
swinging view along plane cleavage stevens made relatively tiny ball metal fifty feet diameter distance perhaps mile 
ball shot blinding plane light arcturus fell apart midsection lower half separating clean upper portion held passengers 
leaving upper half intact attacker began slicing lower driving half thin disk shaped sections 
incandescent plane destruction made first flashing cut body arcturus accompanied additional pyrotechnic display severed short circuited high tension leads stevens nadia suddenly found floating weightless air room 
still gripping controls look plate stevens caught white faced girl one hand drew beside held motionless keen mind flashed possibilities situation planned course action 
apparently slicing us pretty evenly looks things one cut coming right explained rapidly found flashlight drew companion door along narrow passage 
soon opened another door led tiny compartment low could stand upright mere cubicle steel 
carefully closing door fingered dials upon walls cell folded comfortable position instructed nadia snapped light 
please leave shaken girl asked 
ghastly better save nadia advised pressing arm reassuringly light got may need worse later life limited know 
later think need anything later sure course may get us nadia little tertiary air break mighty small target hit 
miss us think larger room opening wall one least one certainly left intact 
one rooms reach life boat 
course little much expect one life boats left whole bulkheaded know sure finding something able navigate providing make get away 
believe ace sure glad aboard old arcturus right safety devices instead one modern liners 
sunk right 
felt sunk enough minute feeling better though since taking calmly 
sure man dead heart stops beating know turn come next let little 
suppose change width slices hit cubby small bad shrugged 
case never know hit us good worrying 
say might something hit us square 
move fairly fast might able get door open loss pressure seals 
light flash hold hands free 
put arms around arms stick like porous plaster move jump like chain lightning 
shine beam right reflect light dials 
hold tight come spoke jarring shudder shook one side hiding place moment later phenomenon repeated much less force upon side 
stevens sighed relief took light extinguished 
missed us clean exulted 
find us set 
possibly find us seem always worried wrong things think finding us would least troubles 
judge vision system got everything apparently 
however apparatus may delicate enough spot us space small projectors flash probably 
couple big items favor nobody else entire lower half since machinery either automatic else controlled expecting see anybody get far conspicuous 
dressed gray clothes particular almost exactly color armor plate altogether stand good chance missed 
shall nothing whatever wish could sleep couple hours course hope 
stretch like rest folded like accordion lie diagonally across room 
room way 
one advantage weightlessness lie standing head go sleep like 
forgot never weightless make sick much except feel awfully weird inside 
horribly dizzy nauseated first going away 
good makes lots people pretty sick 
fact folks get awfully sick seem get used 
canals inner ear know 
however well already regular spacehound half hour 
weightless weeks stretch sirius got really like 
better keep touch 
found hand tucked arm 
stabilize positions besides keeping us getting lonesome dark concluded matter fact voice 
thanks saying us would wave admiration went real chivalrous manhood man forced circumstances cast lot 
long must stay long air lasts like stay longer 
want move around absolutely rays us way knowing long 
also better keep still 
know kind audio system got use taking unnecessary chances 
x oyster little sister many minutes two remained motionless silent 
nadia twitched started vague real imaginary sound fingers tightened upon biceps pressed hand great arm reassurance understanding 
wall cell resounded impact fierce blow stevens instantly threw arm around girl twisting threatened wall ready emergency 
nothing happened door remained closed cell stayed bottle tight time wore slowly 
soon unmistakable symptoms breathing unfit atmosphere made apparent stevens testing doors drew girl larger room breathed deeply fresh cool air 
know room whole asked nadia 
might stepped space room lost tightness door opened 
open difference one kilogram pressure two sides 
knew room first cut two door air break move 
comes next know exactly better hold little council war 
may gone stevens broke structure began move settled upon one side walls 
greater greater became acceleration apparent weight almost much would upon earth point became constant 
continued interrupted sentence 
seems capture seizure well attack take risk looking 
besides getting cold 
one two adjoining cells apparently ruptured radiating heat space get life boat freeze 
go pick best one 
wonder better take hide come back worry coming nadia declared positively 
well probably assented set 
thorough exploration tight connecting cells revealed lifeboat within reach remained intact habitable navigable portions three craft available 
selecting completely equipped took residence therein entering closing massive insulating door 
stevens disconnected lights save one shielded one turning merely lightened utter darkness semi permeable gloom 
stepped lookout plate hand upon control pondered long possible consequences wished 
harm would take little peek know dickens 
maybe none maybe lot 
see know 
thing know got us beat hundred ways got act accordingly 
got chance sometime though ever get away might well 
put short range first see see 
small number cells got afraid split us lengthwise instead whole slice old watermelon live got sixth one shaped like piece restaurant pie 
one thing though 
turn communicator receiver put full coverage maybe hear something useful 
putting little power upon visiray plate moved point projection short distance hiding place plate showed view wreckage 
upper half vessel still intact lower half jumble sharply cut fragments 
larger pieces brilliant ray tangible force stretched outward 
suddenly receiver sounded behind high powered transmitter telegraph room tried notify headquarters plight 
arcturus attacked cut taken tow rapidly message uttered transmitter died rattle middle word nadia looked stevens foreboding eyes 
got something one thing sure able neutralize communicator beams way admitted 
good play close vests girl trying cheer really think chance demanded 
want know stand 
coming clean kidding 
get away x bet farm time brandon got everything birds maybe 
beat us 
kind afraid though getting away going quite simple shooting fish well 
far ahead port opened lifeboat shot full power receiver tried burst sound vain attempt 
sound died one complete word could uttered lifeboat power completely neutralized rays tiny craft enemy floated gently back toward mass parent accompanied headlong flight 
several lifeboats made attempt courageous officers arcturus apparently succeeded eluding vigilance captors launched little shells various ports boat issued power neutralized found dragged helplessly along grip one mysterious brilliant rays force 
least one hidden officer must watching fruitless efforts next lifeboat issue made attempt either talk flee flamed space concentrated beam destruction terrible ray annihilation known substance could endure moment ray definitely outlawed war 
even frightful weapon useless spent force harmlessly upon impalpable invisible barrier hundred yards source bold lifeboat disappeared one blinding explosion incandescence captor showed real power retaliation 
stevens jaw hard set leaped screen brought quickly skated across smooth steel floor 
shutting lookout plate led half fainting girl across room comfortable seat sat beside raging thoughtful 
nadia soon recovered 
acting contrary nature demanded 
dozen times seen start something change mind 
load hinder anything want 
told father look going replied indirectly 
would anyway course even ten twelve years older thought 
yes dad never realized eight years old 
see going slaughtered flushed made reply 
case glad would silly 
think better hold council war mentioned ago need smoke indulge thanks 
tried times school never liked 
searched pockets bringing light unopened package tattered remnant proved contain one dilapidated cigarette 
studied thoughtfully 
smoke wreck decided still smokable 
save rest afraid long time smokes 
well let confer one sided conference 
imagine ideas prove particularly helpful 
talk listen 
tell ideas may useful chip time feel urge 
dope see 
highly intelligent creatures probability neither martians venerians 
stuff us would known besides believe would used way 
mercury habitable least organic beings never seen sign kind inhabitants could work metals rays 
probably jupiter although possibly away 
say jupiter would think judging small size ship may still experimental stage probably come away jupiter 
numerous somebody would sighted one 
give left leg four fingers one good look inside ship 
take never even looked toward one first glimpse 
say reason may automatic detectors suggested system vision crude use could detected clothesline basket full scrap iron 
resume aim capture destroy since killed anybody except one crew attacked 
apparently want study us something 
however intend us shall get away even send word happened us 
therefore looks though best bet hide try sneak away direct methods work 
right sound lucid 
possibility getting back though got anywhere near jupiter far away long stretch jupiter planets power plants right particularly mars tellus subtending angle something ninety degrees sun venus two jupiter clear across sun three

fairly close least one moons jupiter best chance good fact really think make 
good would us get back dire foreboding showed glorious eyes 
lots things tried yet girl try 
first get away 
second try get touch norman brandon known radio carry half far 
think radio yet unknown may able bare possibility able communicate 
oh wonderful lifts frightful load mind breathed 
minute said come clean 
odds us matter 
unknown radio work probably several things try pretty slim chances 
even get away probably thing though marooned desert island without tools rescue depending upon ability build high powered radio station call mainland help 
however try get away alternative letting know joining friends captivity 
know much 
imprisonment restraint certain death possible return earth almost certainly impossible life guests highly improbable 
steve way 
well time spring awake better fifty hours 
personally near dead physical wreck 
get us bite supper turn 
appetizing supper prepared abundant stores ate heartier meal either would believed possible 
stevens considered unopened package cigarettes regretfully put back pocket still unopened turned nadia 
well little fellow time shove 
might well sleep go 
anything scares yell 
good night old trapper wait minute steve 
nadia flushed brown eyes black eyebrows comparison golden blond hair lent face quizzical elfin expression far belied feelings stared straight eyes 
never even away earth happening simply scared death 
trying hide stand alone going together long close senseless conventions affect us 
two bunks sleep one returned steadfast gaze moment silence

life keep inviolate oh well insist 
good night steve gave radiant honest smile first smile seen since moment attack 
chapter iii castaways upon ganymede upon awakening man first care instruct girl operation projectors could keep heavily armored edge small section promptly christened forlorn hope grinding clashing mass wreckage thus become necessary protect relatively frail inner portions craft damage 
keep eye things nadia instructed soon could handle controls use power absolutely necessary 
need besides probably detect anything use 
probably enough leakage ruptured accumulator cells mask quite little emission use much 
going see making whole wedge navigable 
launch left lifeboat space worthy yes small 
two three big dirigible projectors lower band rim piece pie shaped section riding think 
enough batteries accumulators left intact give anywhere nearly full power get acceleration make lifeboat look sick 
main dirigibles know able swing whole mass arcturus one chunk got thousand tons mass piece something pretty 
also metal may save us months time mining

afraid time getting short steve announced making observation 
looks though getting wherever going 
well got two jobs hardest lot 
jupiter tell yet jupiter one satellites think point reversed power 
observation told take 
looks like jupiter agreed rapidly checked figures 
pass close one two satellites probably ganymede fine scheme 
four major satellites water atmosphere ganymede largest best purposes 
got couple days yet time finish 
let get going know 
steve afraid 
dangerous way none see 
close watch keeping every bit junk makes chance get away 
pretty sure happen get nipped use enough power let know worse tried pull stunt 
donned space suit filled looped belt tools picked portable power drill stepped tiny air lock 
nadia deftly guided segment one larger fragments held gentle steady pressure stevens light cable paying behind clambered carefully wreckage brought drill play disappeared inside huge wedge 
less hour returned without mishap reported glowing girl 
like shooting fish well accumulator cells tight installing relays bad job 
believe girl junk filling space saturn touch wonderful steve nadia exclaimed 
bad seeing go others one rigged 
around around mass wreckage crept larger sections stevens connected enormous fixed dirigible projectors whatever accumulator cells available sensitive relays could close means one radio impulse 
long dangerous task done stood lookout plate studying huge disk upper portion lower half arcturus frowning thought 
nadia reached shoulder switched plate 
nix second job big fellow declared 
really necessary altogether apt killed trying get 
ghastly stand trying ends 
ought really protested 
special tools cutting torches stuff sitting pretty 
lose weeks time 
lose 
get em baby get moon stop crying went familiar argument twentieth time 
stuff grinding together like cakes ice floe particular section want plain sight whoever watch tools things altogether heavy handle 
husky brute know even begin handle even good going 
help much even let try fact positively refuse let come along shows dangerous know attempt bound 
probably never even get alive say nothing getting back 
steve like light 
sure wish left us weightless sometime hour two mourned

luck extent 
time 
time worked us back tail end procession rather head end since traveling 
stevens took controls slowly worked along outer edge mass toward extremity 
nadia put one hand upon shoulder glanced around 
thanks steve 
perfectly wonderful chance gone far scheme together would crying shame able go 
hate like sin surrender could anything become 
besides voice died away silence 
sure right hastily replied dodging implication unfinished sentence 
figure anything looked particularly feasible anyway try

relays various fragments closed massed power accumulators shorted dead across converters projectors instead fed gradually controls pilot result comparable explosion ammunition dump 
masses whose projectors fed comparatively accumulator cells darted away entirely stupendous acceleration 
however received unimpeded flow complete batteries 
projectors tore loose even massive supports crashed anything opposing like huge armor piercing projectile 
spectacle stagger imagination stevens grinned turned girl staring wide eyed amazement 
well ace think busy enough safe take long wanted look controls flashed twin beams lookout light beyond upper half arcturus see stop abruptly mid space 
even extremely short carrier wave roeser rays could go invisible barrier thrown tiny powerful globe space 
penetration nadia asked 
flattened cold 
however fox remarked grapes bet sour anyway 
stuff one days 
sure hope fireworks started back keep birds amused get sight use much power projectors may juice enough left stop 
using enough suit heavy hardly lift finger better lift em must watch going back navigate around moon 
x chief got hands full apparently 
rays shooting around sky 
looks though trying capture four five things one 
good tell moon cuts 
awful acceleration using constantly increased terrific velocity traveling made good escape long placed satellite enemy stevens cut reversed power

pick location power plant 
must waterfall power good place hide ship observation like little seam coal 
use wood think find coal 
sedimentary rock looks lot like country along north fork flathead montana 
lot coal outcrops usually topography 
want hide hurry though particularly think 
missed us would us long ago damage projectors surprised one piece missing imagine lost good many 
know somebody caused disturbance 
hunt us maybe maybe telling 
however time land get checked ready hunt us mighty small needle well hidden good big haystack 
several hours roamed mountainous region high velocity seeking best possible location finally found one almost ideal narrow canyon overhung heavy trees opening wide deep gorge upon level floor 
mighty waterfall cascaded gorge canyon could seen black outcrops stevens close scrutiny declared coal 
deftly guided cumbersome wedge steel retreat allowed settle gently ground shut power 
well little fellow conspirator peace dignity jovians know wherever

suppose ought scared death steve thrilled words nadia answered eager sparkle eyes bore words 
go air shall wear suits go got weapon kind hurry let something pipe ace remember know anything around pig sunday conduct accordingly 
take easy 
surprised gravity 
certainly ganymede diameter fifty seven hundred kilometers 
remember correctly damoiseau estimated mass three one hundredths earth would make surface gravity one sixth 
however actually almost half see spring balance 
therefore quite little massive let go places things calm ginger got lots time quite afraid 
go analyze air sure lucky much 
exactly world foremost chemist fortunately air analysis much job apparatus carry 
nadia controlled impatience best could stevens manipulated bulbs pipettes gas apparatus 
pressure fifty two centimeters dared hope analysis x believe 
oxygen concentration little high much 
wear space suits unless missed something analysis 
pressure corresponds height three thousand meters get used without much trouble 
good thing 
brought along air could get hold told back depend altogether might luck 
going pump air back cylinder equalize pressure want waste sure outside air suits us without treatment 
pressure inside gradually reduced outside become accustomed breathing rarefied medium stevens opened airlock outside doors time cautiously sniffed atmosphere satellite 
could detect nothing harmful unusual apparently earthly air became jubilant 
x nadia luck perched right banner 
freedom air water power coal suggested go places things suppose safe first eagerness explore surroundings abated noticeably

matter steve looks like picture slow motion like kind take dives seeing things really slow compared used 
remember one half gravity stuff oh right certainly look funny 
gives creeps 
get used pretty quick get used rest things half earthly weight falling half fast ought drop 
well see anything looks dangerous yet let go toward falls meters prospect outcrop 
brisk strokes improvised shovel cleared outcrop detritus broke several samples black substance went back forlorn hope 
real coal stevens announced series tests

takes got nadia assured eyes sparkling 
job planned well fittingly mine 
got two methods getting away one get touch brandon come us recharge accumulators try make power 
either course need power lots never thought going back hope 
suppose could doubtful radio think could build pair matched frequency auto dirigible transmitter receptor units necessary space ships fed stationary power plants got built take us less half way 
power carry hate even think probably would happen us 
certainly drift months could get close enough plants radio help taking awful chances 
see take peculiar orbit miss connections passing inner planets sun would us closest point left us would go back swing would bad besides get hold sirius come loaded bear may able something rest folks 
oh breathed girl 
wonderful could thought course voice died away 
necessarily always chance 
trying ultra radio first 
however either course take lots power first thing got build power plant 
going run penstock falls put turbine driving high tension alternator 
trying build ultra radio charging accumulators time lost case radio fails 
fail remember counting working course tackle transmission receptor units start drift 
say easy steve build things nothing work going real job try kid thinking either easy quick 
way everything go 
even lay first length penstock got pipe make got flat steel get cut partitions ship cutting torch make forge nozzles block metal run gas get mine coal build gas plant good heavens steve going back stone age never thought half things 
impossible quite guy 
things could lot worse brought along whole forlorn hope instead lifeboat 
got several thousand tons spare steel lots copper 
got ordinary tools light motors blowers stuff 
gives great big start mine ores smelt metals would necessary otherwise 
however plenty bad 
start pretty crude fashion stuff need make machine makes part want also machine makes machine makes machine makes far line dared think 
must regular jack trades think get away program nothing else 
see school training advanced physics mathematics worked way computing designing done lot truck horse labor various kinds besides 
calculate design almost anything make pretty good stab translating design fabricated material 
wonder brandon ultra radio would stop since nobody even started build one saw last helped compute know forces involved well time happens know design coils fields force anything else 
may able work eventually 
going knowing hold lack something build 
go back back back said building penstock back back right find necessary raw materials probably going put lot monkey wrenches machinery 
stevens went work upon weapon offense fashioning crude powerful bow strip spring steel strung heavy wire 
arrows shall go see hit bird rock feathers see find something make arrows yet anyway bet birds going use pieces light brace rod accumulator cells arrows 
fly true course mass give enough projectile force kill small animal hit matter hit 
many misses finally bagged small animal something like rabbit something like kangaroo couple round bodied plump birds almost large domestic hens 
dressed considerable distaste noticeable lack skill 
get used pretty quick diana also expert said task done 
raw material bow strings clothes well food 
word raw heavily accented nadia declared grimace 
know good eat eat em see grinned 
imagine flesh really poisonous arrive ones like best process trial error 
well job get busy mine 
go hundred meters away yell get jam 
couple questions want ask 
makes warm sun far away jupiter supposed radiating heat time twelve hours watch since sunrise morning still shining 
heat wondering 
must due internal heat even though jupiter may warm even hot certainly radiating much since temperature minus two hundred visible surface course top atmosphere 
heat probably caused radioactivity modern dope believe 
time looks though days something better thirty hours long instead twenty four 
course keep chronometer going p time since probably need working observations might well let watches run work eat sleep sun much sense trying keep tellurian time see 
check x supper ready sunset

changed system today 
named things easier keep track like ones appetites sharp set long hours hard labor ate heartily deepening twilight sat talked comradely fashion stevens smoked one precious cigarette 
long nadia work well hand 
game plentiful fertile valley neighboring upland yielded peculiar savory vegetable foods variety abundance soon able spend time stevens helping much could 
thus came realize true magnitude task faced real seriousness position 
stevens admitted work started known set gigantic task permitted follow step step difficulties knew awaited 
days stretched weeks months forced take every laborious step borne upon nearly impossible herculean labor prove dependent given earthly activity upon vast number others 
alone everything needed must manufactured hands original sources 
known progress would slow prepared pictured even half maddening setbacks occurred time time crudity tools equipment forced use 
often machine part product many hours grueling labor would fail lack insignificant thing item common taken granted terrestrial shops impossible fabrication means disposal 
times would set grim jaw trifle harder go back one step farther toward stone age begin find necessary raw material possible substitute build apparatus machinery necessary produce part required 
thus heart breaking task progressed nadia watched co laborer become leaner harder desperate day day unable way lighten fearful load 
brief period rest following noonday meal stevens lay prone upon warm fragrant grass beside forlorn hope evident nadia resting

way back across foothills stevens shot another hexaped upon plateau river nadia bagged several birds small animals actually little canyon rapid pace slackened vigilance relaxed 
ace hunt together go back wearing armor hunting 
scared year growth checked missing 
sure steve concurred emphatically 
going get meter away 
suppose horrible things 
flowers like anything tellus ever saw basis comparison 
may development flycatching plant may link animal vegetable kingdom 
however intend study em let forget em 
animals undoubtedly intelligent beings probably race savages satellite 
really civilized races probably necessarily may well different types struggling toward civilization 
certainly venus mars 
seen anything like months things calm peaceful thought whole world far danger men concerned 
never saw never went lived long ways usual stamping grounds know 
animal vegetable flower probably high altitude organism living mountains never coming low 
savages whatever probably never come within five kilometers falls 
many primitive peoples think waterfalls inhabited demons maybe folks afflicted way 
know much new world yet sure particularly keen finding much get organized trouble either 
well like getting back home see hope home get one earth stevens read meters learning satisfaction full current still flowing accumulators began cut meat 
got power plant running last next asked nadia piling cuts freezer 
brandon ultra radio comes next got angles cubist picture set prisms many know begin 
job done let sit talk awhile 
maybe us figure start 
got everything build lined except tube got stopped cold 
see fields force right places got one tube got hardest possible vacuum 
means mercury vapor super pump 
mercury absolutely thing trick mercury one thing conspicuous absence parts 
tungsten filaments tantalum plates platinum leads found anything use getter either metal know flash inside tube clean last traces atmosphere 
suppose simple thing radio tube could hold perfectly unbelievable things done already see could 
course tubes receiver small yes receiver communicator tubes need high power transmitting tube fifty kilowatter least 
give left leg knee joint one big water cooled sixty kilowatt ten nineteens right would save us lot grief 
maybe could break tubes use plates thought work half enough metal lot filaments particular tiny possibly work big one 
got many spare tubes smash ones using put communicators business good yell help drift home still get mercury 
mean tell mercury whole planet exactly mean able find probably darned scarce 
since metals want worst also dense high atomic weight probably mighty scarce 
satellite matter hypothesis accept origin satellites come conclusion heavy metals either absent awfully scarce buried deep toward center 
lots heavy metals jupiter somewhere probably find 
jupiter atmosphere one mass fog see since got infra red transformer 
could build one time would take quite work jupiter anyway gravity probably atmosphere 
even could work want spend rest lives prospecting mercury 
stevens fell silent brow wrinkled thought 
mean dear nadia broke sentence unfinished 
gosh lots things tried yet always set drift 
thinking building tube 
trying think say nadia know cantrell comet thing except remember reading newspapers peculiar something 
cantrell comet got high cost living radio tubes gone cuckoo sudden surprised stevens grinned puzzled expression 
cantrell comet one jupiter comet family peculiar massive one known science 
hardly known built thousand foot reflectors moon seeing always perfect studied lot since

platinum everything else heavy girl ought quantity even volunteer chemist could find heavens steve look alarm flashed nadia face disappeared rapidly come 
course comets really dangerous 
sure 
comet tail many people afraid poison gas almost perfect vacuum even thickest wear space suits anyway 
speaking vacuum whoopee need mercury goldfish needs gas mask 
get mr tube done take space leaving mouth open shortly empty flapper skull 
seal flash come back start spilling troubles brandon shell like ear wonderful steve get idea occasionally get cantrell comet know exactly one rub 
another even started transmitter receptor units 
got field generators board use bad 
comet part solar system somewhere fairly close 
wish ephemeris couple p solar charts real telescope 
much without ephemeris think 
good thing kept chronometers going 
know p time day dates anyway 
without things man stared absently steel wall 
remember something orbit since one thing p vessels steer clear 
think figure close enough able find little telescope even plate since atmosphere 
might bad idea us get away anyway 
afraid folks space ship whoever must live around somewhere 
cantrell comet swings fifty million kilometers outside jupiter orbit aphelion close enough us reach yet probably far find us easily 
time get back probably quit looking us look 
expect savages follow us 
say little ace try stay know best steve 
said whatever think best 
know think best go 
therefore well said finally better get busy lot start 
radio come next transmitter receptor units come ahead 
mean wasted labor event since case radio fails 
better lay lot supplies working stuff go sight yell like fury see anything 
better wear full armor every time go doors unless control done savages yet

unthinkably ancient legends say titan extremely hot remote ancestors beings fire whose veins ran molten water instead blood 
since recorded history goes back tens thousands saturnian years since long period measurable change us us believed legends

vegetation died must bred plants ability use sap purely chemical liquids present natural fluids also may partly synthetic instead molten water accustomed 
must modified similarly outer atmosphere must made reactive compensate lowered temperature metabolism must take place 
titan grew colder colder probably dug cities deeper ever deeper humanity came finally realize must change completely perish utterly

many cycles ago however scientists developed rocket driven space ships explored neighboring satellites even saturn 
power plants upon saturn draw energy 
construction difficult extreme since pioneers work braces enormous force gravity 
protected overwhelming pressure poisonous qualities air insulated temperature far melting point water 
awful heat course customary building material water could employed instruments indicated saturn cold stevens interrupted 
surface temperature read afar would low conceded barkovis actual surface planet extremely hot highly volcanic 
practically none heat radiated great density depth atmosphere extends many hundreds kilometers 
required many thousands lives many years time build install automatic power plants operation assured power many tens thousands years come 
system power transmission less like anything like range 
suppose willing teach computation fields yes shall glad give formulae 
older race perhaps natural developed certain refinements yet unknown 
perceived detaining time rest goodbye barkovis wafted back toward mirrored globe 
make chemical solution blood steve asked nadia watching placidly floating form titanian captain 
much 
may mentioned one two perhaps even three men better chemists 
gathered something like polyhydric alcohol something like substituted hydrocarbon yet different either contains flourin loose combination 
think something tellurian chemists got yet got many organic compounds may synthesized 
see titan atmosphere nearly dense pure dynamite 
little oxygen mixed lot inert ingredients 
oxygen heavily laced flourin 
reactive fooling however something pretty violent must necessary carry body reactions temperature 
probably know even less kind thing 
funny way thinks water means ice always thinks real water molten reasonable enough think 
temperature differences logarithmic know arithmetic effective difference body temperature perhaps even greater melted iron 
never think iron liquid know 
right

glad sake well vessel able destroy hexan ship holding captive whose crew would killed soon landed vessel read minds 
regret bitterly little representatives human civilization exterminated race highly intelligent monsters fully realize desirable various races humanity assist support 
order may understand situation necessary delve length ancient history ample time 
broke realizing two races thought common measure time 
one half time rotation great planet upon axis flashed czuv brain five hours king mind flashed back 
five hours steps taken feel justified using brief period explanation 
evolution various forms life upon callisto two genera developed intelligence far ahead others 
one genus human hexan 
creature happily unknown planets nearer common sun product entirely different evolution 
six limbed animal brain equal one perhaps ways superior 
nothing common humanity however traits fewer mental processes 
even fought long scarcely comprehend chambers horror minds 
even able paint sufficiently vivid picture words earth could begin understand utter ruthlessness inhumanity even among 
would believe lying viewpoint warped 
say hope sincerely none ever get better acquainted 
ages ago human hexan developed upon four major satellites great planet know jupiter upon north polar region jupiter 
means two races came upon worlds widely separated space know know fact 
human life however could long endure upon jupiter 
various human races many attempts meet conditions life variations type fell hexans although small size upon planet thrived amazingly 
upon three outer satellites humanity triumphed many hundreds cycles ago hexans satellites wiped save occasional tribe savages low intelligence lived various undesirable portions three worlds 
ages peace upon callisto 
picture time upon jupiter hexans upon io hexans humans waging ceaseless relentless war mutual extermination upon three outer satellites humanity undisturbed unthreatened peace 
five worlds ignorant life upon 
said hexans jupiter diabolically intelligent 
driven probably desire see lay beyond atmosphere eternal cloud penetration eyesight attuned developed space ship effected safe landing first upon barren airless moonlet nearest upon fruitful io 
made common cause hexans humans space time ionian humanity ceased exist 
much traffic interbreeding followed hexans jupiter io resulting time race intermediate size parent stocks equally home widely variant air pressures gravities planet satellite 
soon astronomical instruments revealed cities europa gaze soon discovered civilization europa human destroyed utterly insatiable blood lust heritage 
meantime human civilizations ganymede callisto also developed instruments power 
observing cities upon satellites many scientists studied intensively problem space navigation finally commerce two outer satellites favorable times 
finally vessels also sent io europa none returned 
knowing expect ganymede callisto joined forces prepared war 
science long attuned arts peace fallen behind lamentably devising ever deadly instruments destruction 
ganymede fell fall read doom 
abandoning cities built anew underground 
profiting lessons learned full bloodily upon ganymede resolved prolong existence human race long possible

captain king pondered long able see one course action 
drifting constant velocity using power save vitally necessary machinery rest 
thus may hope avoid detection next two hours 
present course take us close europa hexans believe like ganymede entirely devoid civilized life 
original humanity totally destroyed civilized hexans finding shelter torpedoes upon jupiter callisto shall likewise annihilated

well south ecliptic traveling considerably full martian acceleration 
making suggestions like hear captain czuv familiar common enemy 
apt follow us detect us drift constant velocity search brains prisoners callistonian thought exchanger build one help close enough us overtake us without much lost time certainly attack us czuv answered nod newton 
ordinarily would pursue us limits solar system necessary since suffered reverses late spare vessels probably pursue us far 
yes detect us even without driving rays since vessel uses much low tension low frequency electricity automatic machinery lights 
thought transformer take thoughts force hexans exchange ideas us 
implacable deadly foes humanity irrespective planet race

captain czuv made headway asked director 
none whatever foretold 
understand thoroughly since two speak tongue nothing said ever repeated 
knew first attempts would fruitless tried failed 
suggest suggested first put death lie assuredly way contrive take toll lives humanity allow live 
may right said newton neither general give order death since interplanetary law countenance summary action 
however guards fully warned peril ray every prisoner first sign unruliness 
general crowninshield may remove prisoners deal accordance pandemonium reigned 
crowninshield signal guards leave room captives six strained furiously bonds three broken free flash throwing upon guards unthinkable ferocity

common consent meeting adjourned another room business hand could postponed 
captain czuv right tellurians could believe existence race without evidence senses 
newton reopened meeting 
time take prisoners 
doctor brandon may resume 
detectors lookouts give ample warning attack doctor westfall suggested possible facts hand try decide upon course action 
like hear full reports captain king captain czuv chief pilot breckenridge doctor stevens 
four men told stories tersely rapidly others listened deep attention 
last speaker sat newton turned brandon silently jerked head westfall knowing inadequacy situation realizing needed westfall cold methodical thinking 
director newton gentlemen westfall spoke calmly precisely 
much meet hexans upon equal terms 
many new fields force rays develop whose nature necessity doctor brandon already aware 
must recalculate visirays operate greater range efficiency 
must also examine hexan space ship towing desirable drift constant velocity time 
may find instruments devices yet unknown us 
also occurs since interplanetary police problem first magnitude get touch police headquarters peace fleet armed shall armed large highly efficient fleet necessary must done 
course foregone conclusion interplanetary humanity support humanity callisto hexans 
also self evident must stay rescue tellurians upon europa callisto yet position decide rescue accomplished 
four courses apparently open us 
first attempt soon shall strengthened armament much possible 
would invite massed attack opinion would foolish probably suicidal 
second stand distance rocket ship launched escort back earth 
third aid callistonians much possible awaiting completion rocket vessel 
fourth perhaps feasible quickest may possible callistonian rocket ships bring fellow tellurians time us space since apparently able come go 
however would recommend make plans rescue yet little use attempting deal ever changing situation ready act forthwith 
suggest strengthen offensive defensive armament first secure information exact status affairs upon callisto upon europa 
ready act whatever seems called situation obtaining 
program outlined seems eminently sensible 
comments suggestions none offered director newton adjourned meeting man attacked particular problem 
true czuv prediction hexans deem worthwhile pursue terrestrial vessel obviously earnestly fleeing shortly acceleration cut render possible thorough study two halves spherical warship enemy 
scientists donned space suits studied every feature strange vessel mechanics dismantled transferred sirius every device instrument interest 
one two novel useful applications rays forces found visirays communicators particular high degree efficiency upon whole science hexans found inferior known scientists interplanetary flying laboratory 
brandon studied hexan power system carefully everything readiness long talk westfall called general conference control room 
gentlemen done everything time 
combining best features visirays communicators hexans newly perfected devices really excellent system communication 
friends mars venus altered enlarged force controls offensive defensive fields rays screens leave little desired 
power far ahead enemy 
apparently know nothing possibilities cosmic radiation depend upon tight beam transmission power plants transmission perfected point far beyond anything reached us three planets 
use accumulators therefore dissipation limited maximum reception seventy thousand kilofranks 
since dissipate ten times amount energy could withstand short time simultaneous attacks ten vessels 
eleven however would able crush defensive screens captain czuv seen many hundred space ships one formation 
furthermore since several times maximum acceleration could concentrate quickly upon desired point 
could escape flight really set overtake us certainly venture territory 
therefore clear subject attack force follows much anything police fleet five hundred vessels armed join us near callisto 
require several months best 
already know decided return minor planets might invite hexan attack upon police fleet yet unprepared 
heading uranus hope course distract attention hexans tellus even though probably already know tellurians 
new communicator ray reach member jovian system point 
decided safe use since employs almost absolutely tight beam small diameter since know one hexan vessel least apparatus sufficiently sensitive detect beam nature 
therefore get touch callistonians people 
brandon seated communicator screen others packed closely around stool snapped visiray turned dials directed invisible immensely complex beam space

frowning thought turned newton spoke seriously slowly 
immediately loss super plane supposed death king breckenridge tellurian officers returned europa since even could assistance us callistonians struggle new high acceleration vessels hexans 
present situation much serious would believed possible 
last vessel going visit wruszk city upon europa caught destroyed hexans many weeks ship message come callisto 
spite fact hexan fleet smaller ever guarding europa closely 
feared may found destroyed city expedition even set desperate attempt learn fate fellows 
suppose rays lifeboats detected landing asked brandon 
might given clue 
possibly equally possible men became careless operation one vessels 
unmolested long might relaxed vigilance 
may never know 
tell em cancel expedition shoot visiray right find 
let know pretty quickly 
also might tell got complete plans specifications weapons hexans couple besides quicker shoot ship sooner get building stuff blow hexans clear space work moments drive visiray projection europa czuv great relief found hexans yet discovered either wruszk terrestrial workings

penfield reported work upon great rocket ship progressing satisfactorily although slowly since much larger vessel theretofore constructed callistonians 
newton turn informed autocrat stranded terrestrials status quo rescuing party

well cured trouble personnel king broke sharply

four us huh come demanded brandon astonishment 
four babies born us far several coming 
ones worried 
normal adults stand without serious effects thin atmosphere weak gravity certain result abnormal development children 
however may another way 
using normal acceleration martians aboard replied brandon 
carrying two inhabitants mars alcantro fedanzo ordinary martians 
constant training ever since left tellus stand high acceleration weak tellurian 
riding normal 
good already know communication late callisto 
already decided however one voyage must risked order bring back material urgently needed 
since vessel leave light large enough carry thirty passengers short trip crowding council probably approve carry passengers sirius especially since vessel must visit anyway get captain czuv specifications new armament 
things done one vessel one trip 
sounds fine boomed king

kenor right 
stevens spoke calculator 
getting far ahead situation 
apt keep ahead long enough much leading anywhere 
titanians hold beam together saturn jupiter snake folks several reasons brandon argued stubbornly 
first place look mass thing remember heavier beam harder hold together 
second evidence wander around much space 
beams designed principally travel upon jupiter extraordinary range say hold beam forever 
got good long lead spite higher acceleration think able keep range heavy stuff

assured real danger sirius presence longer necessary brandon turned controls assistant went venerian rooms von steiffel staff operate upon vorkul 
dense hot air little different atmosphere jupiter kromodeor lay bolted solid steel floor means padded steel straps 
heavy bands could possibly break even one closely spaced could scarcely moved muscle tried 
try near death mighty muscles even quiver trenchant bite surgeon tools 
von steiffel aides meticulously covered sterile gowns hoods gloves worked rigidly aseptic style deftly rapidly closing ghastly wounds inflicted weapons hexans 
hi brandon surgeon grunted straightened work completed 
use much antiseptic 
possible differences blood chemistry ignorance native bacteria depended almost wholly upon asepsis natural resistance 
good thing use anesthetic 
bad shape feed successfully may pull 
feed never thought 
suppose eats idea something highly concentrated anatomy 
shall try giving sugar milk chocolate something kind 
first shall try maple syrup 
liquid easily administered penetrating odor also may help 
liquid brought amazement terrestrials long delicate antennae vorkul began twitch soon opened 
motioning hastily silence von steiffel filled bowl placed upon floor beneath kromodeor grotesque nose 
twitching increased finally one dull glazed eye brightened somewhat curled slowly upon slender pedicle toward dish 
mouth opened sluggishly long red tongue reached perceptions quickened became conscious strangers near 
mouth snapped shut eye retracted heaving rippling surges traversed powerful body struggled madly unbreakable shackles steel binding floor 
ach kindlein surgeon bent anxiously grotesque frightened head soothing polysyllabic german crooning bearded lips 
let try good stevens suggested bringing callistonian thought exchanger 
three men donned headsets sent wave wave friendly soothing thoughts toward frantic terrified brain 
got brain shut like clam brandon snorted 
open guy going hurt best friends got knew himmel und iss killing moaned von steiffel 
one chance might work brandon stepped communicator demanding verna pickering brought 
came soon air locks would permit physicist welcomed eagerly 
fellow fighting tearing pieces 
make receive thought von steiffel afraid use anesthetic 
barely possible may understand hexan 
thought wasted time learning maybe see make understand friends 
girl flinched shrank back involuntarily forced approach awful head 
bending repeated one harsh barking syllable 
effect word magical 
instantly kromodeor ceased struggling eye curled long supple tongue flashed syrup 
last sticky trace licked bowl attention wander food 
eye sparkling brightly raised toward girl 
simultaneously four eyes arose one directed men surveying bonds room 
vorkul spoke whistling hissing manner speech garbled barking sounds hexan words attempting utter verna slight knowledge language use 
therefore put one headsets motioning men approached kromodeor repeating hexan word friendly import 
time vorkul brain sealed visitors thoughts began flow 
used things lot brandon turned stevens quick aside 
hide thoughts sure think power system know going sure 
better getting anyway 
wipe mind clear conscience rest us get everything got 
job get everything bird brain 
x x put verna exclaimed 
think time 
get started talking got lot work 
steve talk see later brandon gone 
went directly vorkulian fortress bare hexan life devoid hexan snares traps 
fellows labored day day learning every secret every item armament equipment aboard heptagon 
finish today norm asked stevens one evening 
kromodeor coming life fast 
able wiggle around little insisting take one chain keep let use plate call people 
washed 
guess go talk say egg 
stuff mind hide well enough 
way eat two friends set venerian rooms 
anything sweet apparently enough milk furnish little protein 
eat meat vegetables von steiffel says got much digestive tract know got teeth 
already eaten syrup board milk chocolate lot sugar 
none us get kind raise even nadia fed whole box chocolates 
mean eat home seems sort syrup made juices jungle plants drag automatic conveyors process automatic machinery 
funny mutt hard get 
thoughts lucid enough others make foreign human nature simply register thoughts 
one funny thing least bit curious anything 
want examine anything ask us questions tell us anything anything know found purely accident 
instance like games sports seem families 
also love liking respect others race seem emotions whatever outsiders 
utterly inhuman describe get 
find callistonians went see negatively yes 
never arrived 
probably see fog must missed city 
tried land jungle bad would account everything 
strictly neutral eh well tell hi anyway 
sickroom brandon picked headset sent wave cheery greeting 
amazement mind vorkul utterly unresponsive thoughts 
disdainful inimical appreciative friendly simply indifferent degree unknown incomprehensible human mind 
sent brandon one message came clear coldly emotionless 
want talk 
tell hairy doctor strong enough allowed go communicator screen 

vorkul mind became oblivious maze unintelligible thoughts 
deliberately kromodeor thoughts hidden constitutionally unable interest thoughts things alien intelligence 
well 
puzzled thoughtful look came brandon face called von steiffel 
queer duck ever one 
however ship never bother us one good thing think got everything want anyway 
surgeon careful examination patient unlocked heavy collar restraining anxious vorkul supported lightly communicator panel 
surely though used controls years kromodeor shot visiray beam space 
one hand upon several dials one eye upon meter matter seconds get touch vorkulia 
terrestrials screen gray foggy blank manifest excitement shrieking whistling speaker response kromodeor signals made plain message received enthusiasm 
coming vorkul thought lay back exhausted 
well comin brandon commented 
begin handle structure anywhere near jupiter fact want get close passengers aboard 
power vorkulian vessels less twenty hours another heptagon slowed halt beside sirius two crew wafted aboard 
ushered venerian room talked briefly wounded fellow dressed space suit filled air pressure 
three lifted lightly air without word sign borne air locks vessel opening wall rescuing heptagon 
green tractor beam reached seizing derelict structures darted away pace minutes disappeared black depths space 
well may remarked indisputably conclusively 
brandon broke surprised almost stunned silence followed unceremonious departure visitors

hi men nadia stevens verna pickering arms around waists entered room saluted group gaily became part 
smatter girls tired dancing already asked brandon 
oh could dance verna assured 
see nadia seen husband fifteen minutes getting lonesome 
afraid men wanted come along moral support 
real reason came though narrowed expressive eyes lowered voice mysteriously two physicists 
want study chosen victims little longer decide cast spell fatal charm 
objected vigorously 
quince going settle day shooting dice maybe broke listening animated conversation going behind 
simply outrageous nadia exclaiming 
saved life fed lot candy went trouble bringing ship back almost jupiter simply dashed without word thanks anything always acted though never wanted see hear us ever think straight norman would say full little red ants even human sure 
brandon turned flushed speaker 
hardly make 
absolutely necessary intelligent beings possess emotion gratitude without seem funny us see lack necessarily implies anything particularly important 
keep still minute went nadia tried interrupt listen real wisdom 
quince tell em 
course highly developed extremely intelligent surprising intelligence manifest ways quite baffling us human beings whose minds work differently 
however well peculiar 
keep still nadia burst first opportunity 
want talk hideous things anyway 
come steve let go dance crowninshield turned verna obvious intention leading away brandon interposed 
sorry crown lady conducting highly important psychological research purely social claims wait scientific work done 
narrow field investigation laughed girl 
rather widen might prefer general even physicist went main saloon joined l e one dance verna could claim crowd men crowninshield turned brandon 
two seem know miss pickering extraordinarily well 
would stepping toes give play clear ether far concerned
