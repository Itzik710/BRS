slone left outfit except saddle sack containing pounds meat supplies two utensils 
sack tied back saddle resumed journey 
presently came place wildfire doubled trail turned side canyon 
climb hard slone nagger 
slone found upon wide barren plateau glaring red rock clumps greasewood cactus 
plateau miles wide shut great walls mesas colored rock 
afternoon sun beat fiercely 
blast wind furnace swept across plateau laden red dust 
slone walked could ridden 
made several miles progress rough plateau 
great walls opposite side canyon loomed appreciably closer 
slone wondered bottom rent earth great desert river course knew nothing 
would turn back wildfire slone thought grimly always claimed nagger part fish part bird 
wildfire going escape 
isolated mescal plants long yellow plumed spears broke bare monotony plateau 
slone passed red sand gravel red soft shale hard red rock 
wildfire tracks lost first time seven weeks 
slone direction plateau cleavage lines canyons right left 
times slone found vestige old indian trail made doubly sure right 
need wildfire tracks 
let nagger pick way horse made mistake finding line least resistance 
grew harder harder 
bare rock like file would soon wear wildfire hoofs thin 
slone rejoiced 
perhaps somewhere awful chasm nagger would stallion 
slone began look far ahead beginning believe might see wildfire 
twice seen wildfire distance 
resembled running streak fire whence name slone given 
bare region rock began cut gullies 
necessary head climb 
miles travel really meant little progress straight ahead 
slone kept 
hot nagger hot made hard work easier 
sometimes wind came low thunder 
storm avalanche slipping falling water could tell 
sound significant haunting 
one thing sure could found back trail 
divined never retrace steps journey 
stretch broken plateau grew wilder bolder outline darker color weirder aspect progress across grew slower dangerous 
many places nagger put slip meant broken leg 
slone could turn back 
something besides indomitable spirit kept going 
sound resembling thunder assailed ears louder time 
plateau appeared ending series great capes promontories 
slone feared would soon come upon promontory might see impossibility travel 
felt relieved gullies could see far 
climbed one presently extended narrow ledge slant perilous horse 
stepped upon far less confidence nagger 
right bulge low wall feet left dark precipice

slone drew deep breath relief led nagger level rock 
suddenly strange yet familiar sound halted slone struck 
wild shrill high pitched piercing whistle stallion nagger neighed blast reply pounded rock iron shod hoofs

nagger stamped snorted defiance slone looked fixed keen gaze knew beautiful picture lie 
wildfire red fire 
long mane wild wind like whipping black streaked flame 
silhouetted canyon background seemed gigantic demon horse ready plunge fiery depths 
looking back shoulder head high every line instinct wildness 
sent shrill air splitting whistle 
slone understood clarion call nagger 
nagger alone wildfire would killed 
red stallion killer horses

wildfire sunk deep reaching edge

slone found better place waded urging nagger 
big horse plunged almost going began swim 
slone kept stream beside 
found presently water thick made tired necessary grasp stirrup towed 
river appeared hundred feet wide probably wider looked 
nagger labored heavily near opposite shore still landed safely upon rocky bank 
patches sand wildfire tracks showed fresh water yet dried 
slone rested horse attempting climb split rock 
however wildfire found easy ascent

clear trail led dusty gravelly slope upon scant greasewood cactus appeared 
half hour climbing brought slone could see entering vast valley sloping narrowing notch dark cliffs towered great red wall slopes cedar yellow rim rock

monotonous toil slone forgot zest pursuit 
nagger suddenly snorted fright slone prepared saw

slone thought horse could express hate surely wildfire 
certain express curiosity fury 
slone shook gantleted fist stallion horse human 
natural action rider kind 
wildfire turned away showed bright dark background disappeared 
chapter vi last slone saw wildfire three days 
took day climb canyon 
second slow march thirty miles scrub cedar pinyon forest great red yellow walls canyon could seen 
night slone found water hole rocky pocket little grass nagger 
third day travel consisted forty miles level pine forest dry odorous lacking freshness beauty forest north side canyon 
south side strange feature water ran away rim 
slone camped night muddy pond woods wildfire tracks showed plainly 
following day slone rode forest country scanty cedars bleached stunted edge plateau shimmering desert flung vast desolate distances forbidding menacing 
desert upland country utah naked bony world colored rock sand painted desert heat wind flying sand waterless wastes barren ranges 
daunt slone 
far bare billowing ridges moved red speck snail pace slowly moving dot color wildfire 
open ground like nagger carrying two hundred fifty pounds showed wonderful quality 
mind heat sand glare distance burden 
tire 
engine tremendous power 
slone gained upon wildfire toward evening day reached within half mile stallion 
chose keep far behind 
night camped dry grass water 
next day followed wildfire endless swell rolling red ridges bare bleached white grass meager greasewood always descending face painted desert bold ragged steps 
slone made fifty miles day gained valley bed slender stream ran thin spread wide sandy bottom 
salty water welcome man beast 
following day crossed tracks wildfire still wet sand bars 
stallion slowing 
slone saw limping along far advance 
ten mile stretch level ground blown hard rock sustenance bleached spear grass grew 
following tortuous passage weird region clay dunes blue violet heliotrope lavender worn smooth rain wind 
wildfire favored soft ground 
deviated straight course 
partial washes dips earth water might lodged 
scornful green scummed water hole white margin alkali 
night slone made camp wildfire plain sight 
stallion stopped pursuers stopped 
began graze stretch nagger 
strange seemed slone camp evidence indians 
wildfire swung round north course 
like pursued wild animal began circle 
pointed nose toward utah left 
next morning wildfire sight left tracks sand 
slone trailed nagger trot 
toward head sandy flat slone came upon old corn fields broken dam water stored well defined trails leading away right 
somewhere desert lived indians 
point wildfire abandoned trail followed many days cut north 
took morning hours climb three great steps benches led summit mesa vast extent 
turned sandy waste 
wind rose everywhere moving sheets sand distance circular yellow dust devils rising high like waterspouts back sun scorched valley sandstorm moved along majestically burying desert yellow pall 
two days sand another day slowly rising ground growing bare gray gray green purple sage cedar three grinding days toiled one water hole 
wildfire lame distress nagger growing gaunt showing strain slone haggard black worn plodded miles miles foot save horse 
slone felt would futile put chase test speed 
nagger could never head stallion 
slone meant go always pushing wildfire keeping tired wearied worrying till section country reached could drive wildfire kind natural trap 
pursuit seemed endless 
wildfire kept open country could surprised 
came morning slone climbed cedared plateau rose whole day travel split labyrinthine maze canyons 
trees grass water 
high country cool wild like uplands left 
days camped wildfire trail always relentlessly driving always watching trap hoped find 
red stallion spent much time flight looking backward 
whenever slone came sight head shoulder watching 
soft ground canyons begun recover lameness 
worry slone 
sooner later wildfire would go high walled wash would outlet would wander box canyon would climb mesa place descend unless passed slone would get cornered soft steep slope hoofs would sink deep make slow 
nature desert changed 
slone entered wonderful region like seen high plateau crisscrossed every direction narrow canyons red walls thousand feet high 
one strange turning canyons opened vast valley monuments 
plateau weathered washed away leaving huge sections stone walls standing isolated different size shape clean cut bold straight lines

still alter slone purpose though lost joy former hopes 
rode slope upon billowing floor valley 
wildfire looked back see pursuers solemn stillness broke wild piercing whistle 
day day camping night found slone followed stallion never losing sight till darkness fallen 
valley immense monuments miles apart 
always seemed close together near 
air magnified everything 
slone lost track time 
strange solemn lonely days silent lonely nights endless pursuit wild weird valley completed work years slone became satisfied unthinking almost savage 
toil privation worn like iron 
garments hung tatters boots ripped soleless 
long since flour used supplies except salt

knew would starve 
many times within rifle shot wildfire 
grim forbidding thought grew upon must kill stallion 
thought seemed involuntary mind rejected 
nevertheless knew could catch stallion would kill 
end many desperate rider pursuit coveted horse 
slone kept merciless pursuit never letting wildfire rest day time went relentlessly 
spring gave way early summer 
hot sun bleached grass water holes failed valley water could found canyons dry winds began blow sand 
sandy valley green gray distance toward north monuments slow heave sand lifted toward dim walls 
wildfire worked away open valley back south end great monuments loomed still farther back grew closer till length joined weathered ridges walls surrounding plateau 
slone could see wildfire perfect condition 
nagger horse 
slone realized one way another pursuit narrowing end 
found water hole head wash split walls let nagger rest graze one whole day first day long time kept red stallion sight 
day marked good fortune killing rabbit eating gloomy fixed mind admitted starving 
dreaded next sunrise 
could hold back 
behind dark monuments standing sentinel like sky lightened reddened burst gold pink till golden glare sun rose glorious 
slone facing league long shadows monuments rode silent solemn day hopeless quest 
change wildfire climbed high slope talus narrow pass rounded drifting sand 
slone gazed huge amphitheater full monuments like strange country 
basin three miles across lay beneath 
walls weathered slants rock steep slopes reddish yellow sand inclosed oval depression

crossed small areas grass different parts region 
wildfire tracks led basin presently slone straining eyes made red spot stallion 
lookin quit country soliloquized slone surveyed scene

day passed slowly hot 
heat waves rose dark wavering lines veils valley

word favorite one riders slone used call menace stallion express feeling blaze already running wild 
without looking back slone rode across valley dropping glowing stick every quarter mile 
reached side dozen fires behind burning slowly white smoke rising lazily 
loped nagger along side back sandy ascent mouth pass

watched lines perceptibly lengthened brightened pale shadows smoke began appear 
left valley two brightest fires first started crept closer closer together 
seemed long covering distance 
breath wind stirred besides really might move swiftly without looking slone 
two lines met sudden larger blaze rose 
ah said rider watched lines creeping together 
slowly fire moved thought 
red stallion would every chance run lines dared 
wild horse feared nothing like fire 
one would run gantlet flames 
nevertheless slone felt relieved lines closed 
hours night dragged past length one long continuous line fire spread level across valley bright red line broken monuments stone silhouetted

wild stallion kept center valley restlessly facing way never toward smoke 
slone made sure wildfire gradually gave ground line smoke slowly worked toward

slone took direction trail saw low dark notch rocky wall distance 
paid attention choosing good ground wildfire trail 
stallion tractable slone ever found 
loved open 
smelled sage wild 
settled long easy swinging lope seemed eat miles 
slone obsessed thoughts centering round lucy time distance scarcely significant 
sun dipped full red golden west slone reached wall rocks cleft creech tracks lucy marked camp 
slone even dismount 
riding cleft wound length canyon larger one found lucy remembered leave trail break high wall another winding canyon 
sun set slone kept long could see trail intersecting canyon made wise halt 
rich grass sweet water horse 
hungry ate sleepy slept 
daylight found urging wildfire pursuit 
rocky places slone found cedar berries lucy dropped 
welcomed sight need 
man creech could never hide trail slone thought grimly suited follow trail rapid trot 
lost tracks distance went right knew look ahead 
vast difference cunning creech cunning wild horse 
equal difference going staying powers creech mustangs wildfire 
yes slone divined lucy salvation would wildfire horse 
trail grew rougher steeper harder stallion kept eagerness pace 
many open length canyon height wild upland slone gazed ahead hoping see creech mustangs 
hoped even knew still far behind 
suddenly open sandy flat intersecting canyon came abruptly fresh trail three horses one shod 
surprise stunned 
moment gazed stupidly strange tracks 
made creech met allies likely man friends pondering thing slone went slowly realizing new disturbing feature confronted 
new tracks met trail creech left slone found strangers interested creech tracks 
slone found boot marks sand hand prints one knelt scrutinize creech trail 
slone led horse walked disturbed mind 
came larger bare flat canyon bottom rock washed clear sand found cedar berries 
picked 
extreme edge stony ground found crumpled bits cedar cedar berries scattered one spot thrown one read meaning 
discovery unnerved slone

slone hope reason doubt strangers taken trail good next miles dispelled 
trailing creech 
suddenly slone gave wild start made wildfire plunge 
cordts whispered slone cold sweat oozed every pore 
canyons hiding places horse thief 
two men chanced upon creech trail perhaps guess meaning like slone guessed would soon learn 
magnified slone task thousandfold 
moment bitter almost hopeless realization desperate spirit awoke 
men kill 
upland riders pack rifles slone sure 
sooner came cordts better 
let wildfire choose gait trail 
sunset twilight dusk darkness came slone keeping 
long intersecting canyons clefts slopes creech might swerved course long slone would travel 
late night halt 
early next day trail led red broken gulches cedared uplands 
slone saw black rimmed looming plateau distance 
winding canyons necks high ridges must run great table land 
day lost two horse tracks 
mark change long time split party trailing creech 
late go back investigate even wise 
kept pondering trying decide whether discovered danger ambush ahead pursuit behind 
thought possibly cordts split party one trail along creech others work around head 
undoubtedly cordts knew broken canyon country could tell creech going knew intercept 
uncertainty wore heavily upon slone 
grew desperate 
time steal along cautiously 
must first get creech 
held trail went rapidly nature ground would permit expecting shot clump cedars 
trail led narrow canyon low walls 
slone put keenness lay 
wildfire sudden break upflinging head snort preceded crack rifle 
slone knew shot although neither felt heard bullet 
chance see shot came wildfire bolted needed much holding guiding slone could give 
ran mile 
slone able look 
shot behind could tell 
matter long danger front 
kept sharp lookout presently along right canyon rim five hundred feet saw bay horse rider rifle 
wrong riders weapons 
slone see wisdom halting shoot pursuer spurred wildfire sharp crack sounded 
bullet thudded earth feet behind 
bad ground stallion almost unmanageable slone ran gantlet shots 
evidently man rim smooth ground ride easily kept abreast slone 
could get range 
fortunately slone broken ramparts checked tricks pursuer slone saw 
afforded great relief find creech trail turned canyon left sun already low slone began watch clumps cedars jumbles rock 
ambushed 
darkness set tired halt night caught flicker campfire 
stallion saw snort 
slone dismounted leading went cautiously forward foot rifle hand 
canyon widened point two breaks occurred less restricted space thick cedar pinyon 
slone could tell presence trees also keener atmosphere slowly getting higher attitude 
camp fire must belong cordts one man gone ahead 
slone advanced boldly 
make mind 
amazed see several dark forms moving fro bright camp fire checked abruptly 
considering moment slone thought better look fellows 
tied wildfire taking darker side canyon stole cautiously forward 
distance considerable calculated 
soon however made shadowy outlines horses feeding open 
hugged canyon wall fear might see 
luck would night breeze favor 
stealthily stole deep shadow wall cedars came point opposite camp fire turned toward 
went slowly carefully noiselessly last crawled narrow aisles thick sage brush 
another clump cedars loomed saw flickering firelight upon pale green foliage 
heard gruff voices raised look gauged distance 
close enough almost close

rode canyon sloping walls broken like canyons great plateau 
every canyon resembled another 
upland one vast network 
world seemed labyrinth canyons among hopelessly lost 
would become lucy every thought whirling brain led back terrible 
gazing transfixed upon familiar tracks left creech mustangs 
days old still unfollowed chapter xix track led narrowing canyon head base plateau 
slone mindful horse climbed foot halting zigzag turns rest 
long gradually ascending trail mounted last slope close hand precipitous appeared 
wind sucked canyons swooped twisted hard 
last slone led wildfire rim halted another breathing spell 
beautiful gently sloping stretch waving grass leading dark pine forest came roar wind 
beneath slone wild whorled canyon breaks extended wonderful thousands denuded surfaces gold red yellow smoky depths 
wildfire sniffed wind snorted 
slone turned instantly alert 
wild horse given alarm 
like flash slone leaped saddle 
faint cry away wind startled slone 
like cry heard dreams 
overstrained perceptions really sure anything yet instant tense 
straggling cedars left almost wholly obstructed slone view 
wildfire ears nose pointed way 
slone trotted toward edge cedar clump could see beyond

ears hurt growing deaf 
tumult rear avalanches maelstroms rushing seas wreck uplands
