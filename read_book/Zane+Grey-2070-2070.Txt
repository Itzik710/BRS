shock convulsion pain relaxation unutterable insupportable sensing environment heart one way wild animal alone woods forced mating meant reproduction kind 
another infinitely higher shot resistless mysterious transport life could give flesh 
spell slackened hold wedged mind consciousness man loved jean isbel 
emotion thought strove mastery 
love loved living man 
suddenly existed clearly could see hear almost feel 
whole soul life cried protection salvation love fulfillment 
denial doubt marred white blaze realization 
instant looked jean isbel dark face loved 
known 
bowed bent humbly quivered mastery something beyond ken 
thought clung beginnings romance three times seen 
every look every word every act returned light truth 
love first sight sworn bitterly eloquently scornful doubts 
blind sweet shuddering ecstasy swayed 
weak frail seemed body small slight monstrous terrible engine fire lightning fury glory heart must burst break 
relentlessly memory pursued ellen thoughts whirled emotion conquered 
last quivered knees lashed action 
seemed first kiss isbel cool gentle timid lips 
eyes closed hot tears welled lids 
groping hands found dead twigs pine boughs trees 
reached clasp hard violent mouth cheek neck burned kisses isbel flashing stinging memory came truth would bartered soul 
utterly surrendered resistlessness love

overthrew pride engendered humility killed hate 
ellen wiped tears eyes knelt swept breast fragrant spreading bough pine needles 
go whispered

jean isbel given sight deference unconsciously craved love would salvation 
horrible mistake made life mother blood father jorth blood ruin 
ellen fell upon soft pine needle mat face groveled burrowed agony could bear sense light 
suffered nothing 
awakened splendid uplifting love man imagined hated fought name killed revenge dishonor avowed lost love infinitely precious ignominy faith purity broke heart

progress possible endless detours find half closed aisles patches else crashing main strength walking right tops 
jean preferred last method easiest reason could see ahead much farther 
literally walked across tips manzanita brush

slowly surely followed dusty hot trail never patch blood failed send thrill along veins 
queen headed toward rim finally vanished sight 
fallen hiding hour disclosed crawling 
jean keen eye caught slow moving brush enabled keep close rustler range six shooters carried 
interminable hours hot afternoon snail pace flight pursuit kept 
halfway rim growth manzanita gave place open yellow rocky slope dotted cedars 
queen took slow ascending ridge left bloody tracks way top gathering darkness weary pursuer lost 
another night passed

somehow desperate last rally strength reached point heavily timbered ridge jean recognized near scene fight canyon 
queen nearing rendezvous rustlers 
jean crossed tracks horses tracks certain made days past party
