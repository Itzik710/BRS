good night 
yessir good night sir number sir first floor left hand side 
number slammed door degree violence indicates stout arm easy conscience 
less quarter hour keen gray eyes veiled slumber proved unmistakably household sounds proceeded nose eyes belonged 
unfrequently found strength mind vigor body high color tremendous appetite associated great capacity snoring 
man keen gray eyes possessed qualities well large chin firm mouth full strong white teeth

half past nine precisely number entered coffee room closely followed waiter breakfast seemed self sacrificing functionary sat night keeping meal hot order testify excessive punctuality devotion soul duty 
keen eyed man keen appetite one might judge appearances matter 
thick underdone steak overwhelmed plate appeared melt away rapidly 
potatoes disposed two bites small ones immolated whole 
mustard used much might made small sized plaster pepper sowed broadcast made account whatever salt sugar nothing 
peculiar crash sound produced biting toast suggestive irresistible power thorough disintegration 
coffee went half cup gulps shrimps disappeared shoals shells short proceedings might explained intelligent observer many men grow exceedingly fat hotel proprietors afford lower apparently exorbitant charges 
waiter standing modestly looking solemn interest mentally attributed traveller extraordinary powers high health fact neither smoked drank 
would presumptuous us hazard speculation subject face opinion held one thoroughly competent judge 
breakfast keen eyed man put hat overcoat sallied forth harbor spent greater part forenoon loitering inspecting boats particularly lifeboat shipping much interest entering conversation boatmen lounged upon pier 
gracious coxswain lifeboat bluff deep chested hearty neck nothing sort man intelligent eye almost keen manner quite prompt 
coxswain conversed long nature stirring dangerous duties 
made inquiry crew many men circumstances way whether happened named jones 
one named coxswain said tom jones 
led traveller ask tom jones owned small sloop 
sloop even boat 
jones town owned small sloop dealt largely cured fish yes regular gallow bird reports true coxswain told 
traveller press subject long

nevertheless gained information jones desired hiring boat set floating light 
weather appeared threatening night suddenly became calm fine corroborate statement waiter fortress hotel regard uncertainty knowing men oilcloth sou westers long boots gave opinion weather trusted 
fortunately traveller remained trustworthy long enough serve purpose 
calm permitted boat go safely alongside light ship climb side without difficulty 
vessel found means style clipper built quite reverse 
short length bluff bows round stern painted excepting mast deck bright red color like great scarlet dragon gigantic boiled lobster 
might mistaken first attempt ship building way infatuated boy whose acquaintance ships founded hearsay whose taste color violently eccentric 
remarkable thing one immense mast middle supported six stays like norse galleys old yards although sea indeed home incessantly braved fury storm diurnally cleft waters flood ebb tide gallantly breasted billows ocean year round need sails 
never advanced inch course course 
never made port 
never either homeward outward bound 
streaming eyes ever watched departure beating hearts ever hailed return 
bowsprit never pointed either greenland icy mountains india coral strand bowsprit 
helm never swayed port starboard although helm vessel turned submissive tides rudder lashed hard fast amidships like weather cocks move 
doom tug perpetually day night year year gigantic anchor would let go strain monster chain cable would snap short strive ever like sisyphus something never attained 
sad destiny may tempted exclaim 
reader sad appears 
presented one side picture 
curious almost ridiculous looking craft among aristocracy shipping 
important office stamped nobility 
lay conspicuous royal color day day year year mark fair way white cliffs old england outlying shoals distinguished daylight huge ball mast head night magnificent lantern argand lamps concave reflectors shot rays like lightning far wide watery waste thick weather neither ball light could discerned sonorous gong gave deep toned warning approaching mariner let know position amid surrounding dangers 
without warnings night day world would suffer loss thousands lives untold millions gold 
indeed mere absence warnings one stormy night would certainly result loss irreparable life property 
well might great britain dispense armies floating lights boiled lobster like craft also may allowed say stamped magnanimity services disinterested universal 
ships sailing grandly ports canvas panoply swelling pride costly merchandise within unmindful ship remained floating destitute cargo either rich poor never port always service serene majesty one settled self sacrificing purpose guide converging navies world safely past dangerous shoals meet passage world greatest port thames speed safely thence outward bound 
unclipperly craft moreover gallant vessel post one danger 
ships fled wings terror storm trysails seek refuge harbor roadstead one merely lengthened cable knight might shake loose reins war horse eve conflict calmly awaited issue prepared let storm worst meet bold front

may added jack shales unquestionably noisiest man board 
good voice could sing sing morning till night power uttering yell would put shame wildest warrior among cherokee savages jack shales kept watch moy night assisted conversation sudden snow storm induced young welton bid good night retire 
good night said shales jim head disappearing hatchway stir fire keep warm

wreck sand fear muttered dick moy putting hands guard eyes snow flakes driven wildly wind time increased furious gale 
minutes two men stood gazing intently towards south west horizon 
presently faint flash seen faint could certain signal gun 
minutes however thin thread red light seen curve upwards black sky 
mistake cried jack leaping towards cabin skylight threw bending shouted south sandhead light firing sir sending rockets mate moment land dreams sprang bunk stood cabin floor almost sentence finished 
son drawn blanket shoulders given vent first sigh contentment man usually lays head pillow night also jumped drew coat nether garments shoes life depended speed dashed deck 
unusual need clothing night become bitterly cold coat ice formed even salt water spray blown boats 
found dick moy jack shales already actively engaged one loading lee gun adjusting rocket stick 
hurried questions mate elicited needful know 
flash gun south sandhead lightship six miles distinctly seen third time third rocket went welton son gained deck indicating vessel struck upon fatal goodwin sands 
report gun could heard owing gale carrying sound leeward bright line rocket distinctly visible 
moment flaring light burning tar barrel observed 
signal vessel distress southern tail sands 
time gun charged rocket position 
look alive jack fetch poker cried mate primed gun 
jack shales dived companion hatch another moment returned red hot poker mate thrust cabin fire first alarm 
applied quick succession gun rocket 
blinding flash deafening crash followed whiz rocket sprang magnificent curve far away surrounding darkness 
answer south sandhead light fired three guns sent three rockets attract attention gull ceased firing 
also first note warning look pier ramsgate harbor 
three light ships guarded sands gull lay nearest ramsgate hence whichever two happened send signals gull reply thenceforward continue repeating attention ramsgate look gained reply given 
beauty cried mate referring rocket fetch another jack sponge well dick moy give em another shot minutes

jack obeyed jim welton nothing look sought shelter lee weather bulwarks wind according dick moy blowin needles penknives 
third gun thundered forth shook floating light stem stern rocket struck rigging made low wavering flight 
another therefore sent scarcely cut bright line across sky answering signal observed rocket ramsgate pier right duty done said mate went divesting outer garments quietly turned watch sponged covered guns resumed active perambulation deck 
james welton however could calm feelings easily 
first night ever spent light ship scene therefore quite new could help feeling somewhat disappointed sudden termination noise excitement 
told ramsgate lifeboat could less hour seemed excited spirit terrible thing human lives kept long jeopardy 
course began think possible prevent delay better sense whispered excited spirits best judges matters although denied irresistible tendency judge 
nothing however exercise philosophic patience went turned sailors standing ready lifeboat make appearance 
young sailor sleep prompt profound 
seemed minutes laid head pillow jack shale voice resounded cabin lifeboat close alongside sir 
see till moment

question asked answered passed magnificent rush darkness 
reply heard lifeboat shot straight arrow rescue 
reader often hear read scenes tell experience vision necessary enable one realize full import goes 
strange thrill heart young welton saw familiar blue white boat leaping foaming billows 
often seen model quiescence boat house ponderous almost ungainly saw first time action endued life 
fancy warriors might speak heavy cavalry see barracks saw alma 
silent unexciting board gull many minutes later watch shouted skylight tug sight sir 
afterwards ascertained mistake made reference vessel signalled 
one shore reported guns rockets seen flashing north sandhead vessel whereas report vessel south sandhead 
single word important 
effect sending steam tug aid always attends upon ramsgate lifeboat wrong direction involving much loss time 
mention merely fact reproof 
accidents happen even best regulated families 
ramsgate lifeboat service admirably regulated error kind pointed point dozens ay hundreds cases steamer lifeboat gone straight crow flies rescue done good service occasions lifeboats would certainly failed great value steam matters 
occasion however tug appeared somewhat late scene hailed gull 
true state case ascertained course directed aright full steam let 
ramsgate boat tow far astern 
passed brief questions answers repeated benefit coxswain jim welton observed every man boat appeared crouching thwarts except coxswain stood steering tackles 
wonder 
easy matter sit gale wind freezing spray sometimes green seas sweeping one men doubtless wideawake listening far vision went boat manned ten oilskin coats sou westers seconds carried sight great power steam despite loss time reached neighborhood wreck soon broadstairs boat found crew stranded vessel already saved taken ashore deal lifeboat 
may well observe although case much energy expended unnecessarily follow frequently expended 
often far often force lifeboat service coast insufficient meet demands 
crews various boats vicinity goodwin sands frequently called night sometimes night visiting various wrecks succession 
work value steam tug conspicuous tow boat windward wreck renew effort save life cases devoid aid lifeboats would compelled give failure first attempt consequence driven helplessly leeward 
forestalled narrative 
drama far gull light concerned ended night disappearance tug lifeboat 
several days afterwards crew learned particulars wreck connection acted brief important part

chapter ten 
treats tender subjects peculiar kind shows billy towler got scrapes 
fact know day may bring forth receives frequent sometimes striking illustration experience people 
day may begin calm sunshine yet end clouds tempest vice versa truism need enforced 
nevertheless truism men none worse reminded 
poor billy towler powerfully reminded day following night adventure ravens master taught best laid plans men well mice apt get disordered sequel show 
next morning look board gull lightship reported trinity steam tender sight mouth ramsgate harbor ensign hoisted intimation observed 
arrangement way hoisting signal board floating lights trinity yachts chance heave sight clever device whereby vigilance light ship crews secured time appearing yachts irregular therefore matter uncertainty 
every one knows natural almost irresistible tendency human mind relax vigilance demand attention continual act becoming mere matter daily routine loses much intensity 
crews floating lights men required perpetually alert besides danger would threaten innumerable ships vessels drift stations part management neglected great danger run dark stormy nights foggy days 
constant vigilance partly secured doubt sense duty men increased feeling personal risk would result carelessness almost perfected order hoisting flag referred 
superintendent district ramsgate head quarters goes regularly every month tender effect styled relief change men passes two months aboard one month shore masters mates alternately month shore month board 
time puts board four vessels charge namely goodwin gull south sandhead varne light ships water coal provisions oil month stores may required returning men relieved empty casks cans etcetera ramsgate harbor 
besides tender constantly obliged go irregular intervals may even several times week purpose replacing buoys shifted storms marking small green buoys spot vessel may gone become dangerous obstruction fair way taking old chains sinkers placing new ones painting buoys visiting north south foreland lighthouses also district superintendent care 
occasions men duty floating lights bound hoist flag whenever tender chances pass within sight pain severe reprimand duty neglected something worse neglect frequent occurrence 
addition elder brethren trinity house make periodical visits inspection floating lights round coasts england purposely irregular times order possible catch guardians coast napping woe betide watch duty inspecting brethren manage get pretty close light ship without received salute recognition hence men floating lights kept ever alert safety navigation far human wisdom secured 
hence also whatever time floating lights chance visited strangers like lighthouses invariably found perfect working order clean new pins except course periods general cleaning painting 
begging pardon digression return billy towler whose delight novelty recent experiences equalled joyous anticipations stirring sea life yet lay 
satisfaction mr jones however success late venture somewhat damped information would spend whole day board tender 
district superintendent whose arduous multifarious duties required often afloat seemed home tender house ashore man whose agreeable manners kind hearty yet firm disposition made favorite every one service 
immediately boarding gull informed uninvited unfortunate guests floating light would glad take ashore could evening besides effecting relief meant take advantage calm weather give fresh coat paint one two buoys renew chains sinkers expressed hope delay would put much inconvenience 
stanley hall superintendent sprang intimate sympathetic friendship almost first sight assured far putting inconvenience would afford greatest pleasure spend day board 
billy towler heard arrangement come amount satisfaction means shared employer anxious report loss nora without delay claim insurance money soon possible

arrah howld och stiddy heave hooray cried anxious irishman made plunge buoy floating alongside like huge iron balloon bumping big forehead gently yet heavily side tender simple way conveying mind stanley idea great difficulty must attend shifting buoys rough weather 
buoy secured iron hook chain great strength attached ring head 
chain communicated powerful crane rigged foremast wrought steam windlass deck

buoy weighs fully three quarters ton cost less along chain sinker pounds yet one largest 
call monster buoys weighing considerably ton cost pounds apiece including fathom chain hundred weight sinker 
medium sized ones made wood hooped like casks cost pounds pounds apiece without appendages 
even small green fellow lying intend mark nora necessary worth pounds many hundreds buoys round kingdom easily believe guarding shores somewhat costly

engine went last slowly applying almost greatest strain chains could bear bow tender hauled considerably sea 
men drew back little moments suspense motion vessel gradually loosened sinker eased strain 
goes handsomely cried men engine resumed work reasonable speed 
sometimes lose chains sinkers altogether way remarked dick moy billy stood looking heightened color glowing eyes wishing fervor small heart whole affair would give way order might enjoy tremendous crash thought would sure follow

know replied mate glancing timepiece went deck 
upper edge sun visible horizon gleaming haze like speck ruddy fire 
shipping downs rested sea calm rope mast yard faithfully reflected 
ramsgate exception highest spires overshadowed wing approaching night 
goodwin sands partially uncovered looking calm harmless enough snowy ripple northern extremity gently kissed swell north sea nothing save riven stump half buried stem post tell storms wrecks name sadly associated 
around breathed peace tranquillity mate cast searching glance round horizon leaned hatchway shouted lights customary ay ay sir followed prompt appearance crew 
winch manned signal given sun went floating light went scatter guiding warning beams far wide across darkening waste water 
may little volume prove truthful reflector catch beams diverting legitimate direction turn upon shore enlighten mind tickle fancy dwell upon land thus perchance add another thread bond sympathy already existing whose lot battle winds live upon sea
