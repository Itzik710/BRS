theoretic faculty concerned pleasures sense 

explanation term theoretic 
proceed therefore first examine nature called theoretic faculty justify substitution term theoretic sthetic one commonly employed reference 
term sthesis properly signifies mere sensual perception outward qualities necessary effects bodies sense would arrive accurate conclusions difficult subject always used 
wholly deny impressions beauty way sensual neither sensual intellectual moral faculty receiving whose difference mere perception shall immediately endeavor explain term accurate convenient employed greeks theoretic pray permission therefore always use call operation faculty theoria 

differences rank pleasures sense 
let us begin lowest point observe first differences dignity may exist different kinds sthetic sensual pleasure properly called 
evident common brutes peculiar man alone rational test inferiority dignity pleasures 
must assume man nobler animal deduce nobleness delights must prove nobleness delights thence nobleness animal 
dignity affection way lessened large measure may found lower animals neither vileness gluttony lust abated common men 
clear therefore standard dignity pleasures passions also class creatures capable suffering 

use terms temperate intemperate 
first great distinction observe noted aristotle men called temperate intemperate regard respect others respect called common consent held vilest 
aristotle though exquisitely subtle notation facts frequently give us satisfactory account reason 
content stating fact pleasures held lowest shows estimation confuses reader observing casually respecting higher pleasures indeed true appears first opposed position namely men may conceived also taking pleasure either rightly less right 
evident capability excess defect existing pleasures higher order ought told happens men called intemperate indulge excess kind difference nature pleasure diminishes criminality excess 
let us attempt ascertain 

right use term intemperate 
men held intemperate greek akolastoi desires overcome prevent action reason indeed intemperate exact degree prevention interference takes place actually greek akolastoi many instances respect many resolves lower world estimation temperance 
long supposed reason acted imperfectly owing imperfection imperfection premises submitted men give inordinate preference pursuits nature things sufficiently experienced goodness benefit others long may presumed men referred reason suffered orders disobeyed mere impulse desire though orders may full error owing reason feebleness long men held intemperate 
palpably evident reason erred voice deadened disobeyed reasonable creature dragged dead round walls citadel mere passion impulse men held intemperate 
evidently case respect inordinate indulgence pleasures touch taste destructive continuance pleasures sensibilities received penalty actually known experienced indulging reason pronounce right respecting perilousness palliation wrong choice man utterly incapable called intemperate greek akolastos 
would well reader would follow subject would irrelevant pursue farther observing certain degree intemperance suspected attributed men respect higher impulses instance case anger passion criminally indulged yet attributed case sensual pleasures anger reason supposed time operate affected presence passion seizes man involuntarily aware whereas case sensual pleasures act deliberate determined beforehand direct defiance reason 
nevertheless precaution taken immoderate anger passions gain upon man evidently wilful unrestrained admitted contrary reason begin look upon real sense word intemperate greek akolastos assign consequence place among beasts definitely yielded pleasurable temptations touch taste 

grounds inferiority pleasures subjects intemperance 
see primal ground inferiority pleasures proves indulgence contrary reason namely destructiveness upon prolongation incapability co existing continually delights perfections system 
incapability continuance directs us second cause inferiority namely given us subservient life instruments preservation compelling us seek things necessary therefore function fully performed ought end artificially high penalty prolonged 
pleasures sight hearing given gifts 
answer purposes mere existence distinction useful dangerous us might made often made eye without receiving slightest pleasure sight 
might learned distinguish fruits grain flowers without superior pleasure aspect latter 
ear might learned distinguish sounds communicate ideas recognize intimations elemental danger without perceiving either music voice majesty thunder 
pleasures function perform limit continuance accomplishment end end may perpetual us way destructive rather increasing exquisiteness repetition 

evidence higher rank pleasures sight hearing 
herein find sufficient ground higher estimation delights first eternal inexhaustible secondly evidently means instrument life object life 
whatever object life whatever may infinitely desired may sure something divine god make anything object life creatures point partake 
though regard pleasures sight merely highest sensual pleasures though rare occurrence occurring isolated imperfect would still supernatural character owing permanence self sufficiency sensual pleasures permanent self sufficient 
instead scattered interrupted chance distributed gathered together arranged enhance chance could caused feeling strong affection towards object exist perception purpose adaptation desires perception therefore immediate operation intelligence formed us feeds us 
perception arise joy admiration gratitude 
mere animal consciousness pleasantness call sthesis exulting reverent grateful perception call theoria 
full comprehension contemplation beautiful gift god gift necessary added elevating twofold first desire secondly thing desired 

lower pleasures may elevated rank 
joyfulness reverence necessary part theoretic pleasure evident consider presence feelings even lower sensual pleasures may rendered theoretic 
thus aristotle subtly noted call men intemperate much respect scents roses herb perfumes ointments condiments though reason gives futile enough 
fact scents artificially prepared extreme desire intemperance natural god given scents take part harmony pleasantness creation hardly intemperance absolute difference two kinds likely received gratitude joyfulness rather despise seeking essences unguents sowing violets along garden banks 
things may elevated affection spikenard mary song solomon myrrh upon handles lock isaac concerning son 
general law pleasures sought abstract ardently foul things received thankfulness reference god glory become theoretic find something divine sweetness wild fruits well pleasantness pure air tenderness natural perfumes come go list 

ideas beauty essentially moral 
understood formerly said chapter respecting ideas beauty ideas subject moral intellectual altogether sensual perception spoke pleasures connected derived material sources agreeable moral nature purity perfection 
necessary existence idea beauty sensual pleasure may basis accompanied first joy love object perception kindness superior intelligence finally thankfulness veneration towards intelligence idea considered way idea beauty made emotions said idea letter perceive perfume fair writing without understanding contents intent emotions way resultant obtainable operation intellect evident sensation beauty sensual one hand intellectual dependent pure right open state heart truth intensity insomuch even right action intellect upon facts beauty apprehended dependent acuteness heart feeling thus apostolic words come true minor respect others men alienated life god ignorance understanding darkened hardness hearts past feeling give lasciviousness indeed see constantly men naturally acute perceptions beautiful yet receiving pure heart hearts never comprehend receive good make mere minister desires accompaniment seasoning lower sensual pleasures emotions take earthly stamp sense beauty sinks servant lust 

degraded heartless reception 

exalted affection 
world commonly understands cultivation taste anything better least times corrupt pampered civilization men build palaces plant groves gather luxuries devices may hang corners world like fine spun cobwebs greedy puffed spider like lusts middle 
christian times abuse corruption sense beauty pagan life st paul speaks little less essence best know expressions affection towards external nature found among heathen writers balance leading thought cleaves towards sensual parts 
beneficence sought power shunned teaching understood never 
pleasant influences soft winds ringing streamlets shady coverts violet couch plane tree shade received perhaps noble way found anything except fear upon bare mountain ghostly glen 
hybla heather loved sweet hives purple hues 
christian theoria seeks though accepts touches purity epicurean sought finds food objects love everywhere harsh fearful well kind nay even seems coarse commonplace seizing good delighting sometimes finding table spread strange places presence enemies honey coming rock harmonized less wondrous pleasure hating self sighted insolent men work despising god unless reminding god yet able find evidence still seems forgetful turn witness working meant obscure clear unoffended sight beholding forever according written promise blessed pure heart shall see god

go farther examine distinctive nature ideas beauty shall believe perceive something besides sthetic pleasure attests important function belonging attaches sensual ideas exhibits exalted character faculty received 
alluded said chapter already referred may indeed perceive far acquainted nature god constructed healthy state mind derive pleasure whatever things illustrative nature 
point necessary farther develop 
first inquiry must evidently authorized affirm man mind respecting impressions sight healthy state otherwise 
canon test may determine impressions rightly esteemed beautiful authority men variance subject shall deputed judge right authority canon first appear easy prove men ought like one thing rather another although granted generally men speaking bad good taste frequently denied pass particulars assertion individual right opinion right sometimes claimed even moral matters though palpably without foundation appear altogether irrational matters sthetic wherein little operation voluntary choice supposed possible 
would appear strange instance assert respecting particular person preferred scent violets roses right 
yet said sensation beauty intuitive necessary men derive pleasure scent rose assumed sources rightly derived others wrongly derived words men right think things beautiful right remain apathetic regard others 

sense may terms right wrong attached conclusions hence arise two questions according sense word right taken first way impression sense may deceptive therefore conclusion respecting untrue second way impression sense preference one may subject therefore moral duty delinquency 
first questions answer speak immediate impression sense false preference others mistaken one deceived respecting actual sensation perceives prefers 
falsity may attach assertion supposition either perceives object perceived others always perceived always preferred speak man wrong impressions sense either mean feels differently majority respecting certain object prefers present impressions ultimately prefer 
second answer immediate impressions immediate preferences power ultimate impressions especially ultimate preferences though neither choose whether shall see object red green blue determine like red better blue blue better red yet choose make ultimately susceptible impressions degrees capable pleasures different measure wherever power kind given responsibility attached duty men prefer certain impressions sense others power precisely analogous law moral world whereby men supposed capable governing likes dislikes whole culpability propriety actions dependent upon capability men guilty otherwise desire command thou shalt obey thou shalt love lord thy god men capable governing directing affections would command impossibility 

power impressions sense 
assert therefore even respect impressions sense power preference corresponding duty shall show first nature power afterwards nature duty 
let us take instance one lowest senses observe kind power impressions lingual taste 
first offering two different things palate power prevent command instinctive preference 
one unavoidably helplessly preferred 
two things submitted judgment frequently attentively often found relations change 
palate first perceived coarse violent qualities either becomes experienced acquire greater subtilty delicacy discrimination perceiving agreeable disagreeable qualities first unnoticed continued experience probably become influential first impressions whatever final verdict may felt person gives received others correct one first 

depends acuteness attention 
power preference impressions taste actual immediate power testing comparing frequently carefully permanent consistently agreeable determined 
instrument taste thus degree perfected rendered subtile practiced upon single object conclusions rapid respect others able distinguish quickly things even prefer qualities calculated finally give pleasure though capable respect frequently exercised whence people called judges respect particular object taste 

ultimate conclusions universal 
verdicts kind received authoritative others proves another important fact namely changes opinion take place consequence experience changes variation opinion unity opinion whatever may differences estimate among unpractised uncultivated tastes unity taste among experienced 
therefore operation repeated trial experience arrive principles preference sort common part nature 
selected sense taste instance least favorable position hold since latitude allowed actual variety verdict case sense yet however susceptible variety even ultimate approximations preferences may authority judges distinctly allowed hear every day admission unpractised palate may wrong opinions respecting real pleasurableness things either others 

duty attached power impressions sense

stated duty less imperative attached every power possess therefore power lower senses well others 
duty evidently bring every sense state cultivation shall form truest conclusions respecting submitted procure us greatest amount pleasure consistent due relation senses functions 
three constituents perfection sense true judgment maximum sensibility right relation others invariably co existent involved one true judgment result high sensibility high sensibility right relation 
thus instance respect pleasures taste duty devote inordinate attention discrimination must inconsistent pursuit destructive capacity higher preferable pleasures cultivate sense way consistent good temperance namely attention mind certain resting moments may fitly pay even ignoble source pleasure discipline shall bring faculty taste real maximum sensibility may doubted health hunger general refinement bodily habits shall make body perfect fine instrument respects better promoters actual sensual enjoyment taste sickened sluggish hard stimulated fastidiousness epicurism

seems never rightly understood even intelligent among architects proportion way connected positive size seems held among small building may expanded large one merely proportionally expanding parts harmony equally agreeable whatever scale rendered 
true apparent proportion utterly false constructive much value architectural proportion constructive error often productive painful results 
may best illustrated observing conditions proportion animals 
many persons thoughtlessly claimed admiration strength supposed gigantic insects smaller animals capable lifting weights leaping distances surmounting obstacles proportion apparently overwhelming 
thus formica herculanea lift mouth brandish like baton sticks thicker six times length scrambling crags proportionate height cliffs dover three four minute 
nothing extraordinary exertion strength necessarily greater human proportion size body 
evident size strength creature expanded diminished proportion distance leap time maintain exertion third term resultant remains constant diminish weight powder ball proportionately distance carried constant nearly 
thus grasshopper man giant feet high supposing muscular strength equally proportioned size could leap proportionate distance nearly distance say four feet grasshopper forty eight times length six feet man length exactly ten feet giant tenth length 
hence small animals coeteris paribus perform feats strength agility exactly much greater executed large ones animals smaller enable elephant leap like grasshopper must endowed strength million times greater proportion size 
consequence general mechanical law increase scale animals means power whether muscles motion bones support must increased proportionate degree become utterly unwieldy incapable motion limit increase strength 
elephant legs long spider combination animal matter could hide bound would strength enough move support megatherium must humerus foot diameter though perhaps two feet long vertical position gnat hang window frame poise sting middle crooked stilts like threads stretched ten times breadth body side 
increase size megatherium little phosphate lime bear would crush legs powder 
compare sir charles bell bridgewater treatise hand p note 
hence limit size animals conditions matter activity also largest always least capable exertion would case far greater extent nature beneficently alters proportions increases scale giving seen long legs enormous wings smaller tribes short thick proportion larger 
vegetables compare stalk ear oat trunk pine mechanical relations 
also waves large never mere exaggerations small different slopes curvatures mountains things else necessarily ordinary mechanical laws 
whence architecture according scale building proportions must altered hesitation calling unmeaning exaggeration parts st peter flutings volutes friezes etc proportions smaller building vulgar blunder one destroys majesty building ought still call imitations adaptations large buildings small scale 
true test right proportion shall inform us scale building even drawing shall instantly induce conception actual size size intended 
know fuseli means aphorism disproportion parts element hugeness proportion grandeur

universal feeling respecting necessity repose art

probably necessity imperatively felt artist test unfailing greatness artistical treatment appearance repose yet quality whose semblance mere matter difficult define illustrate 
nevertheless believe instinctive love well cause attribute love although also former cases contend interpretation fact readily allowed reader 
opposed passion changefulness laborious exertion repose especial separating characteristic eternal mind power creator opposed become creatures sign alike supreme knowledge incapable surprise supreme power incapable labor supreme volition incapable change stillness beams eternal chambers laid upon variable waters ministering creatures saw infinity type divine nature one hand became yet desirable peculiar address prison hopes expectations unsatisfied unaccomplished existence types third attribute deity might seem rendered farther attractive mortal instinct infliction upon fallen creature curse necessitating labor unnatural still painful desire rest planted heart sensual unworthy one longing renovation escape state whose every phase mere preparation another equally transitory one permanence shall become possible perfection 
hence great call christ men call st augustine fixed essential expression christian hope accompanied promise rest death bequest christ men peace 

repose expressed matter 
repose expressed material things either simple appearance permanence quietness massy forms mountain rock accompanied lulling effect mighty sight sound feel none define would less sacred explicable greek heudousin diore n koruphai te kai pharanges else repose proper rest things vitality capability motion actual imagined respect expression repose greater proportion amount sublimity action taking place well intensity negation 
thus speak repose stone motion stone nothing energy vitality neither repose stability 
seen great rock come mountain side noble sensation rest bedded immovably among fern power fearfulness motion great stability negation motion great proportion 
hence imagination delights nothing enhancing characters repose effects usually either attributing things visibly energetic ideal stability things visibly stable ideal activity vitality

two senses word ideal 
either refers action imagination 
perfect idea form condition properties species fully developed called ideal species 
question nature ideal conception species mode mind arrives subject much discussion source much embarrassment chiefly owing unfortunate distinction idealism realism leads people imagine ideal opposed real therefore false think necessary request reader careful attention following positions 
work art represents material object mental conception material object primary sense word ideal say represents idea thing 
work art represents realizes material object primary sense term unideal 
ideal works art therefore first sense represent result act imagination good bad proportion healthy condition general power imagination whose acts represent

nevertheless word ideal long universally accepted sense think better continue use reader careful observe distinction sense according subject matter discussion 
present using expressive noble generic form indicates full perfection creature functions wish examine far perception exists may exist nature nature us discoverable imaginable 

ideal form 
first lower animals 
better wish arrive truth always take familiar instances wherein mind likely biassed elevated associations favorite theories 
let us ask therefore first kind ideal form may attributed limpet oyster say whether oysters come entire notion idea oyster 
apprehend although respect size age kind feeding may difference yet full size healthy condition found many fulfil conditions oyster every respect perfectly could combining features two together produce perfect oyster see 
suppose also number healthy fish birds beasts species would easy select individual superior rest neither comparing two nobler examples together arrive conception form superior either though accidents abundant food fitting habitation may induce among varieties size strength color yet entire generic form would presented many neither would art able add diminish 

consistent 
therefore hardly right use word ideal generic forms creatures see actual examples use distinctly understood ideality consists full development powers properties creature inconsistent accidental imperfect developments even great variation average size ideal size neither gigantic diminutive utmost grandeur entireness proportion certain point mean size individuals always fall short generic size rise generic average mean size

conception bodily ideal reached 
ordinary process realization ideal bodily form reached explanation enough treatises art far well comprehended need stay long consider 
far sight knowledge human form purest race exercised infancy constantly excessively exercises dignity twists straining dexterities natural exercises running casting riding practiced endurance extraordinary hardship hardens degrades body natural hardship vicissitudes winter summer cold heat yet climate none severe surrounded also certain degree right luxury soften refine forms strength far sight could render mental intelligence right human form acute able abstract combine best examples produced perfect far greek conceived attained ideal bodily form greek modes attaining well produced perfect example chiefly dwell writers whose opinions subject collected wholly losing sight seems important branch inquiry namely influence good evil mind upon bodily shape wreck mind modes may conceive restoration 

modifications bodily ideal owing influence mind 
first intellect 
operation mind upon body evidence thereon may considered following three general heads 
first operation intellectual powers upon features fine cutting chiselling removal signs sensuality sloth blunted deadened substitution energy intensity vacancy insipidity wants alone faces many fair women utterly spoiled rendered valueless keenness given eye fine moulding development brow effects sir charles bell well noted desirableness opposition brutal types p third edition sufficiently observed certain virtues intellect measure inconsistent perhaps great subtlety great comprehensiveness high analytical high imaginative power least consistent compatible signs upon features outward form express without measure expressing neither certain separate virtues outward form correspondent constant employment prevailing capacity brain piercing keenness open reflective comprehensiveness eye forehead virtues form ideal signs worthiest powers intellect though present stay inquire 

secondly moral feelings 

beauty bestowed second point considered influence mind upon body mode operation conjunction moral feelings intellectual powers conjoint influence bodily form 
operation right moral feelings intellect always good latter possible selfishness reason rightly respect must blind estimation worthiness things neither anger overpowers reason outcries neither sensuality overgrows chokes neither agitation time compare things together neither enmity must unjust neither fear exaggerates things neither cunning deceit voluntarily untrue soon unwittingly great reasoners self command trust unagitated deep looking love faith reason best holds reins high seat err grossly think right development even intellectual type possible unless look higher sources beauty first 
nevertheless though operation upon moral feelings thus elevatory mental faculties yet conjunction seem occupy fulness room absorb overshadow else simultaneous exercise sort impossible cause occasionally find moral part full development action without corresponding expanding intellect though never without healthy condition wordsworth high hour visitation living god thought think look far enough shall find intelligence immediate act effort laborious struggling imperfect intellectual faculty high moral emotion inconsistent though feel deeply reason shrewdly yet doubt except feel deeply ever comprehend fully climbing mole like piercing sitting upon central throne emergence light intellectual faculties full heart feeling allows 
hence therefore indications countenance hard cut lines rigid settings wasted hollows speak past effort painfulness mental application inconsistent expression moral feeling infelicitous augury full serene development habitual command look solemn thought brow unison signs emotion become softened gradually confounded serenity authority nobler origin

virtue exercise even momentarily impress new fairness upon features neither whole body intelligence moral faculties operation even movement gestures however slight different modes according mind governs gentleness decision feeling follows grace action continuance grace form discipline may taught attained 

soul culture interferes harmfully bodily ideal 
third point considered respect corporeal expression mental character certain period soul culture begins interfere characters typical beauty belonging bodily frame stirring intellect wearing flesh moral enthusiasm burning way heaven emaciation earthen vessel indication subduing mortal immortal part ideal glory perhaps purer higher range perfect material form 
conceive think nobly weak presence paul fair ruddy countenance daniel 

inconsistency among effects mental virtues form 

sign god kind purpose towards race 

consequent separation difference ideals 
observed consideration three directions mental influence several times compelled stop short definite conclusions owing apparent inconsistency certain excellences beauties tend first different kinds intellect secondly moral faculties intellectual separately examined moral emotions found certain inconsistencies among also soul culture generally bodily perfections

therefore investigating signs ideal perfect type humanity must presume singleness type yet hand must cautiously distinguish differences conceivably existing perfect state differences resulting immediate present operation adamite curse

thirdly ferocity fear 
latter distinguished awe 

holy fear distinct human terror 

ferocity joined always fear 
unpardonableness 
respecting two vices human face expressions fear ferocity less noted occasionally enter conception character necessary make careful distinction conception power destructiveness majesty matter influence agent actual fear possible conceive terribleness without position obnoxious danger without fear feeling arising contemplation dreadfulness safety stormy sea shore properly termed awe noble passion whereas fear mortal extreme may felt respecting things ignoble falling window without conception terribleness majesty thing accident dreaded even fear felt respecting things sublime thunder storm battle yet tendency destroy power contemplation majesty freeze shrink intellect shaking heap clay absolute acute fear unworthiness contempt whatever source arise degrades mind outward bearing body alike even though among hail heaven fire running along ground

expressions sought painters powerless impious

passion generally 

never exhibited least face 
four passions whose presence degree human face degradation 
passion generally observed becomes ignoble either entertained respecting unworthy objects therefore shallow unjustifiable impious violence destructive human dignity 
thus grief noble reverse according dignity worthiness object lamented grandeur mind enduring 
sorrow mortified vanity avarice simply disgusting even bereaved affection may base selfish unrestrained 
grief convulses features ignoble commonly shallow certainly temporary children though shock shiver strong man features sudden violent grief may something sublime 
grief guercino hagar brera gallery milan partly despicable partly disgusting partly ridiculous grief injured egyptian driven forth desert destiny nation heart servant work turned away stealing tea sugar 
common painters forget passion absolutely great violent proportion weakness mind deal exaggerating outward signs exalting passion evaporating hero 
think much passions always nature forgetting love achilles different love paris alcestis laodamia 
use value passion subject contemplation breaks fountains great deep human mind displays mightiness ribbed majesty mountains seen stability best among coil clouds whence fine think held passion attains overwhelming power resisting conquered creature contemplated unfit high art destructive ideal character countenance respect hold raffaelle erred endeavor express passion acuteness human face fragment massacre innocents gallery wherein repainted though suppose purpose master yet understood subjects represented entire expression may given without degrading face shall presently see done unspeakable power tintoret think subjects kind human misery slaughter famine plague peril crime better main avoided unprofitable hardening influence unless far suffering hinted rather expressed may raise nobler relief eternal enduring fortitude affection mercy self devotion threshing floor ornan cave lazarus angel lord seen chastisement love manifested despair men 

recapitulation thus sort enumerated evil signs necessary shunned seeking ideal beauty though knowledge dread hatred effectually aid painter hand mere admission loveliness good holy expression subtile characters traced 
raffaelle questioned subject made doubtful answer probably could trace early teaching dies emotion image sealed upon heart 
bacon well saw impossibility reaching combination many separate beauties yet explains nature kind felicity attributes success 
suppose conceived wrought loveliest things done theorizing simple labor love could put bar rationalism defend points done painted delight delight besides always respect conscience fear swerving right maketh diligent observers circumstances loose regard whereof nurse vulgar folly less solomon attention thereunto natural furtherances effectual make eminent others gave good heed pierced everything ground 
good heed watching instants men feel warmly rightly indians diamond washing sand desire hope finding true good men ready vanity sets fiction instantly carries potter wheel always come clay vessels regular shape instead pure mirror show seraph standing human body standing signal heavenly land heed charity none us may bring lamp upon path spenser sang beauty fond men misdeem outward show things seem fair lamp whose celestial ray light proceeds kindleth lover fire shall never extinguished decay

partial examination imagination attempted 
hitherto exclusively occupied sources pleasure exist external creation faithful copy must certain extent exist also 
sources beauty however presented great work art form pure transcript 
invariably receive reflection mind whose shadow passed modified colored image 
modification work imagination 
course succeeding investigation shall called upon constantly compare sources beauty existing nature images presented human mind necessary us shortly review conditions limits imaginative faculty ascertain tests may distinguish sane healthy profitable operation erratic diseased dangerous 
neither desirable possible examine illustrate full essence mighty faculty 
examination would require review whole field literature would alone demand volume 
present task explain exhibit full portraiture function mind relations obtain certain tests may determine whether imagination unmask impersonations chiefly respect art literature faculty takes thousand forms according matter treat becomes like princess arabian tale sword eagle fire according war wages sometimes piercing sometimes soaring sometimes illumining retaining image except supernatural power shall content tracing particular form unveiling imitations found feared painting referring creations mind illustration 

works metaphysicians nugatory respect faculty 
unfortunately works metaphysicians afford us interesting inquiry aid whatsoever 
constantly endeavoring fathom explain essence faculties mind sure end lose sight explained though may defined felt shall presently show essence imaginative faculty utterly mysterious inexplicable recognized results negative results absence metaphysicians far acquainted works miss altogether never reach higher definition fancy false name 
understand fancy presently appear contend nomenclature distinction two mental faculties whatever name called one source great poetic arts merely decorative entertaining often confounded together much common render strict definition either difficult 

definition stewart inadequate 
dugald stewart meager definition may serve us starting point 
imagination says includes conception simple apprehension enables us form notion former objects perception knowledge make selection abstraction separates selected materials qualities circumstances connected nature judgment taste selects materials directs combination 
powers may add particular habit association formerly gave name fancy presents choice different materials subservient efforts imagination may therefore considered forming ground work poetical genius 
fancy passage find referring chapter treating nothing meant rapid occurrence ideas sense mind 
definition point purpose inquiry missed 
told judgment taste directs combination 
order anything may directed end must previously determined faculty determines end frame make boned fleshed conceived seen end bare judgment taste approve existence yet dugald stewart definition left catering among host conceptions produce combination work must see approve exists 
power prophecy essence whole matter inexplicable part metaphysician misses

would difficult find milton passage less power imagination shown description eden suppose passage meant beginning fourth book find three expressions power shown burnished golden rind hung amiable hesperian fruit lays forth purple grape vine fringed bank myrtle crowned lake stewart meant accumulation bowers groves lawns hillocks imagination composition commonest kind 
hence take passage real imagination shall find stewart hypothesis inefficient obscure utterly inapplicable 

various instances

three operations imagination 
penetrative associative contemplative 
find imagination three totally distinct functions 
combines combination creates new forms secret principle combination shown analysts 
treats regards simple images combinations peculiar ways thirdly penetrates analyzes reaches truths faculty discoverable 
three functions shall endeavor illustrate order logical mode treatment would follow order commonly mind works penetrating first combining next treating regarding finally arrangement would inconvenient acts penetration regard closely connected like relations mental acts wish examine consecutively rather higher subject matter mere act combination whose distinctive nature property makes imagination composition think best explain setting easily may subjects familiar material 
shall therefore examine imaginative faculty three forms first combining associative secondly analytic penetrative thirdly regardant contemplative 
footnotes continues thus illustrate observations let us consider steps milton must proceeded creating imaginary garden eden 
first proposed subject description reasonable suppose variety striking scenes seen crowded mind 
association ideas suggested power conception placed beauties imperfections 
every natural scene destine particular purpose defects redundancies art may sometimes always correct 
power imagination unlimited 
create annihilate dispose pleasure woods rocks rivers 
milton accordingly would copy eden one scene would select features eminently beautiful 
power abstraction enabled make separation taste directed selection 
chapter ii 
imagination associative 

simple conception 
order render inquiry easy possible shall consider dealing associative imagination simplest possible matter conceptions material things 
first therefore must define nature conceptions 
beholding examining material object knowledge respecting exists two different forms 
facts exist brain verbal form known conceived instance heavy light eight inches quarter long etc length accurate conception conception might attach length seven inches nine fact may recollect without conception object 
facts respecting exist brain visible form always visible voluntarily visible white complicated shape form rose bud instance would difficult express verbally neither retained brain verbal form visible one wish knowledge form immediate use summon vision image thing remember words remember fact took many days blow gathered time 
knowledge things retained visible form called conception metaphysicians term shall retain inaccurately called imagination taylor passage quoted wordsworth preface poems term imagination etymologically rightly expressive want term higher faculty 

connected verbal knowledge 
many questions respecting faculty conception great interest exact amount aid verbal knowledge renders visible instance verbal knowledge flower five seven ten petals muscle inserted point bone aids conception flower limb amount aid visible knowledge renders verbal instance whether one asked question animal thing instantly verbal knowledge answer may power summoning image animal thing ascertain fact actual beholding assert conceive possible indefinite subtile character conception men admits traced realized yet sure test likeness representation thing like intaglio front light whose lines seen yet fit one definite form accurately many questions irrelevant present determine since forward present purpose well suppose conception aided verbal knowledge absolutely perfect suppose man retain clear image large number material things seen able set paper perfect fidelity absolute memory minute features 
thus setting paper works suppose exactly would work nature copying remembered image mind instead real thing 
therefore still nothing copyist 
exercise imagination whatsoever 

used composition 
images vivid distinct nature command nature 
summon chooses therefore group received nature altogether mind liberty remove component images add others foreign arrange whole 
let us suppose instance perfect knowledge forms aiguilles verte argenti great glacier upper extremity valley chamonix 
forms mountains please presence glacier suits purpose 
removes glacier sets mountains farther apart introduces part valley rhone 
composition dugald stewart mistook imagination kingdom noble faculty part lot 

characteristics composition 
essential characters composition properly called 
mind desires new feature summons images supposes kind wanted takes one supposes fittest tries answer tries another obtained association pleases 
operation little sensibility regards absolute beauty value images brought takes thinks fairest interesting without regard sympathy whose company destined 
kind vulgar composition mulino claude described preface first part characteristic example 
mind higher feeling look sympathy contrast features likeness dissimilarity take thinks best features resembling discordant put together satisfied repeat process features cutting away one part putting another working delicately lowest details dint experiment repeated trials shiftings constant reference principles two lines must mimic one another one mass must equal another etc morticed together satisfactory result 

powers implied 
first three functions fancy 
process rapid effective proportion artist powers conception association turn depending knowledge experience 
distinctness powers conception give value point truth every fragment draws memory 
powers association knowledge nature pour greater less number appositeness images choose 
experience guides quick discernment combination made parts offensive require change 
elevated power mind association images apposite resemblant whatever kind wanted called quickly multitudes 
power brilliant called fancy meaning word fancy meaning relation function imagination considering fancy three functions one subordinate three functions imagination 
great differences power manifested among artists respect hosts distinct images always command rapidly discerning resemblance contrast others images obscure disposal readily governing 
powers fancy brilliant picture becomes highly interesting images systematically rightly combined truthfully rendered become even impressive instructive wittily curiously combined captivating entertaining 

imagination yet manifested 
time imagination shown 
except gift fancy may taught easily comprehended analyzed imagination neither taught efforts attained acuteness discernment dissected analyzed 
seen composition mind take cognizance likeness dissimilarity abstract beauty among ideas brings together 
neither likeness dissimilarity secures harmony 
saw chapter unity likeness destroyed harmony unity membership difference necessarily secure particular imperfection harmonizing parts supplied fellow part 
therefore combination made harmonious artist must induce component parts suppose two simplicity sake imperfection shall put right 
one perfect excrescence 
must faulty separate corrected presence 
accomplish result beautiful whole organized body dependent members inventor 
let separate features beautiful apposite resemblant may form whole 
two members glued together 
carpenter joiner 

imagination correlative conception imperfect component parts 
conceivable imperfections single feature infinite 
impossible therefore fix upon form imperfection one try forms imperfection one fits two imperfections must corelatively simultaneously conceived 
imagination properly called imagination associative grandest mechanical power human intelligence possesses one appear marvellous longer consider 
operation two ideas chosen infinite mass evidently matters whether imperfections conceived infinite number conceivable selected number recollected two ideas separately wrong together shall right whose unity therefore idea must formed instant seized unity either good therefore conception unity prompt preference 
prophetic action mind infinite mass things tried together seizes instant two fit together right yet disagreeable alone 

material analogy imagination 
operation mind far see absolutely inexplicable something like chemistry 
action sulphuric acid metallic zinc affords instance called disposing affinity 
zinc decomposes pure water common temperatures extreme slowness soon sulphuric acid added decomposition water takes place rapidly though acid merely unites oxide zinc 
former explanation affinity acid oxide zinc disposed metal unite oxygen thus enabled decompose water oxide zinc supposed produce effect previous existence 
obscurity explanation arises regarding changes consecutive reality simultaneous 
succession process oxide zinc formed previously combination acid instant 
one chemical change consists combination one moment zinc oxygen oxide zinc acid change occurs two affinities acting together overcome attraction oxygen hydrogen one another 
imaginative artist permit us deference represent combining intelligence figure sulphuric acid suppose fragment zinc embarrassed among infinitely numerous fragments diverse metals oxygen dispersed mingled among gases countless indistinguishable shall excellent type material things action imagination immaterial 
actions think inexplicable however simultaneous chemical changes may yet causing power affinity acid existence 
neither explained affinity operates atoms uncombined artist desire unconceived whole prompts selection necessary divisions 

grasp dignity imagination 
operation would wonderful enough concerned two ideas 
powerfully imaginative mind seizes combines instant two important ideas poem picture works one instant working modifying relations never losing sight bearings motion snake body goes parts volition acts instant coils go contrary ways 
faculty indeed something looks man made image god 
inconceivable admirable altogether divine yet wonderful may seem palpably evident less operation necessary production great work definition unity membership essential characteristic greatness certain couples groups parts parts noble work must separately imperfect must imply ask rest glory every one must consist relation rest neither much one wanting right 
evidently impossible conceive separate feature certain want wrongness corrected features picture one two merely unless together want conceive also wanted rest work picture 
hence fuseli second thoughts admissible painting poetry dressers first conception great idea ever formed fragments 
alone conceive compose sees whole 

limits 
however limit power human imagination 
relations observed absolutely necessary highly complicated mind grasp result total deprivation power imagination associative matter 
reason human mind ever conceived new animal 
evident animal every part implies rest form eye involves form brow nose form forehead lip head chin physically impossible conceive one members unless conceive relation bears whole animal relation necessary certain complicated allowing license inaccuracy intellect utterly fails load reduced mere composition putting bird wing men shoulders half human body half horse action imagination fancy though treatment contemplation compound form may much imagination shall presently see

first place colossal statue necessarily exaggeration represents miniature diminution need representation giant representation large scale man observed plane intersecting cone rays us object must receive image smaller object small image rationally completely expressive larger one large small one 
hence think statues elgin standard michael angelo night morning measure taken eye representations giants think always disagreeable

chapter v superhuman ideal 

subject treated detail 
investigation first section laws beauty confined observation lower nature humanity 
prevented proceeding deduce conclusions respecting divine ideality established principles respecting imaginative faculty discipline theoretic ideality conceived 
purposed conclude present section careful examination subject evidently foreign matter immediately discussion involves questions great intricacy respecting development mind among pagan nations supposed produced high examples spiritual ideality believe better delay inquiries concluded detailed observation beauty visible nature shall therefore present take notice one two broad principles referred implied chapter respecting human ideal without enunciation chapter might lead false conclusions 

conceivable modes manifestation spiritual beings four 
four ways beings supernatural may conceived manifesting human sense 
first external types signs influences god moses flames bush elijah voice horeb 
second assuming form properly belonging holy spirit dove second person trinity lamb manifestations angelic form first person trinity seem made abraham moses ezekiel 
third manifestation form properly belonging necessarily seen risen christ disciples doors shut 
fourth operation human form influence inspire shining face moses 

creature forms familiar us 
evident cases wherever form form creature us known 
new form peculiar spirit 
conceive none 
inquiry simply therefore modifications creature forms us known lamb bird human creature may explained signs habitations divinity angelic essence creatures seem 

supernatural character may impressed either phenomena inconsistent common nature compare chap 

may done two ways 
first effecting change appearance creature inconsistent actual nature giving colossal size unnatural color material gold silver flame instead flesh taking away property matter altogether forming light shade intermediate step cloud vapor explaining terrible concomitant circumstances wounds body strange lights seemings round joining two bodies together angels wings 
means attaining supernatural character though nature ordinary vulgar yet effective glorious mighty hands already seen limits speaking imagination 

inherent dignity 
second means obtaining supernatural character concerned namely retaining actual form full material presence without aid external interpretation whatsoever raise form mere inherent dignity pitch power impressiveness assert stamp superhuman 
north side campo santo pisa series paintings old testament history benozzo gozzoli 
earlier angelic presences mingled human occur frequently illustrated awfulness light incorporeal tracing 
clear revealed move human forms broad daylight open earth side side hand hand men 
never miss angel 
reached last pinnacle utmost power ideal art 
stands need thenceforward cloud lightning tempest terror mystery 
sublime independent elements 
shall stand shall melt fervent heat light firmament sun sackcloth hair 

st expression inspiration 
let us consider means effected far analysis traceable far always find greater part rightly accomplished done faith intense feeling aid rules teaching either tried estimated imitated 
first expression supernatural influence forms actually human sibyl prophet 
evident unnecessary altogether liberty trust expression utmost ennobling human form form actual representation recipient divine presence 
hence order retain actual humanity definitely must leave upon signs operation sin liability death consistent human ideality often definite signs immediate active evil prophetic spirit expressed men saul balaam neither may ever discrimination touch utmost limits beauty human form inspiration expressed angelic divine reserve subjection instructive instances found works angelico invariably uses inferior types features humanity even glorified excepting always madonna ever exerts full power beauty either feature expression except angels madonna christ 
expression spiritual influence without supreme elevation bodily type seen work imagination penetrative found accomplished michael angelo think 
aware one else mind expressed inspiration prophet sibyl however affirm shall leave determination reader principles present noted refer entirely elevation creature form necessary actually representative spiritual 

representation creature possible 
affirmed conclusion first section creature creature ever conceived 
think almost self evident clear illimitableness divine attributes matter represented though may typefied believe acquainted range sacred art admit representation christ ever even partially successful greatest painters fall therein accustomed level perugino fra angelico especially leonardi think done best perhaps beauty fragment left milan spite said repainting destruction cenacolo still finest existence much dependent untraceableness resulting injury original perfection 
daring attempts representation divinity need speak noted respecting though ignorant romanists many efforts made idea actual representation note way cellini speaks seal made pope nobler among suppose intended us rate may always received mere symbols noblest could employed much symbols still triangle alpha omega think scrupulous amongst christians ought desire exchange power obtained use symbol michael angelo creation adam eve effect would produced substitution triangle sign place 
efforts need reason farther may limit considering purest modes giving conception superhuman still creature form angels equal rank perhaps may without offence place mother christ least must regard type madonna receiving romanist painters 

supernatural character expressed modification accessories 
first much done right modification accessory circumstances express miraculous power exercised spiritual creature 
beautiful instance john bellini picture st jerome venice 
saint sits upon rock grand form defined clear green open sky reading noble tree springs cleft rock bends suddenly back form rest volume shoots sky 
something beautiful obedient ministry lower creature observed sweet feeling whole depends upon service consistent nature 
animated listen saint bend towards affection would mere fancy illegitimate effectless 
simple bend trunk receive book miraculous subjection true nature tree therefore imaginative touching 

landscape religious painters 
character eminently symmetrical 
often however religious painters even go length content usually impressing landscape perfect symmetry order may seem consistent induced spiritual nature would represent 
signs decay disturbance imperfection also banished evident unnaturalness singularity must result inasmuch veritable forms landscape express imply state progression imperfection mountain forms seen produced convulsion modelled decay finer forms cloud stories storm forest grouping wrought varieties strength growth among several members bears evidences struggle unkind influences 
appearances banished supernatural landscape trees grow straight equally branched side slight feathery frame shows never encountered blight frost tempest 
mountains stand fantastic pinnacles trace torrent scathe lightning fallen fragments encumber foundations worn ravines divide flanks seas always waveless skies always calm crossed fair horizontal lightly wreathed white clouds 

landscape benozzo gozzoli 
cases conditions result partly feeling partly ignorance facts nature incapability representing first type treatment found giotto school others observed principle benozzo gozzoli perugino raffaelle 
beautiful instance former frescoes ricardi palace behind adoring angel groups landscape governed absolute symmetry roses pomegranates leaves drawn last rib vein twine fair perfect order delicate trellises broad stone pines tall cypresses overshadow bright birds hover serene sky groups angels hand joined hand wing wing glide float glades unentangled forest 
behind human figures behind pomp turbulence kingly procession descending distant hills spirit landscape changed 
severer mountains rise distance ruder prominences less flowery vary nearer ground gloomy shadows remain unbroken beneath forest branches 

landscape perugino raffaelle 
landscape perugino grace purity much nature consistent named conditions unrivalled interesting certainly whatever limits set rendering nature proceed incapability 
sea distance almost always blue promontories undulating dewy park ground studded glittering trees landscape fresco st maria maddalena florence variety usual gentle river winds round bases rocky hills river like wye tees loveliest reaches level meadows stretch away opposite side mounds set slender stemmed foliage occupy nearer ground small village simple spire peeps forest bend valley remarkable architecture thus employed neither perugino ideal painters ever use italian forms always transalpine church castle 
little landscape forms background portrait uffizii another highly finished characteristic example 
landscape raffaelle learned father continued time little modified though expressed greater refinement 
became afterwards conventional poor cases altogether meaningless 
haystacks vulgar trees behind st cecilia bologna form painful contrast pure space mountain country perugino opposite 

landscape imitated 
cases would uphold landscape thus employed treated worthy admiration sorry advance imitation 
right mannerism arose keen feeling painter imitated without feeling would painful safe mode following steps attain perfect knowledge nature suffer feelings guide us selection fitting particular purpose 
every painter ought paint loves others loved mind pure sweetly toned loves lovely otherwise example guide selection precept govern hand farther let distinctly observed mannered landscape right supposition background supernatural presence behind mortal beings would wrong landscape ridiculous farther chief virtue results exquisite refinement natural details consistent character botanical drawing flowers clearness brightness sky 

color decoration 
use representations supernatural 
another mode attaining supernatural character purity color almost shadowless darkness allowed absolutely necessary explanation forms vividness effect enhanced far may use gilding enamel jewellery 
think smaller works angelico perfect models respect glories heads beaten rays gold light plays changes spectator moves therefore throw purest flesh color dark relief color light obtained enamelling angel wings course utterly unattainable expedient art colors draperies always pure pale blue rose tender green brown never dark gloomy faces celestial fairness brightly flushed height glow flush noticed constantin reserved older painters spiritual beings expressive light seen body 
think necessary insist value seemingly childish means hands noble painter assert also futility even absurdity employed exalted power 
think error commonly side scorn reject much foolish vanity wiser earnest delight 
two points necessary note use accessories 

decoration used must generic 
first ornaments used angelico giotto perugino especially angelico always generic abstract character 
diamonds brocades velvets gold embroideries mere spots gold color simple patterns upon textureless draperies angel wings burn transparent crimson purple amber set forth peacock plumes golden circlets gleam changeful light beaded elaborate pearls set studied sapphires 
works filippino lippi mantegna many painters following interesting examples may found opposite treatment lippi heads usually sweet composition severe degrading effect realized decorations imitated dress may seen simply without addition painfulness deficiencies feeling 
larger two pictures tuscan room uffizii defect would noble ideal work 

color pure 
second point observed brightness color altogether inadmissible without purity harmony sacred painters must followed frankness unshadowed color unless also follow clearness 
far acquainted modern schools germany seem entirely ignorant value color assistant feeling think hardness dryness opacity virtues employed religious art whereas hesitate affirm art clearness luminousness intensity hue essential right impression walls arena chapel rainbow play brilliant harmonies solemn purple tones perugino fresco albizzi palace know great work sacred art precious color qualities unless indeed crucifixion fra angelico florence academy glazed pumiced painted varnished picture cleaners glares one end picture gallery pure white light delicate hue idealists whose colors preference seen beautiful chapter purity carefully distinguished golden light deep pitched hue school titian whose virtue grandeur earthly solemnity glory heavenly rejoicing 

ideal form body variety susceptible 
leaving accessory circumstances touching treatment bodily form evident first place whatever typical beauty human body capable possessing must bestowed upon understood spiritual 
therefore general proportions types deducible comparison nobler individuals race must adopted adhered admitting among human ideal varieties result past suffering contest sin consistent sinless nature signs instantly continually operative affections though conceivable spirit suffer inconceivable spiritual frame retain like stamped inelastic human clay brand sorrow past unless fallen 
face deep scars thunder entrenched care sat faded cheek 
yet far forth angelic ideal diminished could suffered pictorial representation 

anatomical development far admissible 
muscular development necessary perfect beauty body rendered 
necessary strength appears result laborious exercise inadmissible 
herculean form spiritual degrading spiritual creature suppose operative impulse bone sinew power immaterial constant neither dependent developed exertion 
generally well conceal anatomical development far may even michael angelo anatomy interferes divinity hands lower men angel becomes preparation 
far possible subdue generalize naked form venture affirm believe best conceal far may draperies light undulating fall exhibit principal lines draperies severe linear constantly employed time raffaelle 
recollect single instance naked angel look boylike child like unspiritualized even fra bartolomeo might advantage spared pictures lucca hands inferior men sky merely encumbered sprawling infants domenichino madonna del rosario martyrdom st agnes peculiarly offensive studies bare legged children howling kicking volumes smoke 
confusion seems exist minds subsequent painters angels cupids 

symmetry 
valuable 
farther qualities symmetry repose peculiar value spiritual form 
find former earnestly sought great painters arrangement hair wherein loosely flowing varied form admitted restrained undisturbed equal ringlets often infant christ fra angelico supported forehead forms sculpturesque severity 
angel masaccio deliverance peter grand countenance motion loses much spirituality painter put little much character hair left disordered 

influence greek art dangerous 

scope limited 
repose exalting power already said enough present purpose though insisted peculiar manifestation christian ideal opposed pagan 
well questions relating particular development greek mind foreign immediate inquiry therefore shall conclude hope resuming detail examining laws beauty inanimate creation always however holding certain whatever kind degree short coming may possible short coming visible every pagan conception set beside christian believing part deficiency difference kind must make greek conception full danger student proportion admiration think fatally seen effect italian schools pernicious element first mingled solemn purity recently influence french historical painters neither present knowledge fix upon ancient statue expresses countenance one elevated character soul single enthusiastic self abandoning affection much less majesty feeling might mark features supernatural
