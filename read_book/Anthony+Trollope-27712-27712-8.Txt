chapter iv 
vacillation 
spring time came sir harry hotspur wife daughter went london 
last season house bruton street empty 
wife mourning lost son place gaiety london lives 
sir harry still thinking great loss 
always thinking boy gone apple eye one great treasure human world whose superior importance ready heart hearts admit needful outer signs sorrow laid aside emily hotspur taken london order might suited husband 
truth reason going 
neither sir harry lady elizabeth would cared leave cumberland cause 
would altogether content remain home emily obedient enough winter accept hand suitor proposed 
house opened bruton street lord alfred came see 
also cousin george 
reason cousin george come 
indeed done must ungracious cousins 
came found lady elizabeth emily home 
emily told always receive visitors sundays morning church came 
made communication lord alfred perhaps would hardly natural done 
lady elizabeth note occasion write lord alfred tell custom sunday afternoon lord alfred took immediate advantage offer cousin george 
regarded outward appearance life hotspurs gayer may heretofore living london 
dinner parties whereas previous times dinners friends might join ball 
box opera horses park understanding dealings madame milvodi milliner unlimited occasion demanded 
perceived every one miss hotspur settled life 
knew story lord alfred 
every one knew facts property emily position heiress though every one probably know still sir harry power leave every acre property pleased 
emily understood 
lay upon terrible responsibility best hotspur interests 
death brother time blackest misfortunes less thought position 
steady enough refusal lord alfred knowing well enough cared nothing 
since come upon moments almost regret unable accept 
would easy way escape troubles without assistance madame milvodi opera box park horses time ideas another man ideas make think work madame milvodi opera box would unnecessary 
came question asking cousin george house 
already told come sundays next sunday 
given cause offence humblethwaite lady elizabeth opinion asked dinner 
asked omission would show afraid 
lady elizabeth exactly explain husband accurately know fear sir harry understood feelings yielded 
let cousin george asked dinner 
sir harry time vacillating weakness would expected man generally firm affairs life 
quite clear george hotspur inquiries first made mind first accepted notion lord alfred chosen son law 
sea 
conscious importance daughter case could bring ease allow expect girl would ordinary course nature dispose young heart injury might reasonably hoped temperament character education 
could protect daily hourly thought 
marriage marriage girls 
house hotspur lived prospered many centuries live prosper rather mainly man choose husband 
girl important disposed importance would almost end 
sir harry recess mind almost conviction although thing utmost moment would better better better hotspurs matter allowed arrange special judgment used selection 
almost believed girl left girls 
thing moment could save always eyes 
yet knew aid forthcoming lady elizabeth 
tried hand choice proper husband daughter would none man chosen 
brought london thrown upon market 
let madame milvodi opera box park horses could 
course watch kept doubt excellence thing disposed important girl mode disposing might without disgrace fault part vitally prejudicial family let remembered curled darling eldest son would suit exigencies case unless eldest son willing altogether merge claims family make name purpose hotspur 
child present son law heir noble house future earl say even duke embryo would nothing sir harry 
ambition see daughter duchess 
wanted name place dominion hotspur greater higher noble hotspurs claimed could maintain 
humblethwaite scarrowby lost amidst vast appanages domains titled family whose gorgeous glories new paltry comparison mellow honors house would ruin hopes 
might indeed arrangement second son proceeding marriage future chance hotspur claims hotspurs thought high holy future chance case one generation least hotspurs would abeyance 
desired 
would suffice 
son law desired well born perfect gentleman belongings child might proud one content rest claims material prosperity personal position name wealth would obtain wife 
lord alfred man girl would none lord alfred eldest sons might plenty ready take bride eldest son come ask daughter hand eldest son would almost right claim girl consent gained could refuse yet leave hotspur behind living humblethwaite hotspurs follow hotspur 
might venture think cousin george cousin george coming house wife telling incumbent ask young man dinner 
incumbent unless meant let know regarded absolutely stranger one taken chose drop 
ugly story reached sir harry ears cousin george 
said twice borrowed money money lenders commission passing document security value security barely escaped detection two jews knowing commission would forfeited altogether fraud brought light 
commission sold proceeds divided jews certain remaining claims cousin george personal estate 
story vague way reached sir harry ears 
easily man sir harry learn details disreputable cousin life 
among old friends none dear lord milnthorp among younger friends none intimate lord burton eldest son lord milnthorp lord alfred brother 
lord burton told story telling time could vouch truth 
upon word know said lord burton interrogated 
think would regard though never heard 
course debt 
altogether another thing said sir harry 
altogether think probably pawn commission 
bad bad 
charge doubt 
said lord burton sir harry determined accusation go nothing 
child child transmitter great things fortune given whose hands lie glories humblethwaite scarrowby giving away honor ancient family could trusted one must admitted early life disreputable even world lenient judgment matters fail stigmatize dishonourable respects however manifestly man daughter ought given marriage arrangement would title property kept together sir harry could make word given daughter heiress 
let make arrangements might cousin george death would head family 
every peerage printed would tell old story world 
certain courtesies law descent future heirs would hotspurs daughter married lord alfred like children marriage would hotspurs truth courtesy law even kindness minister sovereign could child union become baronet sir harry day head family 
position one sovereign minister could achieve touch bestow 
beyond power earthly potentate deprive would transmitted son absolute security 
alas alas sir harry gave indication thought expedient change mind subject 
lady elizabeth proposed cousin george asked dinner frowned looked black acceded truth vacillated 
allurements side great could altogether force upon duty throwing 
knew cousin george fitting husband girl man would thought giving happiness object 
think bestowing 
became uneasy remembered danger 
unhappy remembered amusing handsome attractive cousin george 
feared emily might like means hoped 
yet vacillated allowed cousin george come house cousin george must become death head hotspurs 
cousin george came one sunday came another sunday dined house course asked ball 
lady elizabeth arranged little affairs cousin george left bruton street evening dinner party emily never two minutes alone together since family come london 
lady elizabeth liked cousin george edict effect pronounced husband would left alone together great maternal satisfaction 
told therefore young people never allowed opportunities 
lady elizabeth quiet way knew work world allotted 
balls ridings park chances life young men sometimes young women also know well use hitherto cousin george kept constrained keep distance 
want know mamma said emily hotspur day ball whether cousin george black sheep white sheep mean dear asking question like black sheep 
see young men allowed black sheep yet know 
helped people notice mamma 
dear difficult question quite beyond sure beyond 
sheep black always always quite white know black lambs dear mother white 
dearer think 
quite agree emily general society black sheep avoided 
allowed come said emily 
lady elizabeth knew danger danger kind enabled specially consult sir harry 
chapter v george hotspur 
little must told reader cousin george ways life 
lady elizabeth said daughter question admitting black sheep society refusing admittance difficult 
first place whose eyes good enough know whether truth sheep black fact little amount shade fleece male sheep considered absolutely desirable rate quite pardonable male sheep fleece white ewe lamb considered among muttons somewhat insipid taste pope conscious declared every woman heart rake 
comes pass black sheep indeed admitted society till last anxious fathers anxious mothers begin aware young ones turned graze among ravenous wolves 
however must admitted lambs treated acquire courage tends enable hold even amidst wolfish dangers 
cousin george ravenous wolf rate black sheep indeed 
anxiety know truth must said absolutely wolf yet career yet made premeditated attempts devour prey 
process delivering devoured others done things known sheep prevent sheep received decent flock 
little trouble commission although intended cheat either jew done world would called cheating world known 
getting goods tradesmen without hope thought paying much thing custom indeed also almost excused considering normal condition life man position 
gamble lose money come quite naturally early age 
come upon idea might turn tables gambling transactions one must win lost much possibly might win 
quite yet reached point education gambler learns ready way win much win unfairly quite yet near 
wolfhood coming unless good fortune might save 
might however good fortune store 
lady elizabeth said sheep dark color might become white 
doctrine repentance believe blackness male sheep regard sin venial blackness 
whether teller tale say outright may matter dispute unless say teller tale know tell tale truly 
blackness condoned sheep received almost flock condition repentance humiliation confession simply change practice 
change practice certain circumstances certain period becomes expedient made regards tints wool nature sheep becomes white needed 
respect sheep black sheep present period life need much change would fit decent social herding 
shades black come conviviality may call table blackness opinion constantly disseminated moral newspapers day come altogether end blackness among sheep gentlemen 
make indeed expressed piquant newspapers day opinion ladies taking game gentlemen longer care play 
may doubted whether either expression much truth 
see ladies drunk certainly see gentlemen tumbling used fashion drinking grandfathers 
love wine gone among men men prone ever indulge loves 
black sheep fond wine also brandy though wolf enough hide taste occasion required 
early life come france live england placed cavalry regiment unfortunately quartered either london vicinity 
perhaps equally unfortunate possession small fortune year 
come father father died paris two years date story received accession regular income 
couple thousand pounds reached hands father effects helped immediately pressing difficulties day income time altogether dissipated 
received much larger sum cousin assurance however family property would become succeeded family title 
penniless time prone live hand mouth little given consideration future may doubted whether sum given compensation full withheld 
still chance heiress regarding chance soon determined would marry cousin might within power 
knew fully appreciated advantages 
handsome man tall hotspur hotspur fair hair blue eyes well cut features
