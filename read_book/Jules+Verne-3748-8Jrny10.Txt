happily great harm came

quite liberty express opinions 
longer nephew colleague 
pray go 
well first place wish ask jokul sneffels scartaris names never heard nothing easier 
received long ago map friend augustus petermann liepzig 
nothing could apropos 
take third atlas second shelf large bookcase series z plate 
rose help precise instructions could fail find required atlas 
uncle opened said one best maps iceland handersen believe solve worst difficulties 
bent map 
see volcanic island said professor observe volcanoes called jokuls word means glacier icelandic high latitude iceland nearly active volcanoes discharge beds ice 
hence term jokul applied eruptive mountains iceland 
good said sneffels hoping question would unanswerable mistaken 
uncle replied follow finger along west coast iceland 
see rejkiavik capital 
well ascend innumerable fiords indent sea beaten shores stop sixty fifth degree latitude 
see see peninsula looking like thigh bone knee bone end 
fair comparison lad 
see anything upon knee bone yes mountain rising sea 
right 
sn fell 
sn fell 
mountain five thousand feet high one remarkable world crater leads center earth 
impossible said shrugging shoulders disgusted ridiculous supposition 
impossible said professor severely pray crater evidently filled lava burning rocks therefore suppose extinct volcano extinct yes number active volcanoes surface globe present time three hundred 
much larger number extinct ones 
sn fell one 
since historic times one eruption mountain time quieted 
longer reckoned among active volcanoes 
positive statements could make reply 
therefore took refuge dark passages document 
meaning word scartaris kalends july uncle took minutes consider 
one short moment felt ray hope speedily extinguished 
soon answered thus darkness light 
proves ingenious care saknussemm guarded defined discovery 
sneffels sn fell several craters 
therefore necessary point leads center globe 
icelandic sage observed approach kalends july say last days june one peaks called scartaris flung shadow mouth particular crater committed fact document 
could possibly exact guide soon arrived summit sn fell shall hesitation proper road take 
decidedly uncle answered every one objections 
saw position old parchment impregnable 
therefore ceased press upon part subject things must convinced passed scientific objections opinion far serious 
well said forced admit saknussemm sentence clear leaves room doubt 
even allow document bears every mark evidence authenticity 
learned philosopher get bottom sneffels seen shadow scartaris touch edge crater kalends july may even heard legendary stories told day crater reaching center world reaching performing journey returning ever went say never never 
reason said uncle ironically 
theories science demonstrate feat impracticable 
theories say replied professor tone meek disciple 
oh unpleasant theories theories hinder 
us saw laughing went 
yes perfectly well known internal temperature rises one degree every feet depth admitting proportion constant radius earth fifteen hundred leagues must temperature degrees center earth 
therefore substances compose body earth must exist state incandescent gas metals resist action heat gold platinum hardest rocks never either solid liquid temperature 
therefore good reason asking possible penetrate medium 
axel heat troubles course 
reach depth thirty miles arrived limit terrestrial crust temperature degrees 
afraid put state fusion leave decide question answered rather sullenly 
decision replied professor liedenbrock putting one grandest airs 
neither anybody else knows certainty going interior globe since twelve thousandth part radius known science eminently perfectible every new theory soon routed newer 
always believed fourier temperature interplanetary spaces decreased perpetually known present time greatest cold ethereal regions never lower degrees zero fahr 
internal heat certain depth attain impassable limit instead rising point fuse infusible metals uncle taking stand upon hypotheses course nothing said 
well tell true savants amongst poisson demonstrated heat degrees existed interior globe fiery gases arising fused matter would acquire elastic force crust earth would unable resist would explode like plates bursting boiler 
poisson opinion uncle nothing 
granted 
likewise creed adopted distinguished geologists interior globe neither gas water heaviest minerals known none cases would earth weigh 
oh figures may prove anything facts known number volcanoes diminished since first days creation central heat may thence conclude process diminution good uncle enter legion speculation discuss matter longer 
tell highest names come support views 
remember visit paid celebrated chemist humphry davy born nineteen years afterwards 
well humphry davy call upon way hamburg 
long engaged discussing amongst problems hypothesis liquid structure terrestrial nucleus 
agreed could liquid state reason science never able confute 
degrees temperature given jules verne according centigrade system case substitute fahrenheit measurement 
tr 
reason said rather astonished 
liquid mass would subject like ocean lunar attraction therefore twice every day would internal tides upheaving terrestrial crust would cause periodical earthquakes yet evident surface globe subject action fire replied quite reasonable suppose external crust cooled first whilst heat took refuge center 
quite mistake uncle answered 
earth heated combustion surface 
surface composed great number metals potassium sodium peculiar property igniting mere contact air water metals kindled atmospheric vapors fell rain upon soil waters penetrated fissures crust earth broke fresh combustion explosions eruptions 
cause numerous volcanoes origin earth 
upon word clever hypothesis exclaimed spite rather 
humphry davy demonstrated simple experiment 
formed small ball metals named fair representation globe whenever caused fine dew rain fall upon surface heaved little monticules became oxydized formed miniature mountains crater broke open one summits eruption took place communicated whole ball heat could held hand 
truth beginning shaken professor arguments besides gave additional weight usual ardor fervent enthusiasm 
see axel added condition terrestrial nucleus given rise various hypotheses among geologists proof internal heat opinion thing besides shall see like arne saknussemm shall know exactly hold truth concerning grand question 
well shall see replied feeling carried contagious enthusiasm 
yes shall see possible see anything 
may depend upon electric phenomena give us light may even expect light atmosphere pressure may render luminous approach center yes yes said possible

silence hear silence upon whole subject let one get us design discovering center earth

hans laid provisions upon block lava ate good appetite 
one thing troubled supply water half consumed 
uncle reckoned upon fresh supply subterranean sources hitherto met none 
could help drawing attention circumstance 
surprised want springs said 
anxious water enough five days 
uneasy axel shall find want 
left bed lava behind us 
could springs break walls perhaps passage runs great depth 
seems made great progress vertically 
suppose gone deep crust earth encountered greater heat 
according system said uncle 
thermometer say hardly fifteen degrees fahr nine degrees since departure 
well conclusion conclusion 
according exact observations increase temperature interior globe advances rate one degree fahr 
every hundred feet 
certain local conditions may modify rate 
thus yakoutsk siberia increase degree ascertained reached every feet 
difference depends upon heat conducting power rocks 
moreover neighborhood extinct volcano gneiss observed increase degree attained every feet 
let us therefore assume last hypothesis suitable situation calculate 
well calculate boy 
nothing easier said putting figures note book 
nine times hundred twenty five feet gives depth eleven hundred twenty five feet 
accurate indeed 
well observation feet level sea

last observation remarked made island geyser mean axel island 
decline honor given name first island ever discovered central parts globe 
well said let axel island 
cleared two hundred seventy leagues sea six hundred leagues iceland 
well answered uncle let us start point count four days storm rate less eighty leagues twenty four hours 
right would make three hundred leagues 
yes liedenbrock sea would six hundred leagues shore shore 
surely axel may vie size mediterranean

curious circumstance added computations right nine hundred leagues rejkiavik mediterranean head 
good long way friend 
whether turkey atlantic depends much upon question direction moving
