sturdy toddling rogue full life laughter mischief died one day illness hour seemed absurd thing dead thing could laughed belief forced soul like burning searing iron 
think grieved little son death deeply sincerely ever man could 
heart father heart mother 
time brought healing josephine fretted pined cheeks lost pretty oval red mouth grew pale drooping 
hoped spring might work miracle upon 
buds swelled old earth grew green sun gulls came back gray harbor whose grayness grew golden mellow thought see smile 
spring came came dream child fear companion bed board sunsetting sunsetting 
one night awakened sleep realizing moment awakening alone 
listened hear whether wife moving house 
heard nothing little splash waves shore low moan distant ocean 
rose searched house 

know seek venture started along shore 
pale fainting moonlight 
harbor looked like phantom harbor night still cold calm face dead man 
last saw wife coming along shore 
saw knew feared great fear 
drew near saw crying face stained tears dark hair hung loose shoulders little glossy ringlets like child seemed tired intervals wrung small hands together 
showed surprise met held hands glad see

awakened darkness heard calling shore 
sad little wailing cry david cold lonely wanted mother 
hurried could find

oh tried hard overtake could 
saw little white hand beckoning far ahead moonlight 
still could go fast enough 
cry ceased alone terrible cold gray shore 
tired came home 
wish could found 
perhaps know tried 
perhaps thinks mother never listened call 
oh would think 
bad dream dear said 
tried say naturally hard man speak naturally feels mortal dread striking vitals deadly chill 
dream answered reproachfully

follow would even storm darkness 
said cry sounded loudest nearest pretty boy frightened tempest 
wild terrible rovings straining forward eager overtake dream child sick heart following guiding protecting best could afterwards leading gently home heart broken could reach child 
bore burden secret determining gossip busy wife condition long could keep becoming known

restraint sterner husband loving hand ever put upon pretty piteous darling 
never spoke dream child 
doctor advised 
would said serve deepen delusion 
hinted asylum gave look would fierce word another man 
never spoke 
one night august dull murky sunset dead breathless day heat wind stirring 
sea blue sea pink pink ghastly staring painted pink 
lingered harbor shore house dark 
evening bells ringing faintly mournfully church across harbor 
behind kitchen heard wife singing 
sometimes spirits fitfully high would sing old songs girlhood 
even singing something strange wailing unearthly cry rang 
nothing sadder strange singing 
went back house rain beginning fall wind sound air dismal stillness world holding breath expectation calamity 
josie standing window looking listening 
tried induce go bed shook head

always afraid sleep fear call mother fail hear 
knowing use entreat sat table tried read 
three hours passed 
clock struck midnight started wild light sunken blue eyes 
calling cried calling storm 
yes yes sweet coming opened door fled path shore 
snatched lantern wall lighted followed 
blackest night ever dark darkness death 
rain fell thickly heavily 
overtook josie caught hand stumbled along wake went speed recklessness distraught woman 
moved little flitting circle light shed lantern

could overtake moaned josie 
could kiss hold close aching heart 
pain never leaves would leave 
oh pretty boy wait mother coming 
listen david cries cries pitifully listen hear hear clear distinct deadly still darkness us came faint wailing cry 
going mad something something cried moaned longing human love yet ever retreating human footsteps superstitious man nerve shaken long trial weaker thought 
terror took possession terror unnameable 
trembled every limb clammy perspiration oozed forehead possessed wild impulse turn flee anywhere away unearthly cry 
josephine cold hand gripped mine firmly led 
strange cry still rang ears 
recede sounded clearer stronger wail loud insistent wail nearer nearer darkness beyond us 
came little dory beached pebbles left receding tide 
child boy perhaps two years old crouched bottom dory water waist big blue eyes wild wide terror face white tear stained 
wailed saw us held little hands 
horror fell away like discarded garment

fro went noiseless ministry long dreadful days wore away quiet smile lips dark sorrowful eyes rapt look pictured saint dim cathedral niche 
world outside bare room lay repulsive object loved 
one day doctor looked grave 
grown well hardened pitiful scenes life time shrunk telling eunice brother could live 
never seen devotion 
seemed brutal tell vain 
eunice seen 
took calmly doctor thought 
reward last 
thought amply sufficient 
one night christopher holland opened swollen eyes bent 
alone old house 
raining outside drops rattled noisily panes 
christopher smiled sister parched lips put feeble hand toward 
eunice said faintly best sister ever man 
treated right stood last 
tell victoria tell good voice died away inarticulate murmur 
eunice carr alone dead 
buried christopher holland haste privacy next day 
doctor disinfected house eunice stay alone might safe make arrangements 
shed tear doctor thought rather odd person great admiration 
told best nurse ever seen 
eunice praise blame mattered nothing 
something life snapped vital interest departed 
wondered could live dreary coming years 
late night went room mother brother died 
window open cold pure air grateful drug laden atmosphere breathed long 
knelt stripped bed 
mother said aloud kept promise 
tried rise long staggered fell across bed hand pressed heart 
old giles blewett found morning
