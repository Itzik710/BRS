chapter xxi diplomacy waymark good deal frank talk meeting ida sunday 
conversation know habitual 
circumstances however felt behoved become especially clear one two points never mind course might ultimately pursue always needful dissect motives might least acting full consciousness 
one thing clear enough 
fiction mere friendship ida impossible support 
impossible different circumstances year ago likely last week ida could little conceal feelings changed 
future could accept love join lives without legal bond thinking present happiness content let things arrange would years come heart strongly opposed step 
clearly ida changed life sake undergoing hardships hope winning respect well love 
would done without something hope might regain place every day world held waymark worthy become wife could certainly know little doubt hope led 
could believe capable yet nobler ideas could think reverence sanctity love without regard things acted way regarding indeed equal would open heart speak somewhat way 
yes love time know well uncertainty love go pretence binding ever 
accept love present sincerity neither hoping fearing knowing whatever happens beyond control feeling ignoble nature descend affectation union real links broken could waymark felt sure answer appeal would gone far make love ida engrossing 
would ideal woman devotion would bounds 
felt strongly thus speaking would sadden destruction great hope 
hand offer make legal wife would yet greater injustice even willing sacrifice 
necessity legal marriage would confession inferiority sense thus bound would well knew surest means weakening affection 
affection could trust 
far mere passion senses gratification would speedily kill case feeling towards maud enderby doubt 
never blood calm presence 
spirit spirit loved 
maud might look forward union distant day union outwardly conventional kind 
would account inferiority ideal maud felt height thought whither would time follow simply point principle would demand refusal yoke respectability attendant social advantages 
thought thus binding maud nothing repulsive links kind easily yield loyalty higher nobler nature may well deemed duty 
far logical arguing 
fact remained least intention breaking intercourse ida despite certainty passion would grow upon meetings rendering mutual relations dangerous 
one thing could sure marriage thought 
remained danger led conduct would source grievous unrest ida would lay foundation much suffering 
waymark honest enough self communing admit could trust 
gross deception incapable would answer temptation pressing hard might guilty allowing ida think love worth really 
knew contempt conventional ties faith would keep pressing step disliked would trust without 
trust would unmerited 
significant take account loyalty maud help resisting temptation 
sure regarded purer love let might happen loyalty maud would unshaken 
independent passion passion could shake 
came subject proposed acquaintance ida mrs casti 
impulse friendship led conceiving idea together perhaps recollection ida said loneliness questions asked mrs casti 
waymark little doubt questions indicated desire become acquainted friends desire natural circumstances 
still regretted done 
introduce ida friends would almost equivalent avowing conventional relations 
next place would obstacle way relations becoming anything conventional 
well exactly kind aid needed pursuing course felt right truly yet point waymark broke half contemptuous half indulgent laugh frequently interrupted self communings nearly one clock set call ida 
day fine left steamer putney walked heath good spirits cheerful talk 
ida circumstances sunlight fresh breeze different sitting yonder little room lamp burning table quietness night around 
calm pleasure passionless intercourse realized sufficing 
ida seemed content enjoy moment wistfulness eyes new strong influence 
easy find indifferent subjects conversation avoid seriousness would fatal 
found pleasant spot rest awhile turning back waymark made mind fulfil promise julian 
rather strange said asking questions mrs casti 
since discovered probably know 
ida looked surprised 
remember schoolfellow called harriet smales name marriage 
ida became grave thought moments speaking 
yes remember said pleasantly 
care renew acquaintance said waymark half glad spite spoke way 
ida asked earnestness made discovery 
waymark hesitated length told truth 
explained mrs casti suffered want companionship mentioned ida name julian whence discovery 
told asked ida 
nothing said till spoken 
waymark paused presently continued serious tone 
recurring conversation julian friend trouble spoke strongly overcame selfish thoughts 
said come know chance strange might sound simply friends 
glanced instant ida eyes turned ground 
believe went quickly tell really said nothing never doubt word ida quiet reply 
casti overjoyed thought finding friend wife 
course told must certainly count either consent wife thought perhaps doubtful 
could really use asked ida silence little free time supposing would welcome really believe could great use 
strange creature miserably weak body mind 
could get regard sort good work called upon undertake would likely little less angel mercy 
casti falling grievous unhappiness understand sufficiently come know 
think bears malice know nothing 
casti said never spoken way 
still scar forehead often wondered came 
ida winced 
little termagant must exclaimed waymark laughing 
hard fancy age ida 
quarrel speak replied low sad voice 
long ago want forget 
waymark kept silence 
wish friend ida asked suddenly looking 
certainly dislike thought 

think would good would like help friend yes waymark reply 
hope willing let go see 
best 
let us lose time trying 
strange thing meet way perhaps something chance 
waymark smiled 
think superstitious asked quickly 
often feel 
sorts hopes faiths would laugh 
ida thoughts busy night past future 
first mention harriet name given shock brought back vividness saddest moments life awoke bitter resentment mere memory longer kept power revive 
moment however 
accustomed thought easier seemed bury past forgiveness 
harriet must changed much since days 
possibly would never mention old trouble practically would new acquaintances would little helped understanding recollections childhood 
ida felt much glad new prospects 
longed world substantial imaginations thought would opened 
introducing friends waymark strengthened relations 
giving chance showing new light 
first time would see ordinary conditions woman life home circle ida passed one extreme 
present nothing desired much simple conventional every day existence woman never swerved beaten track 
never saw family group anywhere without envying happiness seemed involved mere fact home relations 
isolation weighed heavily upon 
one could claim services right return render simple hum drum affection goes much easing burden life 
weary solitary heroism though never regarded heroism merely path naturally led feelings 
waymark could still think much old light wished prove completely changed 
simple act making tea came see pleasure domestic womanly often glanced face see whether noticed 
fact harriet invalid would give many opportunities showing could gentle patient serviceable 
casti would observe things doubtless would speak waymark 
thinking way ida became eagerness new friendship 
course possibility harriet would refuse accept offered kindness seemed unlikely disappointment would great could bear dwell thought 
waymark promised come soon news 
time would go slowly till saw 
waymark met harriet seldom late 
julian spent regularly one evening week occasionally waymark paid visit turn 
knew anything welcome mrs casti course neither interest understanding conversation julian 
formerly tried best find common subject talk effort vain hopelessly stupid often surly mood made mere presence difficult endured 
late whenever came made illness excuse remaining bed room 
hence arose another trouble 
two rooms divided folding doors harriet got impatient conceived visitor undue stay would rap doors summon julian 
rapping would take place sometimes six seven times half hour till waymark hastened away annoyance 
indeed little possibility conversing julian room 
julian sat ever state nervous apprehension dreading summons sure come long 
left room moment obedience waymark could hear harriet voice speaking peevish ill tempered tone julian would return pale agitation unable utter consecutive words 
little better meeting waymark even julian anything ease 
would often sit long time gloomy silence seldom could even affect old cheerfulness 
change year made painful 
face growing haggard ceaseless anxiety 
slightest unexpected noise made start nervously 
old enthusiasms dying away 
daily work burden grew oppressive 
always seemed weary alike body mind 
harriet ailments unreal kind hysterical women often affect mere sake demanding sympathy though certain made 
scrofulous taint constitution declaring many ways 
serious symptoms took form convulsive fits 
julian return home one evening found stretched upon floor unconscious foaming mouth struggling horribly 
since come back every night agonies miserable anticipation 
illness miseries course much intensified self willed habits 
remained away home till midnight julian always fear lest accident happened twice late declared whether truly impossible say fits open street 
weather made difference would leave home pretence making necessary purchases would come back drenched rain 
protest availed nothing save irritate 
times conduct utterly unreasonable julian looked see whether lost senses 
bore patience could rivalled 
moments softened burst hysterical weeping begged forgive unusual violence pleading illness cause sensible compassion always vowed mind bear anything rather deal harshly 
love true sense never felt pity often led effusions tenderness love could scarcely exceeded 
giving everything 
whole evenings would sit lay pain holding hands talking way thought would amuse interest 
sorry married would often say times 
good saying sure 
always made julian think father promise always friend poor weak ailing creature strengthened resolution bear everything 
waymark decided would venture step going see harriet daytime whilst julian away order speak ida 
monday lucky enough find home 
evidently surprised visit perhaps still kind friendly way began speak 
minutes worked round subject 
said friend young lady lonely wanted find agreeable companion 
occurred perhaps might ask allowed introduce 
waymark concluded would probably best way putting harriet would perhaps flattered asked confer favor acquaintance 
indeed seemed even something like momentary touch color pale cheek 
julian know asked fixing eyes closest scrutiny 

would leave conclusion liked relations ida reality mattered little 
one went great regard 
say really friends earns living 
feel sure would find company pleasant sensible cheerful would grateful kindness showed 
name ida starr

indeed strange would knew already 
spoken tell knew name 
oh years years ago

harriet went ask many questions answered satisfactorily could end expressed quite willing renew ida acquaintance 
waymark watched face closely able read pretty accurately passing mind

waymark said asked julian standing still looking 
spoke quietly face betrayed annoyance 
harriet merely laughed ill natured maliciously suggestive laugh rose seat 
julian came faced 
harriet said perfect gentleness though lips trembled always prefer think worst people always look good rather evil people meet 
different good many things see said harriet sneer 
countenance darkened 
julian learned significance looks tones well 
circumstances would better keep silence something compelled speak

lonely would rejoice feel friend help comfort 
events judge merits put aside kind prejudice said suppose must get know first ominous commencement would circumstances julian prepared decided hostility even hopeful 
met waymark next change manner obvious almost cheerful 
improvement held ground next two three weeks went

latter noticed change surprise 
things go well still would ask julian came evening 
well indeed 
harriet one night week

three weeks gone julian asked one night hesitation putting question whether waymark saw often 
pretty often reply 
tutor sort way 
read together kind thing 
lodgings yes 
seem queer arrangement seems intelligent said julian letting question pass speaking constraint 
pity find employment better suited see open 
could suggest anything julian silent 
case last long suppose said looking smile rather trembling lip 
gazed moment 
said waymark shaking head smiling 
think 
perfectly understood us agreeable company absolutely nothing beyond 
motive leading astray matter 
however things would tell frankly 
another silence 
think anything like confidence wife waymark asked 
hardly know 
present course talk ordinary women interests household affairs 
means well knowing whether spoken wife particular way nothing kind ever hinted waymark julian continued pause strange fellow 
respect 
mean tell honestly well mean say love girl going say said julian usual bashfulness heightened case feeling made pale 
meant really believe kind regard beyond mere friendship formed conclusions point could help look said waymark thinking moment insensible dog treasure thrown feet quite incapable appreciating making use 
feel position must difficult one 
perhaps rather speak things contrary 
perfectly right position difficult well could 
made choice suppose knew ida far even made yet 
sure chance ever marrying maud enderby utterly remote ought put aside thought 
case strange state mind said julian forced laugh 
possible balance feelings way position would doubt know miss enderby said julian reddening 
waymark walked room hands behind back brows bent 
never told friend anything ida earlier history felt half tempted let know everything 
might possibly give additional motive clear speedy decision difficulties grew ever pressing 
yet ida speak things even one would certainly repeat word twice began yet end variety motives kept silent 
well exclaimed shortly talk another time 
perhaps shall tell 
gloomy 
look upon end novel 
goes smoothly shall finish fortnight read 
hope may better luck said julian 
oh time yet come 
likely shall better 
things book scarcely recommend british parent

said julian smiling capitalist 
yes much good 
since first evening julian refrained speaking wife ida beyond casual remarks questions could carry significance 
harriet likewise silent 
far could observed however seemed take pleasure ida society julian said apparently good result 
home formerly health even seemed profit change 
still something altogether natural julian could scarcely bring believe happy turn things seemed taking 
harriet corresponding growth cheerfulness good nature 
quiet quietness altogether pleasant though thoughts constantly occupied never hitherto moral condition hardly likely subject meditations 
julian sat reading sometimes became desperately aware eyes fixed many minutes time 
happening looked smile 
dear asked turning round

much better lately said taking hand playfully 
let feel pulse know half doctor 
drew away peevishly

julian presently went back book 
could seen look harriet turned upon face averted would read calmly 
evening harriet subject short conversation ida waymark sat together usual way 
fear never anything like confidence us ida saying 
know sometimes almost afraid sometimes looks speaks hated 
poor ill conditioned creature waymark plied rather contemptuously 
explain asked ida mr casti married life half believe mere pity wonder proposal came side 
casti might done something afraid never

pity heart whenever see together 
often discouraged cold suspicious ways half thought give felt would cruel desert

sacrificed situation 
time give much absolute loss 
oh work hard make 
dissatisfied would matter much one things waymark ever saying spite

waymark also showed unusual embarrassment 
stood moments table turning leaves book

many things wanted speak opportunity wanting 
sometimes point asking let write

feared might studying hard 
hope threw away books whilst sea side 
found little pleasure

difficulties kind could speak asked hesitation 
kept eyes lowered fingers writhed nervously arm chair

traceable doubt earliest years 
explain fully tell circumstances life could little interest 
tell waymark replied earnestly

feeling must experienced something troubles overcome 
perhaps could help understand 
thought could would give great happiness
