really religious minds solutions would 
would intolerable thought sincere puritan tolerance daughter marry catholic arrangement would mean either indifferent vital religion married man whose creed bound abhor anathematise however willing mr norris might meet papists terms social friendliness however much might respect personal characters yet thought life one dear irretrievably bound catholic creed involved simply impossible one

old nun talk much girl dogmatic religion difficult position 
timid certainly betraying faith silence also timid betraying trust speech 
sometimes felt gone far sometimes far enough whole practice never suggest questions answer isabel asked occupy affirmative rather destructive criticism 
hesitated honor dead less dared love god isabel

summer days went every day brought fresh rumor campion 
sir owen hopton governor tower first committed prisoner little ease began treat honor talked mysteriously secret interviews promises understandings gradually began get campion yielding kindness seen queen recant paul cross even see canterbury 
last rumor caused great indignation lambeth anthony pressed ever get authentic news could jesuit

favourably inclined catholics divided opinion feared indeed yielded excess agony others proved right truth came given names already known authorities though even asked public pardon scaffold 
towards end august archbishop sent expressly anthony bade accompany chaplain following day tower present public disputation take place english divines jesuit 
chance craved said grindal

following day early morning sunshine minister anthony rode together tower arrived minutes eight clock passed stairs st john chapel seats reserved 
indeed true authorities determined give campion chance also determined make small possible 
even told discussion take place morning occasion allowed opportunity developing theological position entire conduct debate hands adversaries might parry seldom riposte never attack 
anthony found seat looked round chapel 
almost immediately opposite raised platform pillar stood two high seats occupied deans nowell day conduct disputation talking heads together secretary arranging great heap books table 
either side east west stretched chairs divines support debate need platform anthony chair filled crowd clergy courtiers laughing chatting together 
little table also heaped books seats notaries stood center nave far number little wooden stools prisoners occupy 
plainly allowed advisers books even physical support table chairs denied spite weary racked bodies 
chapel bright morning sunlight streamed east windows bare norman sanctuary hummed talk laughter come see priest baiting vindication protestant religion though anthony looked round saw anxious downcast face unknown friend papists 
far easy mind 
studying campion ten reasons earnestly ever amazed find authorities dr jewel deferred namely scriptures interpreted fathers councils illustrated history exactly campion authorities jesuit appeal less confident protestant fact course suggested thought living authority existence decide two scholars christendom poor position 
doctors differed layman turn private judgment said protestant 
campion private judgment led submit catholic claim present weighed heavily anthony mind 
authority earth capable declaring revelation god first time beginning feel logical spiritual necessity infallible external judge matters faith catholic church system professed supply 
question existence authority doctrine justification one subjects continually men minds conversations anthony unlike others appeared fundamental even companion 
else seemed secondary 
indulgences mass absolution worship mary saints must stand fall god authority made known man 
one question authority certainly found came ringing tramp footsteps buzz talk ceased broke prisoners eyes bent upon surrounded strong guard pikemen seen advancing chapel north west door towards stools set ready 
anthony eyes campion limped front supported either side warder

pallor pain face chivalrous spirit looked called homage love years ago oxford made young men mockingly nicknamed leader desire praise passionately anything earth even imitate manners dress gait loyalty devotion 
anthony could take eyes watched clear cut profile face thrown fearlessly forward waited tense expectation hear speak paid attention whisperings chaplain beside 
presently debate began 
opened dean nowell high seat assured father campion disinterested motives reverend friends holding disputation 
priest demanded trusted god grace would good help see truth 
unfairness said dean seemed think apology needed taking thus unprepared since subject debate would none campion book 
jesuit looked nodded head smiled 
thank mr dean said deep resonant voice fell dead hush spoke 
thank desiring good take challenge must say would understood coming might made ready 
campion voice thrilled strangely anthony glance eyes done 
assured strong delicate instrument supremely owner command hardly less persuasive personality learning made apparent day 
anthony alone impressions jesuit 
lord arundel afterwards attributed conversion campion share discussions 
day murmur applause followed priest clean cut speeches arguments murmur disapproval fierce thrusts taunts opponents end day debate marked change attitude crowd come triumph papist manifest sympathy prisoners thought advisable exclude public subsequent discussions 
first day manner subjects touched upon comparative leniency catholic protestant governments position luther regard epistle st james matters comparatively unimportant discussion great deal time wasted 
campion entreated opponents leave minor questions alone come doctrinal matters preferred keep details rather principles priest scarcely opportunity state positive position 
doctrinal matter seriously touched upon justification faith texts flung fro without great result 
justified faith cried one side 
though faith charity nothing cried 
effect anthony day debate arose rather victorious personality priest arguments 
gaiety strange contrast solemn puritanism enemies 
instance point councils might err matters fact scriptures could 
example said eyes twinkling drawn face bound pain damnation believe toby dog tail written wagged 
deans looked sternly audience laughed 
said one becomes deal triflingly matters weight 
campion dropped eyes demurely reproved 
said example like take another 
must believe saint paul cloak willeth timothy bring 
crowd laughed anthony laughed strange sob throat gallant foolery much point deal deans saying 
second day debate held hopton hall vital matters anthony found leaning forward breathlessly drs goode fulke one side campion respectively attacked defended doctrine visible church anthony one crucial points dispute catholicism protestantism 
anthony believed already church one visible surely thought must visibly one case evident church found 
invisible may invisibly one far matter concerned may rest church england 
recoiled gulf opened 
must essential mark church said campion quality inseparable 
must visible fire hot water moist 
goode answered christ taken apostles fled least church invisible always church inchoate answered priest beginning perfect 
goode continued insist true church known god therefore invisible 
many wolves within said many sheep without 
know elect retorted campion know catholic 
elect church said goode 
say good evil visible church answered 
elect true members christ one thing went goode visible church another 
talk went anthony began see confusion lay 
protestants anxious prove membership visible body ensure salvation catholics never claimed question christ intend visible church membership normal though infallible means salvation presently got priori point whether visible church would seem necessity 
perpetual commandment said priest matthew eighteen tell church unless church visible ergo visibility church continual 
established church said goode remedy sought 
always 
disease continual answered campion ergo remedy must continual 
left priori ground entered 
gone cried luther time prelates made complaint unto days church nine hundred years ago whose john huss jerome prague waldenses turned scornfully fulke help master doctor 
fulke repeated goode assertion valuable remedy always 
anthony sat back puzzled 
sides seemed right 
persecution must often hinder full privileges church membership exercise discipline 
yet question christ intention church visible seemed even ministers allowed 
catholic claim christ intention never wholly frustrated visible unity found amongst surely easier believe protestant theory church visible fifteen centuries really church true church invisible spite christ intention period found small separated bodies scattered 
prevailing gates hell allowed true two clock reassembled afternoon conference got even closer heart matter subject whether church could err fulke asserted could made syllogism whatsoever error incident every member incident whole 
incident every member err ergo whole 
deny major minor said campion quietly 
every man may err whole gathered together whole hath promise hath every particular man 
fulke denied stoutly beat table 
every member hath spirit christ said spirit truth therefore hath promise whole hath 
said campion smiling heretics 
yes answered fulke heretics may within church church 
found back started 
anthony sat back oak bench sighed glanced round interested faces theologians yawns amateurs debate rolled old ground touched free grace infant baptism lieutenant interposed master doctors said judicial air question appointed dinner whether visible church may err goode retorted digressions campion fault 
debate took form contradictions 
whatsoever congregation doth err matters faith said goode true church church rome erreth matters faith ergo true church 
deny minor said campion church rome hath erred 
process repeated council trent debate whirled details irrelevancies imputed righteousness denial cup laity 
audience grew restless 
come listen theological minuti see sport interminable chopping words resulted nothing bored profoundly 
murmur conversation began buzz sides 
campion despair 
thus shall run questions cried hopelessly shall done time twelve months 
fulke would let pressed question council nice 
shall matter images sighed campion 
nimis acutus retorted fulke leap stile ever come 
mean speak images 
irrelevancies debate ended 
third debate september twenty third anthony present subject real presence blessed sacrament 
fulke evil temper since common talk campion best argument eighteenth 
day said hope conversion forbare much suffered discourse see obstinate heretic seek cover light truth multitude words mean allow large discourses 
imperious day answered campion serenely whatsoever matter 
queen prisoner none 
whit imperious said fulke angrily though exact keep right order disputation 
argument began 
soon became plain anthony possible take scripture two senses literally metaphorically 
sacrament either literally christ body 
decide father campion said meant one dr fulke 
could possible christ leave people doubt thing surely thought anthony 
well arbiter father campion says church dr fulke says scripture 
circular argument question decided scripture mean may mean least two things least would seem 
found face face claims church rome arbiter heart began grow sick apprehension saw church supplied exactly demanded circumstances case infallible living guide meaning god revelation 
simplicity claim appalled 
follow argument closely since seemed secondary question though heard one two sentences 
one point campion explaining church meant substance 
transcended senses 
dr fulke said 
yet see nothing color exterior form 
substance dr fulke seen 
vouchsafe reply upon answer snarled fulke whose temper improved debate childish sophister followed interminable syllogisms campion would accept premises real progress made 
jesuit tried explain doctrine wicked may said eat body sacrament receive virtue though receive thing fulke would hear 
distinction new anthony puritan training sat pondering debate passed 
afternoon discussion little purpose 
anthony others began see heart matter authority church unless settled debate beside point importance brought clearly ever th month fourth last debate took place subject sufficiency scriptures unto salvation 
mr charke succeeded disputant began extempore prayer usual priest refused join praying crossing apart 
mr walker opened disputation pompous insolent speech one campion unnatural man country degenerated englishman apostate religion fugitive realm unloyal prince 
campion sat eyes cast minister done 
discussion began 
priest pointed protestants even decided scriptures since luther rejected three epistles new testament therefore argued church necessary guide first tell men scripture 
walker evaded saying lutheran christian talk turned apocryphal books 
possible evade long jesuit soon touched opponent 
leave door traditions said holy ghost may deliver true church manifest seen baptism infants holy ghost proceeding father son things mentioned delivered tradition 
prove directly scripture charke answered analogy circumcision infants received quoting christ words sending comforter soon deep detailed argument anthony saw question interpretation scripture therefore would seem authoritative interpreter necessary could found save infallible living voice question campion drove point home 
scripture written apostles first taught charke dared answer yes 
afternoon debate concerned justification faith ever seemed anthony secondary matter realizing claim living authority meant sat back interested watching priest face controlled yet transparent simplicity steadfastness listened ministers brutal taunts insolence dealt quiet skilful parries ripostes incessant assaults 
last lieutenant struck table hand intimated time past long prayer mr walker prisoners led back cells 
anthony rode back alone evening sunlight one seeing vision 
indeed vision taking shape gradually detail detail last months ousting old one terribly emphasised campion arguments illuminated fire personality towered imperious consistent dominating across brow title catholic church 
far melting cloudland theory moved stupendous fact living contrast dead past enemies cried vain eloquent systems dumb authoritative hesitated steady reeled fell 
throne dwelt children every race age secure protection wise knowledge men faltered questioned doubted anthony looked saw first time recognized mistress mother soul although blinding clouds argument theory self distrust rushed filled eyes dust yet knew seen face truth memory vision could never wholly leave

papist bound say replied archbishop easy prophesy fulfilment may far away

mere angry raving say church england lose allegiance children 
anthony could feel convinced events bore archbishop assertion 
everywhere puritans becoming outrageously disloyal 
everywhere signs disaffection revolt authorities establishment even part sincere earnest men many looking forward day last rags popery cast away formal presbyterianism inaugurated church england 
episcopal ordination regarded merely civil requirement conveying ministerial commission recognition congregation laying hands presbyterate ordination allowed apostolic 
anthony said word archbishop
