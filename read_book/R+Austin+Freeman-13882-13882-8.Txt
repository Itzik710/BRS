far railway miles distant considerable town remains outpost civilization primitive manners customs old world tradition linger age elsewhere forgotten 
summer true small contingent visitors adventurous spirit though mostly sedate solitary habits make appearance swell meager population impart wide stretches smooth sand fringe shores fleeting air life sober gaiety late september season year made acquaintance pasture lands lie desolate rugged paths along cliffs seldom trodden human foot sands desert waste days together footprint appears save left passing sea bird 
assured medical agent mr turcival find practice taking charge exceedingly soft billet suitable studious man certainly misled patients fact quite concerned principal rather dull want work 
hence friend john thorndyke well known medico legal expert proposed come stay weekend perhaps days beyond hailed proposal delight welcomed open arms 
certainly seem overworked jervis remarked turned gate tea day arrival stroll shore 
new practice old one state senile decay fact answered virtually practice 
cooper principal six years private means never made serious effort build one man dr burrows uncommonly keen people conservative cooper never really got foot 
however seem trouble 
well satisfied suppose said thorndyke smile 
getting seaside holiday paid 
know near sea 
entering spoke artificial gap way cut low cliff forming steep cart track shore 
locally known sundersley gap used principally used farmers carts came gather seaweed gale 
magnificent stretch sand continued thorndyke reached bottom stood looking seaward across deserted beach 
something majestic solemn great expanse sandy shore tide know nothing capable conveying impression solitude completely 
smooth unbroken surface displays untenanted moment offers convincing testimony lain thus undisturbed considerable lapse time 
instance clear evidence several days two pairs feet besides trodden gap 
arrive several days asked 
simplest manner possible replied 
moon third quarter tides consequently neap tides 
see quite plainly two lines seaweed jetsam indicate high water marks spring tides neap tides respectively 
strip comparatively dry sand water risen several days see marked two sets footprints footprints completely obliterated sea next spring tide nearly week day 
yes see thing appears obvious enough one heard explanation 
really rather odd one passed gap days four persons come within quite short interval one another 
makes think done thorndyke asked 
well replied sets footprints appear quite fresh made time 
time jervis rejoined thorndyke 
certainly interval several hours though precisely many hours judge since little wind lately disturb fisherman unquestionably passed three hours ago say probably within hour whereas man seems come boat fetch something considerable weight returned gap certainly less probably four hours ago 
gazed friend blank astonishment events befell days joined assistant special knowledge powers inference fully appreciated 
clear thorndyke said footprints different meaning 
see least reached conclusions 
suppose reply see special knowledge kind stock trade medical jurist acquired special study though present example one greatest simplicity 
let us consider point point first take set footprints inferred fisherman note enormous size 
footprints giant 
length stride shows made rather short man 
observe massiveness soles fact nails 
note also peculiar clumsy tread deep toe heel marks walker wooden legs fixed ankles knees 
character safely infer high boots thick rigid leather diagnose high boots massive stiff nailless soles many sizes large wearer 
boot answers description fisherman thigh boot made enormous size enable wear winter two three pairs thick knitted stockings one 
look footprints double track see one set coming sea one going towards 
man bow legged turned toes trodden footprints obvious came sea returned 
observe difference two sets prints returning ones much deeper others stride much shorter 
evidently carrying something returned something heavy 
moreover see greater depth toe impressions stooping forward walked probably carried weight back 
quite clear perfectly replied 
arrive interval time visits two men also quite simple 
tide halfway thus three hours since high water 
fisherman walked neap tide high water mark sometimes sometimes 
none footprints obliterated therefore passed high water less three hours ago since footprints equally distinct could passed sand wet 
therefore probably passed less hour ago 
man footprints hand reach neap tide high water mark end abruptly 
sea washed remainder tracks obliterated 
therefore passed less three hours four days ago probably within twenty four hours 
thorndyke concluded demonstration sound voices borne us mingled tramping feet immediately afterwards singular party appeared head gap descending towards shore 
first came short burly fisherman clad oilskins sou wester clumping along awkwardly great sea boots local police sergeant company professional rival dr burrows rear procession brought two constables carrying stretcher 
reached bottom gap fisherman evidently acting guide turned along shore retracing tracks procession followed wake 
surgeon stretcher two constables police sergeant observed thorndyke 
suggest mind jervis fall cliff replied body washed shore 
probably rejoined may well walk direction 
turned follow retreating procession strode along smooth surface left retiring tide thorndyke resumed subject footprints always interested deeply two reasons 
first evidence furnished footprints constantly brought forward often cardinal importance secondly whole subject capable really systematic scientific treatment 
main data anatomical age sex occupation health disease give various indications 
clearly instance footprints old man differ young man height need point person suffering locomotor ataxia paralysis agitans would quite unmistakable 
yes see plainly enough said 
continued case point 
halted point stick row footprints appeared suddenly high water mark proceeded short distance crossed line vanished waves washed 
easily distinguished others clear impressions circular rubber heels 
see anything remarkable asked 
notice considerably deeper answered 
yes boots size whereas stride considerably shorter quite short stride fact 
pretty constant ratio length foot length leg length leg height person stature length stride 
long foot means long leg tall man long stride 
long foot short stride 
make laid stick smooth partridge cane one side marked small lines inches feet beside footprints demonstrate discrepancy 
depth footprints shows much heavier man either us suggested perhaps unusually fat 
yes said thorndyke seems explanation 
carrying dead weight shortens stride fat practically dead weight 
conclusion five feet ten inches high excessively fat 
picked cane resumed walk keeping eye procession ahead disappeared round curve coast line mended pace somewhat 
presently reached small headland turning shoulder cliff came full upon party preceded us 
men halted narrow bay stood looking prostrate figure beside surgeon kneeling 
wrong see observed thorndyke 
fallen cliff washed sea 
lying high water mark footprints examining appear 
approached sergeant turned held hand 
ask walk round body gentlemen said 
seems foul play want clear tracks anyone crosses 
acknowledging caution advanced constables standing looked curiosity dead man 
tall frail looking man thin point emaciation appeared thirty five years age 
lay easy posture half closed eyes placid expression contrasted strangely enough tragic circumstances death 
clear case murder said dr burrows dusting sand knees stood 
deep knife wound heart must caused death almost instantaneously 
long say dead doctor asked sergeant

sergeant stepped mr bashfield announced case prosecution 
resumed seat turning inquisitive eye anstey thorndyke 
former immediately rose opened case defense brief statement 
learned counsel prosecution said told us facts possession court admit one explanation guilt accused 
may may shall proceed lay court certain fresh facts facts may say singular startling character think lead different conclusion 
shall say call witnesses forthwith let evidence speak 
first witness defense thorndyke entered box observed polton take position close behind large wicker trunk 
sworn requested anstey tell court knew case commenced without preamble half past four afternoon th september walked sundersley gap dr jervis 
attention attracted certain footprints sand particularly man landed boat walked gap presently returned apparently boat 
standing sergeant payne dr burrows passed gap two constables carrying stretcher 
followed distance walked along shore encountered another set footprints sergeant described footprints deceased 
examined carefully endeavored frame description person made 
description agree characters deceased magistrate asked 
least replied thorndyke whereupon magistrate inspector mr bashfield laughed long heartily 
turned st bridget bay saw body deceased lying sand close cliff 
sand round covered footprints prolonged fierce struggle taken place 
two sets footprints one set apparently deceased man nailed shoes peculiar conspicuous pattern 
incredible folly wearing shoes indicated caused look closely footprints made surprising discovery reality struggle fact two sets footprints made different times 
different times magistrate exclaimed astonishment 
yes 
interval may one hours one seconds undoubted fact two sets footprints made simultaneously succession 
arrive fact magistrate asked 
obvious one looked said thorndyke 
marks deceased man shoes showed repeatedly trod footprints never single instance tread footprints man although covered area 
man nailed shoes contrary trod footprints equal frequency deceased 
moreover body removed observed footprints sand lying exclusively deceased 
sign nail marked footprint corpse although many close around 
evident therefore footprints deceased made first nailed shoes afterwards 
thorndyke paused magistrate rubbed nose thoughtfully inspector gazed witness puzzled frown 
singularity fact colleague resumed made look footprints yet critically made another discovery 
double track nailed shoes leading apparently back shepherd path 
examining tracks closely astonished find man made walking backwards fact walked backwards body shepherd path ascended short distance turned round returned still walking backwards face cliff near corpse tracks vanished altogether 
sand spot small inconspicuous marks might made end rope also small fragments fallen cliff 
observing examined surface cliff one spot six feet beach found freshly rubbed spot parallel scratches might made nailed sole boot 
ascended shepherd path examined cliff found extreme edge rather deep indentation would made taut rope lying looking could see five feet top another rubbed spot distinct parallel scratches 
appear infer said chairman man performed astonishing evolutions hauled cliff appearances suggested replied thorndyke 
chairman pursed lips raised eyebrows glanced doubtfully brother magistrates 
resigned air bowed witness indicate listening 
night thorndyke resumed cycled shore gap supply plaster paris proceeded take plaster moulds important footprints 
magistrates inspector mr bashfield one accord sat attention sergeant payne swore quite audibly experienced sudden illumination respecting certain basin kitchen spoon puzzled night thorndyke arrival 
thought liquid plaster might confuse even obliterate prints sand filled respective footprints dry plaster pressed lightly cautiously poured water 
moulds excellent impressions course show appearance boots made footprints moulds prepared casts reproduce footprints 
first mould made one tracks boat gap shall speak presently 
next made mould one footprints described deceased 
described exclaimed chairman 
deceased certainly footprints must flown found 
call footprints deceased replied thorndyke imperturbably 
took mould one mould one footprints 
mould cast 
turned took triumphant polton tenderly lifted trunk readiness 
looking cast seen appearances would expected 
deceased five feet nine inches high thin light weighing nine stone six pounds ascertained weighing body whereas five feet eleven weigh nearly thirteen stone 
yet footprint deceased nearly twice deep mine say lighter man sunk sand nearly twice deeply heavier man 
magistrates deeply attentive 
longer simply listening despised utterances mere scientific expert 
cast lay two footprints side side evidence appealed senses proportionately convincing 
singular said chairman perhaps explain discrepancy think replied thorndyke prefer place facts first 
undoubtedly would better chairman agreed 
pray proceed 
another remarkable peculiarity footprints thorndyke continued distance apart length stride fact 
measured steps carefully heel heel found nineteen half inches 
man hearn height would ordinary stride thirty six inches walking fast 
walking stride nineteen half inches would look legs tied together 
next proceeded bay took two moulds footprints man nailed shoes right left 
cast mould shows clearly man walking backwards 
show asked magistrate 
several distinctive points 
instance absence usual kick toe slight drag behind heel showing direction foot lifted undisturbed impression sole 
spoken moulds casts 
difference mould direct therefore reversed impression 
cast impression mould therefore facsimile object 
pour liquid plaster coin sets mould sunk impression coin 
pour melted wax mould obtain cast facsimile coin 
footprint mould foot 
mould footprint cast foot cast mould reproduces footprint 
thank said magistrate 
moulds two footprints really facsimiles murderer shoes compared shoes put evidence yes compare demonstrate important fact 
prisoner shoes shoes made footprints 
buzz astonishment ran court thorndyke continued stolidly prisoner shoes possession went barker pond clay margin seen footprints actually made prisoner 
took moulds footprints compared sand 
several important differences see compare 
facilitate comparison made transparent photographs sets moulds scale 
put photograph mould prisoner right shoe murderer right shoe hold two superposed photographs light make two pictures coincide 
exactly length shoes different shape 
moreover put one nails one photograph corresponding nail photograph make rest nails coincide 
conclusive fact possible escape number nails two shoes 
sole prisoner right shoe forty nails murderer forty one 
murderer one nail many 
deathly silence court magistrates mr bashfield pored moulds prisoner shoes examined photographs light 
chairman asked facts something tell us evidently anxious get key riddle 
evidence worship said anstey 
witness examined body deceased 
turning thorndyke asked present post mortem examination 
form opinion cause death yes 
came conclusion death occasioned overdose morphia 
universal gasp amazement greeted statement 
presiding magistrate protested breathlessly wound told capable causing instantaneous death 
case undoubtedly wound replied thorndyke 
wound inflicted deceased already dead quarter half hour 
incredible exclaimed magistrate 
doubt give us reasons amazing conclusion opinion said thorndyke based several facts 
first place wound inflicted living body gapes rather widely owing retraction living skin 
skin dead body retract wound consequently gape 
wound gaped slightly showing death recent say within half hour 
wound living body becomes filled blood blood shed freely clothing 
wound deceased contained little blood clot 
hardly blood clothing already noticed none sand body lain 
consider quite conclusive magistrate asked doubtfully 
answered thorndyke 
evidence beyond question 
weapon partially divided aorta pulmonary artery main arteries body 
life great vessels full blood high internal pressure whereas death become almost empty 
follows wound inflicted life cavity vessels lie would become filled blood 
matter fact contained practically blood merest oozing small veins certain wound inflicted death 
presence nature poison ascertained analyzing certain secretions body analysis enabled judge quantity poison large contents stomach sent professor copland exact examination 
result professor copland analysis known magistrate asked anstey 
professor worship replied anstey prepared swear obtained one grain morphia contents stomach poisonous dose unabsorbed residue actually swallowed total quantity taken must large indeed 
thank said magistrate 
dr thorndyke given us facts perhaps tell us conclusions drawn 
facts stated said thorndyke appear indicate following sequence events 
deceased died midnight september effects poisonous dose morphia administered offer opinion 
think body conveyed boat sundersley gap 
boat probably contained three men one remained charge one walked gap along cliff towards st bridget bay third put shoes deceased carried body along shore bay 
would account great depth short stride tracks spoken deceased 
reached bay believe man laid corpse tracks trampled sand neighborhood 
next took deceased shoes put corpse put pair boots shoes carrying perhaps hung round neck prepared nails imitate draper shoes 
shoes trampled area near corpse 
walked backwards shepherd path still backwards face cliff 
accomplice lowered rope climbed top 
top took nailed shoes two men walked back gap man carried rope took confederate back carried boat avoid leaving tracks stockinged feet 
tracks saw gap certainly indicated man carrying something heavy returned boat 
man climbed rope cliff could walked shepherd path magistrate asked 
replied thorndyke would set tracks leading bay without corresponding set leading would instantly suggested smart police officer sergeant payne landing boat 
explanation highly ingenious said magistrate appears cover remarkable facts

thorndyke ascertained fact door burst open mrs haldean entered room followed mrs hanshaw police inspector 
former lady regarded colleague glance extreme disfavor 
heard come sir said supposed engaged searching poor child 
seems mistaken since find amusing fiddling nonsensical instruments 
perhaps mabel said mrs hanshaw stiffly would wiser infinitely polite ask dr thorndyke news us 
undoubtedly madam agreed inspector apparently suffered also mrs haldean impulsiveness 
perhaps latter lady suggested inform us discovered anything 
tell 
replied thorndyke know 
child abducted man occupied house appears watched upper window probably glass 
man lured child wood blowing bird call met wood induced promises doubt come 
picked child carried back think house brought front door locked 
gave boy clock bird call amuse went upstairs packed trunk 
took trunk back door garden shed motor car

knobbed stick artificial limb puzzled completely presently overtook thorndyke demand explanation 
stick said perfectly simple 
ferrule knobbed stick wears evenly round crooked stick wears one side side opposite crook 
impressions showed ferrule one evenly convex therefore crook 
matter complicated 
begin artificial foot makes characteristic impression owing purely passive elasticity show morrow 
artificial leg fitted knee quite secure whereas one fitted knee artificial knee joint worked spring much less reliable 
man artificial foot evidently distrusted knee joint shown steadying stick side 
merely weak leg would used stick right hand natural swing arm fact unless lame evidently 
still question probability though probability great

therefore expect experts translate document translation transliteration mere farrago unintelligible nonsense

matter said length handing dagger back inspector refers houses opposite 
walked window looked backs row tall buildings similar one 
thirty yards distant separated us piece ground planted shrubs intersected gravel paths 
rooms occupied last night continued thorndyke might obtain actual eyewitness crime 
room brilliantly lighted blinds observer windows could see right room distinctly 
might worth inquiring 
yes true said inspector though expect seen anything come forward quick enough read report papers

beckoned mr curtis inspector departed police surgeon induced porter let us garden 
question asked mr marchmont began looking curiously tall houses opposite simply answered 
person immediately interested death alfred hartridge executor sole legatee man named leonard wolfe 
relation deceased merely friend inherits entire estate twenty thousand pounds 
circumstances alfred hartridge elder two brothers younger charles died father leaving widow three children 
fifteen years ago father died leaving whole property alfred understanding support brother family make children heirs 
asked thorndyke 
great pressure friends son widow old man made shortly died old rather childish contested alfred grounds undue influence ultimately set aside 
since alfred hartridge paid penny towards support brother family 
client mr curtis might starved whole burden support widow education children fallen upon 
well lately matter assumed acute form two reasons 
first charles eldest son edmund come age 
mr curtis articled solicitor fully qualified advantageous proposal partnership made putting pressure alfred supply necessary capital accordance father wishes 
refused reference matter calling morning 
second reason involves curious disgraceful story 
certain leonard wolfe intimate friend deceased 
may say man bad character association kind creditable neither 
also certain woman named hester greene certain claims upon deceased need go present 
leonard wolfe deceased alfred hartridge entered agreement terms wolfe marry hester greene consideration service alfred hartridge assign wolfe whole property absolutely actual transfer take place death hartridge 
transaction completed asked thorndyke 
yes unfortunately 
wished see anything could done widow children hartridge lifetime 
doubt client daughter miss curtis called last night similar mission indiscreetly since matter hands know engaged edmund hartridge expect interview pretty stormy one 
thorndyke remained silent pacing slowly along gravel path eyes bent ground abstractedly however searching attentive glance roved amongst shrubs bushes though looking something 
sort man asked presently leonard wolfe obviously low scoundrel like respects fool instance say said mr curtis 
formerly engineer believe capable mechanician 
latterly lived property came spent time money gambling dissipation 
consequently expect pretty short funds present

hair replied thorndyke hair murderer 
placed hand corpse obvious purpose fact murderer brought shows crime premeditated committed someone access house acquainted inmates 
thorndyke made statement coroner jurymen spectators alike gazed open mouthed amazement 
interval intense silence broken wild hysteric laugh mrs goldstein coroner asked know hair hand corpse murderer inference obvious 
first glance peculiar conspicuous color hair struck suspicious 
three facts sufficient prove hair probably murderer 
first place condition hand 
person moment death grasps object firmly set condition known cadaveric spasm 
muscular contraction passes immediately rigor mortis death stiffening object remains grasped dead hand rigidity passes 
case hand perfectly rigid grasp hair 
little tress lay palm quite loosely hand partially closed 
obviously hair placed death 
two facts reference condition hair 
lock hair torn head evident roots found end lock 
present instance case lock hair lay dead woman hand roots ends could torn head murderer 
third fact observed still conclusive 
hairs little tress composed pulled 
fallen spontaneously 
fact shed hairs probably combings 
let explain difference 
hair shed naturally drops little tube skin called root sheath pushed young hair growing underneath root end shed hair shows nothing small bulbous enlargement root bulb 
hair forcibly pulled root drags root sheath plainly seen glistening mass end hair 
miriam goldstein pull hair pass show great difference hair pulled hair shed
