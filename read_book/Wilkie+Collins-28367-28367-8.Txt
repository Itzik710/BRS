cornish essentially cheerful contented race 
views working men remarkably moderate sensible never met grumblers anywhere 
opportunities correctly estimating state education among people sufficiently numerous justify offering reader mere opinion subject 
observations able make inclined think education mass population certainly average england one exception classes employed mines 
men held communication would considered badly informed persons higher condition life

small farmer living one western districts county died years back supposed time english cholera 
weeks decease wife married 
circumstance excited attention neighborhood 
remembered woman lived bad terms late husband many occasions exhibited strong symptoms possessing vindictive temper farmer lifetime openly manifested rather platonic preference man subsequently married 
suspicion generally excited people began doubt whether first husband died fairly

examination enough arsenic poisoned three men found stomach 
wife accused murdering tried convicted clearest evidence hanged
