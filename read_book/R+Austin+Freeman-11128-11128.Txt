facts lay dr thorndyke known world time morrow occasion show secrecy 
case said thorndyke let us draw chairs fire fall business forthwith 
finished dinner waiting coffee hear man bringing moment 
accordingly drew chairs polton set coffee table retired lawyer plunged matter without preamble 
chapter ii suspect better said give general outline case presents legal mind client mr reuben hornby fill details necessary answer questions may wish put 
mr reuben occupies position trust business uncle john hornby gold silver refiner dealer precious metals generally 
certain amount outside assay work carried establishment main business consists testing refining samples gold sent certain mines south africa 
five years ago mr reuben cousin walter another nephew john hornby left school articled uncle view ultimately becoming partners house remained ever since occupying said positions considerable responsibility 
words business conducted mr hornby establishment 
samples gold handed docks accredited representative firm generally either mr reuben mr walter despatched meet ship conveyed either bank works according circumstances 
course every effort made little gold possible premises bars always removed bank earliest opportunity happens unavoidably samples considerable value often remain premises night works furnished large powerful safe strong room reception 
safe situated private office eye principal additional precaution caretaker acts night watchman occupies room directly office patrols building periodically night 
strange thing occurred regard safe 
happens one mr hornby customers south africa interested diamond mine although transactions precious stones form part business house time time sent parcels rough diamonds addressed mr hornby either deposited bank handed diamond brokers 
fortnight ago mr hornby advised parcel stones despatched elmina castle appeared parcel unusually large one contained stones exceptional size value 
circumstances mr reuben sent docks early hour hope ship might arrive time stones lodged bank 
unfortunately however case diamonds taken works locked safe 
placed safe asked thorndyke 
mr hornby mr reuben delivered package return docks 
yes said thorndyke happened next well following morning safe opened diamonds disappeared 
place broken asked thorndyke 

place locked usual caretaker made accustomed rounds heard nothing safe outwardly quite undisturbed 
evidently opened keys locked stones removed 
whose custody keys safe inquired thorndyke 
mr hornby usually kept keys occasions absent office handed one nephews whichever happened charge time 
occasion keys go custody time locked safe depositing diamonds time opened following morning 
anything tended throw suspicion upon anyone asked thorndyke 
yes said mr lawley uncomfortable glance client unfortunately 
seemed person abstracted diamonds must cut scratched thumb finger way two drops blood bottom safe one two bloody smears piece paper addition remarkably clear imprint thumb 
also blood asked thorndyke 
yes 
thumb apparently put one drops still wet blood pressed paper taking hold otherwise 
well next well said lawyer fidgeting chair make long story short thumb print identified mr reuben hornby 
ha exclaimed thorndyke 
plot thickens vengeance 
better jot notes proceed 
took drawer small paper covered notebook cover wrote reuben hornby laying book open blotting pad rested knee made brief notes 
said finished reference thumb print 
doubt suppose identification none whatever replied mr lawley 
scotland yard people course took possession paper handed director finger print department examination comparison collection 
report experts thumb print agree thumb prints criminals possession peculiar one inasmuch ridge pattern bulb thumb remarkably distinct characteristic one crossed scar deep cut rendering identification easy infallible agrees every respect thumb print mr reuben hornby fact thumb print beyond possible doubt 
possibility asked thorndyke paper bearing thumb print could introduced person answered lawyer 
quite impossible 
paper mark found leaf mr hornby memorandum block 
pencilled particulars relating diamonds laid parcel closed safe 
anyone present mr hornby opened safe morning asked thorndyke 
alone answered lawyer 
saw glance diamonds missing observed paper thumb mark closed locked safe sent police 
rather odd thief notice thumb mark since distinct conspicuous think answered mr lawley 
paper lying face downwards bottom safe picked turned mr hornby discovered thumb print 
apparently thief taken hold parcel paper paper afterwards dropped fallen marked surface downwards probably parcel transferred hand 
mentioned said thorndyke experts scotland yard identified thumb mark mr reuben hornby 
may ask came opportunity making comparison ah said mr lawley 
thereby hangs curious tale coincidences 
police course found simple means identification thumb mark wished take thumb prints employees works mr hornby refused sanction rather quixotically seems saying would allow nephews subjected indignity 
naturally nephews police chiefly interested seeing alone handling keys considerable pressure brought bear upon mr hornby thumb prints taken 
however obdurate scouting idea suspicion attaching either gentlemen reposed complete confidence known lives matter would probably remained mystery odd circumstance 
may seen bookstalls shop windows appliance called thumbograph name consisting small book blank paper collecting thumb prints one friends together inking pad 
seen devices evil one said thorndyke fact one bought charing cross station 
well seems months ago mrs hornby wife john hornby purchased one toys matter fact interrupted reuben cousin walter bought thing gave 
well material said mr lawley though observed thorndyke made note fact book rate mrs hornby became possessed one appliances proceeded fill thumb prints friends including two nephews 
happened detective charge case called yesterday mr hornby house latter absent home took opportunity urging induce husband consent thumb prints nephews taken inspection experts scotland yard 
pointed procedure really necessary interests justice interests young men regarded considerable suspicion police suspicion would completely removed could shown actual comparison thumb print could made either 
moreover seemed young men expressed willingness test applied forbidden uncle 
mrs hornby brilliant idea 
suddenly remembered thumbograph thinking set question rest fetched little book showed detective 
contained prints thumbs mr reuben among others detective photograph incriminating mark comparison made may imagine mrs hornby horror amazement made clear print nephew reuben left thumb corresponded every particular thumb print found safe 
juncture mr hornby arrived scene course overwhelmed consternation turn events taken 
would liked let matter drop make good loss diamonds funds would amounted practically compounding felony choice prosecute 
result warrant issued arrest mr reuben executed morning client taken forthwith bow street charged robbery

recommended plead guilty throw clemency court first offender 
must see defense possible 
young man flushed crimson made remark 
let us clear stand said thorndyke 
defending innocent man endeavoring obtain light sentence man admits guilty mr lawley shrugged shoulders 
question best answered client said 
thorndyke directed inquiring glance reuben hornby remarking called upon incriminate way mr hornby must know position intend adopt 
proposed withdraw reuben interrupted 
need go away dr jervis said 
position commit robbery know nothing whatever thumb print found safe 
course expect believe face overwhelming evidence nevertheless declare solemn manner god absolutely innocent crime knowledge whatever 
take plead guilty said thorndyke 
certainly never replied reuben hotly 
would first innocent man many entered plea remarked mr lawley 
often best policy defense hopelessly weak 
policy adopted rejoined reuben 
may probably shall convicted sentenced shall continue maintain innocence whatever happens 
think added turning thorndyke undertake defense assumption assumption agree undertake case replied thorndyke 
may ask question pursued reuben anxiously find possible conceive may really innocent certainly thorndyke replied observed mr lawley eyebrows rise perceptibly 
man facts advocate found impossible entertain hypothesis innocence willing expend time energy searching evidence prove 
nevertheless continued seeing light hope break face unfortunate young man must impress upon case presents enormous difficulties must prepared find insuperable spite efforts 
expect nothing conviction replied reuben calm resolute voice face like man take guilt granted give chance matter small making defense

special bearing case supposing supposition replied mr hornby actual pecuniary difficulties date robbery seems possible construct hypothesis identity robber 
like hear hypothesis stated said thorndyke rousing regarding lively interest 
highly improbable one began natural shyness idea airing wits master inductive method fact almost fantastic 
never mind said 
sound thinker gives equal consideration probable improbable 
thus encouraged proceeded set forth theory crime occurred way home fog gratified observe close attention thorndyke listened little nods approval point made 
finished remained silent time looking thoughtfully fire evidently considering theory new facts based would fit rest data 
length spoke without however removing eyes red embers theory jervis great credit ingenuity 
may disregard improbability seeing alternative theories almost equally improbable fact emerges gratifies tell gifted enough scientific imagination construct possible train events 
indeed improbability combined course possibility really adds achievement dullest mind perceive obvious instance importance finger print 
really done great thing congratulate emancipated least extent great finger print obsession possessed legal mind ever since galton published epoch making monograph 
work remember states finger print affords evidence requiring corroboration dangerous misleading statement fastened upon eagerly police naturally delighted obtaining sort magic touchstone saved labor investigation 
thing single fact affords evidence requiring corroboration 
well might one expect make syllogism single premise 
suppose would hardly go far said laughing 
admitted 
kind syllogism make crime committed person made finger print 
john smith person made finger print 
therefore crime committed john smith 
well perfectly good syllogism asked 
perfectly replied 
see begs whole question crime committed person made finger print corroboration required 
practically leaves case investigated without reference finger print thus becomes importance 
rejoined thorndyke finger print valuable clue long evidential value exaggerated 
take present case instance 
without thumb print robbery might committed anybody clue whatever 
existence thumb print narrows inquiry reuben person access finger prints 
yes see 
consider theory john hornby perpetrator robbery quite tenable one quite replied thorndyke 
entertained first new facts gathered increase probability 
remember said four hypotheses possible robbery committed either reuben walter john hornby person 
putting aside person consideration first three hypotheses fail left reuben walter john 
leave thumb print question probabilities evidently point john hornby since admittedly access diamonds whereas nothing show others 
thumb print however transfers suspicion reuben yet theory makes evident completely clear john hornby 
case stands balance probabilities may stated thus john hornby undoubtedly access diamonds therefore might stolen 
thumb mark made closed safe opened person must access probably thief 
thumb mark reuben hornby fact establishes prima facie probability stole diamonds 
evidence access could made thumb mark manner time stated 
john hornby may access previously made thumb mark reuben may possibly obtained case almost certainly thief 
walter hornby may means obtaining reuben thumb mark evidence access either diamonds mr hornby memorandum block 
prima facie probabilities case therefore slight 
actual points issue said whether reuben means opening safe whether mr hornby ever actually opportunity obtaining reuben thumb mark blood memorandum block 
yes replied thorndyke 
points others likely remain unsettled 
reuben rooms searched police failed find skeleton duplicate keys proves nothing would probably made away heard thumb mark found 
matter asked reuben recollection ever made thumb mark blood 
matter rests 
mr hornby liability diamonds think may dismiss answered thorndyke 
undertaken liability negligence 
would liable law 
colleague retired quite early sat long time pondering upon singular case found involved 
thought puzzled became 
thorndyke satisfactory explanation offer given evening defense hopeless court likely accept estimate evidential value finger prints 
yet given reuben something like positive assurance would adequate defense expressed positive conviction accused man innocence 
thorndyke man reach conviction merely sentimental considerations 
inevitable conclusion something sleeve gained possession facts escaped observation reached point knocked pipe betook bed 
chapter ix prisoner following morning emerged room met polton coming tray bedrooms attic floor laboratory workshop accordingly followed friend chamber

misfortunes proverbially sociable juliet remarked reference adopted uncle 
trouble reuben enough worries city 
perhaps heard 
replied walter mentioned matter 
yes said juliet rather viciously quite clear part good gentleman played matter 
come quite accidentally large holding mines seems cut loss phrase goes got though managed pay large differences understand 
think must raised money somehow 
know mines began depreciate asked 
yes quite sudden affair walter calls slump occurred days robbery 
mr hornby telling yesterday recalled ridiculous accident happened day 
inquired 
cut finger nearly fainted answered shamefaced little laugh 
rather bad cut know notice found hand covered blood 
turned suddenly faint lie hearthrug mr hornby study tidying time 
found reuben dreadful fright gave first tore handkerchief tie wounded finger never saw awful mess got hands 
might arrested murderer poor boy condition 
make professional gorge rise learn fastened extemporised bandage red tape got writing table rooting among sacred papers ruthless fashion 
gone tried put things table straight really might thought horrible crime committed envelopes papers smeared blood marked print gory fingers 
remembered afterwards reuben thumb mark identified thought perhaps one papers might got safe accident mr hornby told impossible tore leaf memorandum block time put away diamonds 
gist conversation cab rattled streets way prison certainly contained matter sufficiently important draw away thoughts subjects agreeable less relevant case 
sudden remembrance duty drew forth notebook act committing statements writing thorndyke entered room 
let interrupt jervis said 
make cup tea finish writing shall exhibit day catch hang nets dry 
long finishing notes fever impatience hear thorndyke comments latest addition store information 
time kettle boiling entries completed proceeded forthwith retail colleague extracts conversation juliet recorded 
listened usual deep critical attention 
interesting important said finished really jervis invaluable coadjutor 
seems information would strictly withheld forbidding jorkins trickles freely unasked ear genial spenlow 
suppose regard hypothesis received substantial confirmation certainly 
justifiably 
see completely right allowed entertain theory crime spite apparent improbability 
light new facts become quite probable explanation whole affair could shown mr hornby memorandum block among papers table would rise high degree probability 
obvious moral never disregard improbable 
way odd reuben failed recall occurrence questioned 
course bloody finger marks discovered gone one would expected recall circumstance asked pointedly never left bloody finger prints papers 
must try find mr hornby memorandum block table among marked papers said 
yes would wise answered though suppose information forthcoming 
colleague manner rather disappointed 
heard report greatest attention discussed animation yet seemed attach new appeared highly important facts interest academic rather practical 
course calmness might assumed seem likely john thorndyke far sincere dignified character cultivate private life artifices actor 
strangers indeed presented habitually calm impassive exterior natural outward sign even judicial habit mind 
doubt startling news left unmoved must one two reasons either already knew told perfectly possible better means explaining crime 
turning two alternatives unobserved watchful colleague polton entered room broad grin face drawing board carried like tray bore twenty four neatly turned boxwood pieces 
thorndyke entered unspoken jest beamed countenance subordinate 
polton problem jervis said 
assumes invented new parlor game trying work moves 
succeeded yet polton sir suspect one players man wig gown 
perhaps right said thorndyke take far 
let us hear dr jervis say 
make nothing answered 
polton showed drawing morning terrified lest committed breach confidence trying ever since without glimmer success guess 
h grunted thorndyke sauntered room teacup hand guess eh like word guess mouth man science 
mean guess manner wholly facetious professed take question seriously replied guess mean conclusion arrived without data 
impossible exclaimed mock sternness 
nobody utter fool arrives conclusion without data 
must revise definition instantly rejoined 
let us say guess conclusion drawn insufficient facts 
better said perhaps would better still say guess particular definite conclusion deduced facts properly yield general indefinite one 
let us take instance continued 
looking window see man walking round paper buildings 
suppose say fashion inspired detective romances man stationmaster inspector would guess 
observed facts yield conclusion though warrant conclusion less definite general 
right though sir exclaimed polton stepped forward examine unconscious subject demonstration 
gent used stationmaster camberwell 
remember well 
little man evidently greatly impressed 
happen right see said thorndyke might easily wrong 
though sir said polton 
spotted glance 
admiration result cared fig correctness means attained 
suggest stationmaster pursued thorndyke disregarding assistant comment 
suppose looking feet answered 
seem noticed peculiar splay footed gait stationmasters mention 
quite 
arch foot given way plantar ligaments become stretched deep calf muscles weakened 
since bending weakened arch causes discomfort feet become turned outwards bending foot reduced minimum left foot flattened turned right 
turning toes causes legs splay outward knees downwards conspicuous condition tall man like one notice left leg splays 
know depression arch foot brought standing long periods 
continuous pressure living structure weakens intermittent pressure strengthens man stands feet continuously develops flat instep weak calf professional dancer runner acquires high instep strong calf 
many occupations involve prolonged standing induce condition flat foot waiters hall porters hawkers policemen shop walkers salesmen station officials examples 
waiter gait characteristic quick shuffling walk enables carry liquids without spilling 
man walks long swinging stride obviously waiter 
dress appearance general exclude idea hawker even hall porter man poor physique policeman 
shop walker salesman accustomed move relatively confined spaces acquires short brisk step dress tends rather exuberant smartness station official patrols long platforms often rapid pace tends take long strides dress dignified neat rather florid 
last mentioned characteristics see appear subject analysis agrees general description stationmaster 
therefore conclude stationmaster fall time honored fallacy undistributed middle term fallacy haunts brilliant guessers including detective romance often also real life 
observed facts justify us inferring man engaged mode life necessitates good deal standing rest mere guess work 
wonderful said polton gazing distant figure perfectly wonderful 
never known stationmaster 
glance deep admiration employer took departure 
also observe said thorndyke smile fortunate guess often brings credit piece sound reasoning less striking result 
yes unfortunately case certainly true present instance 
reputation far polton concerned firmly established even 
eyes wizard nothing hidden 
return little pieces must call lack better name 
form hypothesis use 
seem departure nautical phrase goes start inquiry 
even material guess work 
ought able arrive opinion subject thorndyke picked one pieces fingering delicately inspecting critical eye flat base stood reflected moments 
easy trace connection one knows facts said length seems materials form conjecture 
perhaps wrong think experience find able work problem kind 
required constructive imagination rigorous exactness reasoning 
good reasoner recently shown necessary imagination merely lack experience use faculties 
learn purpose things made long probably surprised use occur 
let us go forth take brisk walk refresh perhaps say day labor 
chapter xi ambush going ask collaboration another case said thorndyke day two later 
appears one suicide solicitors griffin office asked go place neighborhood barnet present post mortem inquest 
managed arrange inquest shall take place directly post mortem shall able whole business single visit

thorndyke chuckled indulgently

see chilly miserable poor devils passengers look

half dozen number roughs hooligan type evidently boisterous spirits passed entrance royal free hospital halted battered furiously gate

let draw ahead said 
wise precaution give hooligan gangs wide berth time night 
better turn heathcote street cross mecklenburgh square 
continued walk reduced speed reached heathcote street turned entered mecklenburgh square mended pace 
hooligan pursued thorndyke walked briskly across silent square covers multitude sins ranging highway robbery violence paid assassination technically known bashing criminal folly philanthropic magistrate seems think function economy nature secure survival unfittest 
goes cyclist along guildford street 
wonder strenuous friend station 
slipped past hooligans 
entering doughty street thorndyke spoke man bicycle visible instant crossing two streets 
reached guildford street looked long lamp lighted vista cyclist vanished 
better go straight theobald road said thorndyke accordingly pursued way fine old world street whose tall houses footfalls echoed seemed accompanied invisible multitude reached part unaccountably changes name becomes john street

moment affair happened gone forty yards john street place crossed henry street raced across road corner latter street 
reached however little thoroughfare empty paused moment sound retreating footsteps broke silence 
shot certainly came said thorndyke come broke run 
yards street mews turns left companion plunged motioning go straight accordingly paces reached top street 
narrow thoroughfare broad smooth pavement bears left parallel mews arrived corner glanced little street saw man bicycle gliding swiftly silently towards little james street 
mighty shout stop thief started hot pursuit though man feet moving apparently leisurely manner drew ahead astonishing pace spite efforts overtake dawned upon slow revolutions feet due reality unusually high gear machine riding

yes answered riding machine geared ninety 
ah must followed us station said thorndyke 
notice carrying anything walking stick hand 
see anything else 
sort walking stick see distinctly 
stoutish stick say malacca probably looked like horn handle

turned john street perceived man standing wide doorstep house shattered window looking anxiously street 
either gents know anything asked pointing broken pane 
yes said thorndyke happened passing done fact added rather suspect missile whatever intended benefit 
oh said man

whoever made bicycle unable catch 
oh said man regarding us growing suspicion 
bicycle hay dam funny like find said thorndyke 
see house empty 
yes empty leastways let 
caretaker 
got merely answered thorndyke object stone bullet whatever may aimed believe like ascertain nature

paraffin lamp floor recess hall conductor took elosed street door 
room said turning key thrusting door open library call front parlor plain english 
entered holding lamp head stared balefully broken window 
thorndyke glanced quickly along floor direction missile would taken said see mark wall spoke indicated wall opposite window obviously could struck projectile entering extreme obliquity point fact fortunately remembered great virtue silence 
friend approached wall still holding lamp scrutinised surface close attention thus engaged observed thorndyke stoop quickly pick something deposited carefully without remark waistcoat pocket 
see bruise anywhere said caretaker sweeping hand wall 
perhaps thing struck wall suggested thorndyke pointing one actually line fire 
yes course added would one shot came henry street 
caretaker crossed room threw light lamp wall thus indicated 
ah exclaimed gloomy satisfaction pointing small dent wall paper turned back plaster exposed looks almost like bullet mark say hear report 
said thorndyke report must catapult 
caretaker set lamp floor proceeded grope projectile operation assisted could suppress faint smile noted earnestness thorndyke peered floor search missile quietly reposing waistcoat pocket 
deep investigations heard uncompromising double knock street door followed loud pealing bell basement 
bobby suppose growled caretaker 
blooming fuss nothing 
caught lamp went leaving us dark 
picked know said thorndyke alone 
saw answered 
good applaud discretion rejoined 
caretaker supposition correct 
returned accompanied burly constable saluted us cheerful smile glanced facetiously round empty room 
boys said nodding towards broken window playful lads 
passing happened sir hear 
yes answered thorndyke gave constable brief account occurrence latter listened notebook hand 
well said narrative concluded hooligan boys going take catapults make things lively round 
ought run em said caretaker 
run em exclaimed constable tone disgust yes magistrate tell em good boys give em five shillings poor box buy illustrated testaments 
testament worthless varmints rammed notebook fiercely pocket stalked room street whither followed 
find bullet stone sweep room said turned beat better let us 
good night sir 
strolled towards henry street thorndyke resumed journey southward 
secret projectile asked friend walked street 
partly avoid discussion caretaker replied principally thought likely constable would pass house seeing light come make inquiries 
hand object 
object specially interesting one highly interesting present moment replied thorndyke chuckle examined 
theory nature theory like test taking police confidence 
going take confidence asked 
get home sleepy replied 
arrival chambers thorndyke desired light clear one end table went workshop fetch tools 
turned back table cover adjusted gas light part table waited impatience colleague return 
minutes entered bearing small vice metal saw wide mouthed bottle 
got bottle asked perceiving metal object inside 
projectile thought fit rinse distilled water reasons presently appear 
agitated bottle gently minute pair dissecting forceps lifted object held surface water drain laid carefully piece blotting paper 
stooped projectile examined great curiosity thorndyke stood regarding almost equal interest 
well said watching silence time see see small brass cylinder answered two inches long rather thicker ordinary lead pencil 
one end conical small hole apex seems contain steel point end flat center small square projection might fit watch key 
notice also small hole side cylinder close flat end 
thing looks like miniature shell appears hollow 
hollow said thorndyke 
must observed held drain water trickled hole pointed end 
yes noticed 
take shake 
felt heavy object rattle inside 
loose body inside said fits pretty closely moves long diameter 
quite description excellent 
nature projectile say miniature shell explosive bullet 
wrong said thorndyke 
natural inference wrong one 
thing demanded curiosity still aroused 
show replied 
something much subtle explosive bullet would really rather crude appliance admirably thought thoroughly well executed 
deal ingenious capable man 
fain laugh enthusiastic appreciation methods would assassin humor situation appeared dawn said apologetic smile expressing approval must understand merely professional admiration 
class criminal creates necessity services 
patron speak ultimate employer 
common crook dealt quite efficiently common policeman speaking fitting little cylinder two pads tissue paper vice screwed tight 
fine metal saw began cut projectile lengthwise two slightly unequal parts 
operation took time especially since careful cut loose body inside length section completed interior cylinder exposed released vice held expression triumph 
make demanded 
took object fingers looked closely first puzzled 
loose body saw cylinder lead half inch long accurately fitting inside cylinder capable slipping freely backwards forwards 
steel point noticed hole apex conical end seen pointed termination slender steel rod projected fully inch cavity cylinder conical end solid mass lead 
well queried thorndyke seeing still silent 
tell explosive bullet replied otherwise confirmed opinion 
said percussion cap carried lead plunger struck end steel rod flight bullet suddenly arrested 
good indeed said thorndyke 
right far fact mechanism percussion shell 
look 
see little rod driven inside bullet latter struck wall 
let us replace original position 
laid end small flat file end rod pressed firmly rod slid hole projected inch beyond apex cone 
handed projectile back 
single glance point steel rod made whole thing clear gave whistle consternation rod fine tube sharply pointed end 
infernal scoundrel exclaimed hypodermic needle 
yes 
veterinary hypodermic extra large bore 
see subtlety ingenuity whole thing 
reasonable chance would certainly succeeded 
speak quite regretfully said laughing oddity attitude towards assassin 
replied 
character single handed player even self reliant man hardly make post mortem 
merely appreciating admirable piece mechanical design efficiently carried 
observe completeness thing way necessities case foreseen met 
projectile discharged powerful air gun walking stick form provided force pump key 
barrel gun rifled 
know asked 
well begin would useless fit needle projectile unless latter made travel point forwards direct evidence barrel rifled 
notice little square projection back surface cylinder 
evidently made fit washer wad probably thin plate soft metal would driven pressure behind grooves rifling thus give spinning motion bullet 
latter left barrel wad would drop leaving free 
see 
wondering square projection 
say extremely ingenious 
highly ingenious said thorndyke enthusiastically whole device 
see perfectly would worked mere fluke complication presence 
supposing alone could approached shorter distance 
case would missed thing would done 
see intended done suppose think answered like hear account process 
well see first finds returning late train seems done waits terminus 
meanwhile fills cylinder solution powerful alkaloidal poison easily done dipping needle liquid sucking small hole near back end piston drawn liquid follow 
notice upper side piston covered vaseline introduced hole doubt would prevent poison coming mouth make cylinder secure leakage 
arrival follows bicycle pass sufficiently secluded neighborhood 
approaches passes waits round corner shoots pretty close range 
matter hits parts equally vital aim middle back

chapter xii might week date trial open 
eight days mystery would almost certainly solved capable solution trial promised quite short one reuben hornby would either convicted felon free man clear stigma crime 
several days past thorndyke almost constant possession laboratory small room devoted ordinarily bacteriology microscopical work kept continually locked state things reduced polton condition extreme nervous irritation especially told indignantly met mr anstey emerging holy holies grinning rubbing hands giving utterance genial unparliamentary expressions amused satisfaction 
met anstey several occasions lately time liked better last whimsical facetious manner covered nature often serious thoughtful found man considerable learning one also lofty standard conduct 
admiration thorndyke unbounded could see two men collaborated utmost sympathy mutual satisfaction 
although regarded mr anstey feelings liveliest friendship far gratified morning writing observed sitting room window crossing gravelled space crown office row evidently bearing chambers 
fact awaiting arrival juliet greatly preferred alone moment seeing thorndyke already gone 
true fair enslaver due nearly half hour could say long anstey would stay embarrassments might arise efforts escape may perceived disease reached advanced stage unequal tactics concealment commonly attributed ostrich 
sharp rap knocker announced arrival disturber peace opened door anstey walked air man hour less consequence whatever 
shook hand mock solemnity seating upon edge table proceeded roll cigarette exasperating deliberation 
infer said learned brother practising parlor magic upstairs peradventure gone journey consultation morning answered 
expecting evidently would 
looked ask question case friend hornby 
know comes trial next week yes thorndyke told 
think hornby prospects going convicted get acquittal entirely passive replied anstey slapped chest impressively going secure acquittal 
highly entertained learned friend mr enemy excessively surprised 
inspected newly made cigarette critical air chuckled softly 
seem pretty confident remarked 
answered though thorndyke considers failure possible course jury box chance filled microcephalic idiots judge prove incapable understanding simple technical evidence 
hope neither things happen feel pretty safe 
way hope divulging principal secrets well replied smile explicit thorndyke ever 
exclaimed mock anxiety must swear secrecy 
thorndyke close quite right 
never cease admiring tactics allowing enemy fortify barricade entrance mean attack 
see wishing devil give cigar go though particular destination 
one thorndyke special brand asked malignantly 
foul trichinopolies brown paper obtained every stationer sooner smoke wig 
tendered case selected cigar anxious care much sniffing bade ceremonious adieu departed stairs blithely humming melody latest comic opera 
left five minutes soft elaborate rat tat little brass knocker brought heart mouth 
ran door flung open revealing juliet standing threshold 
may come asked 
want words start 
looked anxiety manifestly agitated hand held trembled 
greatly upset dr jervis said ignoring chair placed 
mr lawley giving us views poor reuben case attitude fills dismay 
hang mr lawley muttered apologised hastily 
made go miss gibson go came us 
dined us last night walter manner gloomy extreme 
dinner walter took apart asked really thought case 
pessimistic 
dear sir said advice give prepare contemplate disaster philosophically 
opinion cousin almost certain convicted 
said walter defense understood least plausible case 
mr lawley shrugged shoulders 
sort alibi go nothing evidence offer answer prosecution case may say speaking confidence believe case 
see case heard nothing dr thorndyke lead suppose really done anything matter 
true dr jervis oh tell real truth miserable terrified since heard full hope 
tell true reuben sent prison agitation laid hands arm looked face gray eyes swimming tears piteous trustful withal bewitching reserve melted like snow july sun 
true answered taking hands mine speaking perforce low tone might betray emotion 
would mean wilfully deceived false friendship much friendship one ever know 
crept little closer manner penitent wheedling 
going angry foolish listen mr lawley told look like want trust know 
strong wise must make allowance woman neither 
terrible quite unstrung say really displeased would hurt 
oh delilah concluding stroke shears severed last lock left morally speaking bald billiard ball 
henceforth mercy would divulged without scruple uttermost secrets principal astute gentleman placed beyond reach temptation 
angry answered like thorndyke one essay impossible could angry would hurt would 
fact blame egotistical brute 
course alarmed distressed nothing could natural 
let try chase away fears restore confidence 
told thorndyke said reuben good hopes making innocence clear everybody 
alone enough 
know murmured juliet remorsefully please forgive want faith 
continued quote words one whose opinions attach weight 
mr anstey less half hour ago mean reuben counsel yes 
say oh tell said 
said brief quite confident obtaining acquittal prosecution would receive great surprise 
seemed highly pleased brief spoke great admiration thorndyke 
really say confident acquittal voice breathless unsteady clearly said quite unstrung 
relief murmured incoherently kind wiped eyes laughed queer shaky little laugh quite suddenly burst passion sobbing 
hardly conscious drew gently towards rested head shoulder whilst whispered ear know words consolation sure called dear juliet probably used expressions equally improper reprehensible 
presently recovered dried eyes regarded somewhat shamefacedly blushing hotly smiling sweetly nevertheless 
ashamed said coming weeping bosom like great baby 
hoped clients behave way 
whereat laughed heartily emotional equilibrium thus restored began think object meeting 
afraid wasted great deal time said juliet looking watch 
shall late think hope replied reuben looking us must hurry 
caught hat went forth closing oak behind us took way king bench walk silence new delightful sense intimate comradeship 
glanced time time companion noted cheek still bore rosy flush looked sparkle eye smiling softness glance stirred heart trembled intensity passion must needs conceal 
even feeling must tell done tell abject slave goddess queen face love mine man could claim upon even arose still small voice began call unfaithful steward remind duty trust sacred even beyond love 
fleet street hailed cab took seat beside fair companion voice began wax speak bolder sterner accents 
christopher jervis said man honor nought mean pitiful blackguard trusted agent poor misused gentleman planning black heart shall rob man must liberty even honor shame miserable weakling done philanderings keep covenants like gentleman least honest man point meditations juliet turned towards coaxing smile 
legal adviser seems revolving deep weighty matter said 
pulled together looked sparkling eyes rosy dimpling cheeks winsome lovely lovable 
come thought must put end lost 
cost agony effort agony trust may duly set account may sit judgement 
legal adviser miss gibson said miss gibson thought looked little queerly reflecting acted considerably beyond jurisdiction 
respect asked 
passing information given strict confidence fact implied promise secrecy part 
information secret character appeared 
see thorndyke thinks important let prosecution suspect anything sleeve kept even mr lawley dark never said much anstey morning 
sorry told think led breach trust 
spoke without trace petulance tone dignified self accusation made feel veritable worm 
dear miss gibson expostulated entirely misunderstand 
least sorry told 
could done otherwise circumstances want understand taken responsibility communicating really professional secret consider 
understood replied juliet may rely upon utter syllable subject anyone 
thanked promise way making conversation gave account detail anstey visit even omitting incident cigar 
dr thorndyke cigars extraordinarily bad asked 
replied every man taste 
trichinopoly cheroot thorndyke one dissipation must say takes temperately 
ordinary circumstances smokes pipe specially heavy day work occasion festivity rejoicing indulges trichinopoly smokes best got 
even greatest men weaknesses juliet moralised wish known dr thorndyke sooner mr hornby large box trichinopoly cheroots given believe exceptionally fine ones 
however tried one like transferred whole consignment walter smokes sorts conditions cigars 
talked one commonplace another conventional last 
nervousness overdid part broken ice proceeded smash impalpable fragments 
endeavouring merely unemotional avoid undue intimacy manner swung opposite extreme became almost stiff perhaps since writhing agony repression 
meanwhile corresponding change took place companion 
first manner seemed doubtful bewildered grew distant polite less disposed conversation 
perhaps conscience began rebuke may coolness suggested conduct quite kind would commended reuben 
however may continued draw farther farther apart short half hour retraced steps growing friendship purpose descended cab prison gate seemed like strangers first day met 
miserable ending delightful comradeship yet end could one expect world cross purposes things might extremity wretchedness could wept bosom portly warder opened wicket even juliet wept upon mine almost relief brief visit find return together king cross wont juliet would go back omnibus might shopping oxford street leaving walk home alone 
saw omnibus stood pavement looking wistfully lumbering vehicle dwindled distance 
last sigh deepest despondency turned face homeward walking like one dream retraced route journeyed often late different sensations 
chapter xiii murder post next days perhaps unhappy known 
life indeed since left hospital one many disappointments much privation 
unfulfilled desires ambitions unrealised combined distaste daily drudgery fallen lot embitter poverty cause look gloomy distrust upon unpromising future 
sorrow hitherto experienced could compare grief felt contemplating irretrievable ruin knew great passion life 
man like friends deep affections one great emotional upheaval exhausts possibilities nature leaving capacity feeble ineffective echoes 
edifice love raised upon ruins great passion compare original paltry mosque perches upon mound jonah glories palace lies entombed beneath 
made pretext write juliet received reply quite frank friendly tone knew women would done set blame upon temporary outburst emotion 
yet subtle difference previous manner writing emphasised finality separation 
think thorndyke perceived something gone awry though great pains maintain cheerful exterior keep occupied probably formed pretty shrewd guess nature trouble said nothing judged observed change manner fact blended usual quiet geniality almost insensible note sympathy affection 
couple days last interview juliet event occurred served certainly relieve tension distract thoughts though agreeable manner 
pleasant reposeful hour dinner custom sit respective easy chairs smoked pipes discuss many topics common interest 
postman discharged capacious letter box avalanche letters circulars sat glancing solitary letter fallen share looked time time thorndyke noticed often done surprise curious habit turning closely scrutinising every letter package opened 
observe thorndyke ventured remark always examine outside letter looking inside 
seen people always appeared singularly foolish proceeding 
speculate unopened letter glance contents tell know perfectly right answered object inspection discover sender letter 
object 
case habit one deliberately cultivated reference letters everything comes hands habit allowing nothing pass without certain amount conscious attention 
observant man reality attentive man called power observation simply capacity continuous attention 
matter fact found practice habit useful one even reference letters gleaned hint outside letter proved valuable applied contents 
instance letter opened fastened apparently aid steam 
envelope soiled rubbed smells faintly stale tobacco evidently carried pocket along well used pipe 
opened reading perceive reached two days ago date skilfully altered thirteenth fifteenth 
inference correspondent highly untrustworthy clerk 
correspondent may carried letter pocket objected 
hardly replied thorndyke 
would troubled steam letter open close would cut envelope addressed fresh one 
clerk could letter confidential addressed principal handwriting 
principal would almost certainly added postscript moreover smoke 
however obvious something rather subtle put aside detailed examination 
make handed small parcel attached string typewritten address label back bore printed inscription james bartlett sons cigar manufacturers london havana 
afraid said turning little packet examining every part minutely rather subtle 
thing observe typewriter bungled address considerably 
otherwise seems ordinary packet indeed 
well observed one point interest rate said thorndyke taking packet 
let us examine thing systematically note see 
first place notice label ordinary luggage label may buy stationer string attached 
manufacturers commonly use different substantial pattern attached string parcel 
small matter 
much striking address label 
typewritten say typed badly 
know anything typewriters little 
recognize machine well label typed blickensderfer excellent machine form commonly selected rough work manufacturer office let pass 
important point blickensderfer company make several forms machine smallest lightest literary specially designed use journalists men letters 
label typed literary machine least literary typewheel really remarkable circumstance indeed 
know asked 
asterisk written mistake inexpert operator pressed figure lever instead one capitals 
literary typewheel one asterisk noticed thinking purchasing machine 
striking fact even manufacturer chose use blick factory inconceivable select literary form preference suitable commercial machine 
yes agreed certainly singular 
pursued thorndyke consider writing 
done absolute beginner 
failed space two places written five wrong letters written figures instead capitals two instances 
yes made shocking muddle 
wonder throw label away type another 
precisely said thorndyke 
wish find look back label 
see name firm instead printed label usual manner printed separate slip paper pasted label foolish clumsy arrangement involving immense waste time 
look closely printed slip perceive something still remarkable slip cut fit label cut pair scissors 
edges quite straight one place overlap characteristic cut made scissors seen quite plainly 
handed packet reading lens could distinctly make points mentioned 
need point continued slips would ordinarily trimmed printer correct size machine would leave absolutely true edge need say sane business man would adopt device 
slip paper cut scissors fit label pasted surface made fit waste time trouble practice means money could saved printing name label 
yes still see fellow thrown away label typed another 
look slip said thorndyke 
faintly evenly discolored appearance soaked water 
let us moment assume 
would look removed package would suggest person using one slip soaked original package dried cut pasted present label 
pasted typing address would probably done might well unwilling risk destroying soaking second time 
think suspicion package may tampered need jump conclusions replied thorndyke 
merely gave case instance showing careful examination outside package letter may lead us bestow little extra attention contents 
let us open see contents 
sharp knife divided outside cover revealing stout cardboard box wrapped number advertisement sheets 
box lid raised seen contain single cigar large cheroot packed cotton wool 
trichy jove exclaimed 
special fancy thorndyke 
yes another anomaly see might escaped notice qui vive 
matter fact see said think awful blockhead perceive anything singular cigar manufacturer sending sample cigar 
read label think replied thorndyke 
however let us look one leaflets see say 
ah messrs bartlett sons extensive plantations island cuba manufacture cigars exclusively selected leaves grown 
would hardly make trichinopoly cheroot leaf grown west indies striking anomaly east indian cigar sent us west indian grower 
infer principally cigar way uncommonly fine specimen would smoke ten thousand pounds deserving attentive examination 
produced pocket powerful doublet lens aid examined every part surface cigar finally ends 
look small end said handing cigar lens tell notice anything 
focussed lens flush cut surface closely rolled leaf explored every part minutely 
seems said leaf opened slightly center fine wire passed 
appeared replied thorndyke agreement far carry investigations step 
laid cigar table keen thin bladed penknife neatly divided lengthwise two halves 
ecce signum exclaimed thorndyke two parts fell asunder moments stood silently regarding dismembered cheroot 
half inch small end appeared little circular patch white chalky material even manner diffused among leaf evidently deposited solution 
ingenious friend surmise said thorndyke length taking one halves examining white patch lens 
thoughtful soul jervis original 
wish talents could applied direction 
shall remonstrate becomes troublesome 
duty society thorndyke exclaimed passionately infernal cold blooded scoundrel arrested instantly 
man standing menace community 
really know sent thing form pretty shrewd guess however quite thing 
see quite clever time left one two traces identity might ascertained 
indeed traces left ah nice little problem us consider 
settled easy chair proceeded fill pipe air man discuss matter merely general interest 
let us consider information ingenious person given us 
first place evidently strong interest immediate decease 
feel urgent desire death question property hardly far rich man provisions known alone 
question private enmity revenge think 
best belief private enemies whatever 
remains vocation investigator fields legal criminal research 
interest death must therefore connected professional activities 
present conducting exhumation may lead charge murder die night inquiry would carried equal efficiency professor spicer toxicologist 
death would affect prospects accused 
one two cases hand could equally well conducted someone else 
inference friend connected cases believes possess exclusive information concerning believes one person world suspects convict 
let us assume existence person person whose guilt alone evidence 
person unaware communicated knowledge third party would reasonably suppose making away put position security 
first point 
sender offering probably person concerning hold certain exclusive information 
see interesting corollary follows 
alone suspect person therefore published suspicions others would suspect 
suspect suspecting since spoken evidently must possession exclusive information 
words suspicions correct could aware existence 
next point selection rather unusual type cigar 
sent trichinopoly instead ordinary havana bartletts actually manufacture looks aware peculiar predilection thus consulting personal tastes guarded chance giving cigar person 
may therefore infer friend probably knowledge habits 
third point social standing gentle stranger call x bartletts send advertisements samples thomas richard henry 
send chiefly members professions men means position 
true original package might annexed clerk office boy domestic servant probabilities x received package borne fact able obtain access powerful alkaloidal poison undoubtedly 
case would probably medical man chemist suggested 
necessarily replied thorndyke 
laws relating poisons badly framed administered well person necessary knowledge obtain almost poison wants 
social position important factor whence may conclude x belongs least middle class 
fourth point relates personal qualities x evident instance alone man exceptional intelligence considerable general information ingenious resourceful 
cigar device clever original adapted special circumstances remarkable forethought 
thus cheroot selected apparently two excellent reasons first likely form smoked person intended second require end cut might led discovery poison 
plan also shows certain knowledge chemistry poison intended merely dissolved moisture mouth 
idea evidently steam generated combustion leaf distal end would condense cooler part cigar dissolve poison solution would drawn mouth 
nature poison certain similarities procedure seem identify x cyclist used ingenious bullet 
poison case white non crystalline solid poison contained bullet solution white non crystalline solid analysis showed poisonous akaloids 
bullet virtually hypodermic syringe poison cigar introduced form alcoholic ethereal solution hypodermic syringe 
shall thus justified assuming bullet cigar came person may say x person considerable knowledge great ingenuity mean skill mechanician shown manufacture bullet 
principal facts may add surmise recently purchased second hand blickensderfer literary form least fitted literary typewheel 
quite see arrive said surprise 
merely guess know replied though probable one 
first place obviously unused typing numerous mistakes show therefore machine long 
type peculiar blickensderfer one mistakes asterisk printed place letter

age machine evident signs wear letters lost sharpness evident case letters used e notice instance much worn e occurs frequently letter alphabet

case means identifying machine ever meet 
picked label handed together pocket lens 
look closely e discussing occurs five times thorndyke bench inner temple 
case notice minute break loop summit 
break corresponds tiny dent type caused probably striking small hard object 
make quite distinctly said valuable point identification 
almost conclusive thorndyke replied especially joined facts would elicited search premises 
let us recapitulate facts friend x placed disposal 
first x person concerning possess certain exclusive information 
second knowledge personal habits 
third man means social position 
fourth man considerable knowledge ingenuity mechanical skill 
fifth probably purchased quite recently second hand blick fitted literary typewheel 
sixth machine whether person property identified characteristic mark small e note six points add x probably expert cyclist fairly good shot rifle may possibly able presently complete equation x afraid said possess necessary data suspect repeat duty society say nothing clients whose interests would suffer death fellow laid heels mischief 
yes shall interfere becomes really troublesome reasons wishing leave alone present 
really know well think solve equation offered solution 
see certain data suggest possess 
instance certain ingenious gentleman concerning hold believe exclusive information knowledge make appear unlikely might author neat little plans 
much impressed said put away notebook jotted points thorndyke advised consider much impressed powers observation capacity reasoning apparently trivial data see even viewed cigar immediate decided suspicion 
nothing actually suggest existence poison yet seemed form suspicion search though expected find 
yes replied thorndyke certain extent right 
idea poisoned cigar new thereby hangs tale 
laughed softly gazed fire eyes twinkled quiet amusement 
heard say resumed short pause first took chambers practically nothing 
invented new variety medico legal practice build slow degrees natural consequence long time yielded nothing almost unlimited leisure 
leisure means wasted employed considering class cases likely employed working theoretical examples seeing crimes person nearly always strong medical interest gave special attention 
instance planned series murders selecting royal personages great ministers victims murder brought bear special knowledge skill ingenuity command 
inquired minutely habits hypothetical victims ascertained associates friends enemies servants considered diet residences modes conveyance source clothing fact everything necessary know order achieve deaths certainty absolute safety murderer 
deeply gratified flattered great personages would felt remarked known much attention receiving 
yes suppose would somewhat startling prime minister instance learned watched studied attentive observer arrangements decease completed minutest detail

well particulars crimes wrote length private shorthand journal kept purpose need say locked securely safe using 
completing case custom change sides play game opposite side board say added appendix case analysis complete scheme detection crime 
safe present moment six volumes cases fully indexed assure highly instructive reading really valuable works reference 
readily believe replied laughing heartily nevertheless grotesqueness whole proceeding though might proved rather incriminating documents passed possession 
would never read rejoined thorndyke 
shorthand think quite undecipherable made intentionally view secrecy 
theoretical cases ever turned real life several though imperfectly planned carried rule 
poisoned cigar one though course never adopted conspicuous device presenting incident night modification worse another 
fact intricate artistic crimes deal professionally complete elaborate prototypes journals 
silent time reflecting strange personality gifted friend singular fitness presented part chosen play drama social life presently thoughts returned peril overshadowed came back original question 
thorndyke said penetrated motives disguise villain going put safely lock key left peace security plan perhaps successful scheme destruction present replied thorndyke going put things place safety 
morrow shall come hospital see place ends cigar custody dr chandler make analysis report nature poison 
shall act whatever way seems best 
unsatisfactory conclusion appeared knew useless raise objections accordingly cigar accompanying papers wrappings deposited drawer dismissed thoughts least conversation

written mrs hornby one witnesses say meet mr lawley office escort miss gibson court 
walter hornby may better leave possible come lawley 
come office 
shall go straight court anstey 
besides expecting superintendent miller scotland yard probably walk us 
glad hear said rather uneasy thought mixing crowd without kind protection 
well see taking precautions assaults ingenious x tell truth also commit flagrant bull never forgive allowed kill completed reuben hornby defense 
ah polton man wires morning wandering rooms ever since came like cat new house 
quite true sir said polton smiling unabashed use denying 
come ask going take us court 
find box portfolio table room replied thorndyke 
better also take microscope micrometers though likely want think

yes sir take

mr miller scotland yard sir shall show yes 
rose chair tall military looking man entered room saluted casting time inquiring glance direction

perceiving matter hand confidential nature thought best take departure accordingly soon ascertained wanted yet half hour time mrs hornby juliet due lawyer office 
mr lawley received stiffness bordered hostility 
evidently deeply offended subordinate part compelled play case great pains conceal fact 
informed said frosty tone explained mission mrs hornby miss gibson meet 
arrangement none making none arrangements case making 
treated throughout lack ceremony confidence positively scandalous 
even solicitor defense completely dark defense contemplated though fully expect involved ridiculous fiasco 
trust may never associated hybrid practitioners 
ne sutor ultra crepidam sir excellent motto let medical cobbler stick medical last 
remains seen kind boot turn legal last retorted 
rejoined hear mrs hornby voice outer office neither time waste idle talk suggest make way court without delay 
wish good morning acting plain hint retired clerks office found mrs hornby juliet former undisguisedly tearful terrified latter calm though pale agitated 
better start said exchanged greetings 
shall take cab walk think walk mind said juliet 
mrs hornby wants words go court 
see one witnesses terrified lest say something damaging reuben 
subpoena served asked 
mr lawley sent replied mrs hornby went see next day tell anything seem know wanted nice 
expect evidence relate thumbograph said 
really nothing else connection case knowledge 
walter said exclaimed mrs hornby 
went rooms talk matter 
upset whole affair afraid thinks badly poor reuben prospects 
trust may wrong oh dear dreadful thing sure poor lady halted mop eyes elaborately surprise manifest scorn passing errand boy 
thoughtful sympathetic walter mean know pursued mrs hornby helpful 
asked knew horrid little book took answers writing 
wrote questions likely asked answers could read get well head 
good made print machine could read without glasses beautifully 
paper pocket 
know mr walter went printing said 
regular printing press printing press exactly replied mrs hornby small thing lot round keys press dickensblerfer think called ridiculous name walter bought one literary friends week ago getting quite clever already though make mistakes still see 
halted began search opening pocket hidden away occult recess clothing unconscious effect explanation produced 
instantly spoke flashed mind one points thorndyke given identification mysterious x probably purchased quite recently second hand blickensderfer fitted literary typewheel 
coincidence striking even startling though moment reflection convinced nothing coincidence must hundreds second hand blicks market walter hornby certainly could quarrel thorndyke would rather interested preservation reuben account 
thoughts passed mind rapidly time mrs hornby run pocket earth quite recovered momentary shock

put safety knowing liable one get one pocket picked crowded london streets 
opened bulky receptacle drew manner concertina exhibiting multitudinous partitions stuffed pieces paper coils tape sewing silk buttons samples dress materials miscellaneous rubbish mingled indiscriminately gold silver copper coins 
run eye dr jervis said handing folded paper give advice answers 
opened paper read committee society protection paralysed idiots submitting oh given wrong paper 
silly appeal remember juliet dear troublesome person really quite rude know dr jervis tell charity begins home although thank heaven none us paralysed must consider think one dear interposed juliet whose pale cheek ghost dimple appeared 
looks cleaner others 
selected folded paper purse mrs hornby holding hands extended utmost though produce burst music opening glanced contents 
yes evidence said passed paper

first glance felt head swim heart throb violently 
paper headed evidence respecting thumbograph every one five small e occurred sentence could see plainly strong door light small break interval summit loop 
thunderstruck 
one coincidence quite possible even probable two together second one remarkable character beyond reasonable limits probability 
identification seem admit doubt yet legal adviser appears somewhat preoccupied remarked juliet something old gaiety manner fact though held paper hand gaze fixed unmeaningly adjacent lamp post 
spoke pulled together scanning paper hastily fortunate enough find first paragraph matter requiring comment 
observe mrs hornby said answer first question whence obtain thumbograph say remember clearly think must bought railway bookstall 
understood brought home given walter 
thought replied mrs hornby walter tells course would remember better 
dear aunt sure gave interposed juliet 
remember night colleys came dinner hard pressed find amusement walter came produced thumbograph 
yes remember quite well said mrs hornby 
fortunate reminded 
must alter answer 
mrs hornby said would disregard paper altogether 
confuse get difficulties 
answer questions put well remember say 
yes much wisest plan said juliet 
let dr jervis take charge paper rely memory 
well dear replied mrs hornby think best keep paper dr jervis throw away 
slipped document pocket without remark proceeded way mrs hornby babbling inconsequently occasional outbursts emotion juliet silent abstracted 
struggled concentrate attention elder lady conversation thoughts continually reverted paper pocket startling solution seemed offer mystery poisoned cigar 
could walter hornby reality miscreant x thing seemed incredible hitherto shadow suspicion appeared fall 
yet denying description tallied remarkable manner hypothetical x man means social position man considerable knowledge mechanical skill though ingenuity could judge 
recently bought second hand blickensderfer probably literary typewheel since purchased literary man machine showed characteristic mark small e two remaining points indeed clear 
obviously could form opinion whether thorndyke held exclusive information concerning reference knowledge friend habits first inclined doubtful suddenly recalled pang remorse self accusation various details communicated juliet might easily innocence handed walter 
instance told thorndyke preference trichinopoly cheroot might naturally spoken walter possessed supply 
regard time arrival king cross informed letter way confidential reason information passed walter one party family dinner 
coincidence seemed complete enough truth yet incredible reuben cousin could blackhearted villain could motive dastardly crimes 
suddenly new idea struck 
mrs hornby obtained access typewriting machine mrs hornby could john hornby description would part fit elder man well younger though evidence possessing special mechanical skill suspicions already fastened upon remembered thorndyke means rejected theory connected crime 
point reflections broken upon mrs hornby grasped arm uttered deep groan 
reached corner old bailey us frowning walls newgate 
within walls knew though mention fact reuben hornby confined prisoners awaiting trial glance massive masonry stained dingy gray grime city put end speculations brought back drama nearly approaching climax 
old thoroughfare crowded many memories hideous tragedy side gloomy prison past debtors door forbidding spiked wicket past gallows gate festoons fetters walked silence reached entrance sessions house 
little relieved find thorndyke look us mrs hornby spite really heroic efforts control emotion state impending hysteria juliet though outwardly calm composed showed waxen pallor cheeks certain wildness eyes terror reviving glad spared unpleasantness contact policemen guarded various entrances

polton degrees rising erect posture smote thigh resounding thwack chuckled aloud proceeding caused eyes including judge turned 
noise repeated said judge stony stare horrified offender shrunk smallest space ever seen human occupy shall cause person made removed court 
understand pursued anstey consider thumb print sworn prisoner forgery yes 
forgery 
possible forge thumb print finger print possible quite easy 
easy forge signature instance much infinitely secure 
signature written pen requires forgery also written pen process demanding special skill never resulting absolute facsimile 
finger print stamped impression finger tip stamp necessary obtain stamp identical character finger tip order produce impression absolute facsimile every respect original totally indistinguishable 
would means detecting difference forged finger print genuine original none whatever reason would difference detect 
stated quite positively thumb print paper forgery 
forged print indistinguishable original able certain particular print forgery speaking possible due care obviously forger might inadvertence fail produce absolute facsimile detection would possible 
happened present case 
forged print absolute facsimile true print 
slight discrepancy 
addition paper bears intrinsic evidence thumb print forgery 
consider evidence presently dr thorndyke 
return possibility forging finger print explain us without technical methods would possible produce stamp referred two principal methods suggest 
first rather crude though easy carry consists taking actual cast end finger 
mould would made pressing finger plastic material fine modelling clay hot sealing wax pouring warm solution gelatine mould allowing cool solidify cast would produced would yield perfect finger prints 
method would rule useless purpose forger could ordinarily carried without knowledge victim though case dead bodies persons asleep unconscious anesthetic could practiced success would offer advantage requiring practically technical skill knowledge special appliances 
second method much efficient one doubt used present instance requires knowledge skill 
first place necessary obtain possession access genuine finger print 
finger print photograph taken rather photographic negative purpose requires taken reversed plate negative put special printing frame plate gelatine treated potassium bichromate frame exposed light 
gelatine treated way chromicized gelatine called peculiar property 
ordinary gelatine well known easily dissolved hot water chromicized gelatine also soluble hot water long exposed light exposed light undergoes change longer capable dissolved hot water 
plate chromicized gelatine negative protected light opaque parts negative whereas light passes freely transparent parts transparent parts negative correspond black marks finger print correspond ridges finger 
hence follows gelatine plate acted upon light parts corresponding ridges parts gelatine rendered insoluble rest gelatine soluble 
gelatine plate cemented thin plate metal support carefully washed hot water soluble part gelatine dissolved away leaving insoluble part corresponding ridges standing surface 
thus produced facsimile relief finger print actual ridges furrows identical character ridges furrows finger tip 
inked roller passed relief relief pressed lightly inked slab pressed sheet paper finger print produced absolutely identical original even little white spots mark orifices sweat glands 
impossible discover difference real finger print counterfeit fact difference exists 
surely process described difficult intricate one little difficult ordinary carbon printing practiced successfully numbers amateurs 
moreover relief described practically nothing ordinary process block could produced photo engraver 
process described essentials used reproduction pen ink drawings hundreds workmen employed industry could make relief block finger print undetectable forgery could executed 
asserted counterfeit finger print could distinguished original 
prepared furnish proof case yes 
prepared execute counterfeit prisoner thumb print presence court 
say counterfeit would indistinguishable original even experts 
anstey turned towards judge 
would lordship give permission demonstration witness proposes certainly replied judge 
evidence highly material 
propose comparison made added addressing thorndyke 
brought purpose lord answered thorndyke sheets paper ruled twenty numbered squares 
propose make ten squares counterfeits prisoner thumb mark fill remaining ten real thumb marks 
propose experts examine paper tell court real thumb prints false 
seems fair efficient test said lordship 
objection offer sir hector sir hector trumpler hastily consulted two experts sitting attorney bench replied without much enthusiasm objection offer lord 
case shall direct expert witnesses withdraw court prints made 
obedience judge order mr singleton colleague rose left court evident reluctance thorndyke took small portfolio three sheets paper handed judge 
lordship said make marks ten squares two sheets one given jury one retained lordship check third sheet prints made 
excellent plan said judge information jury would better came performed actual stamping table presence foreman jury counsel prosecution defense

thorndyke inked one stamps handed judge examined curiously pressed piece waste paper immediately appeared distinct impression human thumb

mr singleton said judge paper twenty thumb prints 
ten genuine prints prisoner left thumb ten forgeries 
please examine note writing true prints forgeries 
made notes paper handed mr nash 
objection using photograph comparison lord asked mr singleton 
think replied judge 
say mr anstey objection whatever lord answered anstey 
mr singleton accordingly drew pocket enlarged photograph thumb print magnifying glass aid explored bewildering array prints paper proceeded remarked satisfaction expression became dubious worried 
time time made entry memorandum slip beside entries accumulated frown grew deeper aspect puzzled gloomy 
length sat taking memorandum slip hand addressed judge 
finished examination lord 
well 
mr nash kindly examine paper write results examination oh wish would make haste whispered juliet 
think able tell real false thumb prints say replied shall soon know 
looked alike 
mr nash made examination exasperating deliberateness preserved throughout air stolid attention length completed notes handed paper back usher 
mr singleton said judge let us hear conclusions 
sworn 
mr singleton stepped witness box laying notes ledge faced judge 
examined paper handed asked sir hector trumpler 

see paper saw twenty thumb prints evident forgeries evidently genuine doubtful 
taking thumb prints seriatim noted mr singleton examined notes replied thumb print square one evidently forgery also number two though passable imitation 
three four genuine five obvious forgery 
six genuine thumb print seven forgery though good one eight genuine nine think forgery though remarkably good imitation 
ten eleven genuine thumb marks twelve thirteen forgeries fourteen doubtful though inclined regard forgery 
fifteen genuine think sixteen also swear 
seventeen certainly genuine eighteen nineteen rather doubtful disposed consider forgeries 
twenty certainly genuine thumb print 
mr singleton evidence proceeded look surprise began make appearance judge face jury glanced witness notes notes one another undisguised astonishment 
sir hector trumpler luminary british jurisprudence evidently completely fogged statement followed statement pursed lips broad red face became overshadowed expression utter bewilderment 
seconds stared blankly witness dropped seat thump shook court 
doubt said anstey correctness conclusions instance quite sure prints one two forgeries doubt 
swear two prints forgeries mr singleton hesitated moment 
watching judge jury apparently misinterpreted surprise assuming due remarkable powers discrimination confidence revived accordingly 
yes answered swear forgeries 
anstey sat mr singleton passed notes judge retired box giving place colleague 
mr nash listened manifest satisfaction evidence stepped box original confidence restored 
selection true false thumb prints practically identical mr singleton knowledge fact led state conclusions air authoritative even dogmatic 
quite satisfied correctness statements said reply anstey question prepared swear swear thumb prints stated forgeries forgeries detection presents difficulty observer expert acquaintance finger prints 
one question like ask said judge expert left box thorndyke entered continue evidence 
conclusions expert witnesses manifestly bona fide conclusions arrived individual judgement without collusion comparison results practically identical 
virtually complete agreement 
strange thing conclusions wrong every instance nearly laughed aloud glanced two experts expression smug satisfaction countenances changed lightning rapidity ludicrous spasm consternation sometimes wrong sometimes right would case made mere guesses wrong every time 
quite certain quite wrong doubtful incline wrong conclusion 
strange coincidence dr thorndyke 
explain thorndyke face throughout proceedings expressionless wooden figurehead relaxed dry smile 
think lord replied 
object forger executing forgery produce deception shall examine forgery 
ah said judge face relaxed dry smile jury broke unconcealed grins 
evident continued thorndyke experts would unable distinguish real forged thumb prints would look collateral evidence guide 
therefore supplied collateral evidence 
ten prints taken without special precautions single finger probably happen two exactly alike finger rounded object small part touches paper impressions produced show little variations according part finger print made 
stamp used flat surface like printer type like type always prints impression 
reproduce finger tip particular print finger ten prints made single stamp print mechanical repetition nine 
thus sheet bearing twenty finger prints ten forgeries made single stamp would easy pick ten forged prints fact would mechanical repetitions one another genuine prints could distinguished fact presenting trifling variations position finger 
anticipating line reasoning careful make print different stamp stamp made different thumb print selected thumb prints varied widely possible made stamps 
moreover made real thumb prints careful put thumb position time far able happened sheet submitted experts real thumb prints nearly alike forgeries presented considerable variations 
instances witnesses quite certain succeeded making genuine prints repeat one another doubtful cases partially failed 
thank quite clear said judge smile deep content apt appear judicial countenance expert witness knocked pedestal 
may proceed mr anstey 
told us resumed anstey submitted proofs possible forge thumb print detection impossible 
also stated thumb print paper found mr hornby safe forgery 
mean may forgery actually one mean actually forgery 
first come conclusion forgery saw scotland yard 
three facts suggested conclusion 
first place print obviously produced liquid blood yet beautifully clear distinct impression 
impression could produced liquid blood without use slab roller even great care used still less could produced accidental smear 
second place measuring print micrometer found agree dimensions genuine thumb print reuben hornby 
appreciably larger 
photographed print micrometer contact comparing genuine thumb print also photographed micrometer contact found suspected print larger fortieth inch one given point ridge pattern another given point 
enlargements two photographs disagreement size clearly shown lines micrometer 
also micrometer portable microscope court wishes verify photographs 
thank said judge bland smile accept sworn testimony unless learned counsel prosecution demands verification 
received photographs thorndyke handed examined close attention passed jury 
third fact resumed thorndyke much importance since proves print forgery also furnishes distinct clue origin forgery identity forger 
court became hushed silence profound ticking clock seemed sensible interruption 
glanced walter sat motionless rigid end bench perceived horrible pallor spread face forehead covered beads perspiration 
looking print closely noticed one part minute white mark space 
shape capital evidently produced defect paper loose fiber stuck thumb detached paper leaving blank space 
examining paper low power microscope found surface perfect intact 
loose fiber detached broken end least groove lain would visible 
inference seemed loose fiber existed paper found safe paper original thumb mark made 
far knew one undoubted thumb print reuben hornby existence one thumbograph 
request thumbograph brought chambers mrs hornby examining print reuben hornby left thumb perceived minute shaped white space occupying similar position red thumb mark looked powerful lens could clearly see little groove paper fiber lain lifted inked thumb 
subsequently made systematic comparison marks two thumb prints found dimensions mark proportionally say mark thumbograph print extreme length inch extreme breadth 
inch red thumb mark one fortieth larger dimension extreme length 
inch extreme breadth 
inch shape identical shown superimposing tracings greatly enlarged photographs mark similar enlargements mark intersected ridges thumb print manner exactly parts two prints 
say regard facts stated certain red thumb mark forgery also say certain forgery executed means thumbograph 
might resemblances merely coincidence 
law probabilities mr singleton explained clearly evidence adverse chances would run untold millions 
two thumb prints made different places different times interval many weeks intervening 
bears accidental mark due peculiarity thumb peculiarity paper 
theory coincidences necessary suppose piece paper loose fiber exactly identical shape size fiber came accident contact thumb exactly spot 
supposition would opposed probabilities even supposition two exactly similar thumb prints made different persons 
fact paper found safe loose fiber account mark 
explanation presence defibrinated blood safe probably used forger making thumb print purpose fresh blood would less suitable reason clotting 
would probably carried small quantity bottle together pocket slab roller invented mr galton 
would thus possible put drop slab roll thin film take clean impression stamp 
must remembered precautions quite necessary since make recognisable print first attempt 
failure second trial would destroyed accidental appearance might aroused suspicion 
made enlarged photographs thumb prints yes 
two enlarged photographs one thumbograph print one red thumb print 
show white mark clearly assist comparison originals mark plainly visible lens 
handed two photographs judge together thumbograph memorandum slip powerful doublet lens examine 
judge inspected two original documents aid lens compared photographs nodding approvingly made points agreement 
passed jury made entry notes 
going attention attracted walter hornby 
expression terror wild despair settled face ghastly pallor bedewed sweat 
looked furtively thorndyke noted murderous hate eyes recalled midnight adventure john street mysterious cigar 
suddenly rose feet wiping brow steadying bench shaking hand walked quietly door went 
apparently onlooker interested doings door swung superintendent miller rose seat went door 
cross examining witness judge inquired glancing sir hector trumpler 
lord reply 
calling witnesses mr anstey one lord replied anstey prisoner shall put witness box matter form order may make statement oath 
reuben accordingly conducted dock witness box sworn made solemn declaration innocence 
brief cross examination followed nothing elicited reuben spent evening club gone home rooms half past eleven let latchkey 
sir hector length sat prisoner led back dock court settled listen speeches counsel 
lord gentlemen jury anstey commenced clear mellow tones propose occupy time long speech 
evidence laid intelligible lucid conclusive doubt arrive verdict uninfluenced display rhetoric either part part learned counsel prosecution 
nevertheless desirable disentangle mass evidence facts really vital crucial 
one fact stands dominates whole case prisoner connection case rests solely upon police theory infallibility finger prints 
apart evidence thumb print never faintest breath suspicion 
heard described man unsullied honor man whose character reproach man trusted implicitly dealings 
character given casual stranger one known childhood 
record unbroken record honorable conduct life clean living straightforward gentleman 
stands charged miserable paltry theft charged robbed generous friend brother father guardian childhood benefactor planned striven well charged short gentlemen crime every circumstance connected every trait known character renders utterly inconceivable 
upon grounds gentleman irreproachable character charged mean sordid crime baldly stated grounds accusation certain learned eminent man science made statement police merely accepted practice extended beyond original meaning 
statement follows complete nearly complete accordance two prints single finger affords evidence requiring corroboration persons made 
statement gentlemen highest degree misleading ought made without due warning qualification 
far true practice exact contrary fact evidence finger print absence corroboration absolutely worthless 
forms forgery forgery finger print easiest secure seen court day 
consider character high class forger skill ingenuity resource 
think forged banknotes engraving design signature even paper private watermarks imitated perfection admiration despair distinguish true false think forged cheque actual perforations filled portions cut bodily replaced indistinguishable patches think finger print photo engraver apprentice make forgery greatest experts distinguish original capable amateur imitate beyond detection month practice ask kind evidence without support corroboration gentleman honor position dragged criminal court charged committed crime basest sordid type 
must detain unnecessary appeals 
remind briefly salient facts 
case prosecution rests upon assertion thumb print found safe made thumb prisoner 
thumb print made prisoner case suspicion kind 
thumb print made prisoner thumb conclusive evidence 
thumb print differed size scale pattern genuine thumb print prisoner difference small fatal police theory two prints identical 
prisoner thumb print resemblance pattern exact thumb print another person reproduced pattern ridges prisoner thumb also scar old wound 
answer propose question intentional imitation prisoner thumb print made purpose fixing suspicion prisoner ensuring safety actual criminal 
facts support theory yes several facts support strongly 
first facts mentioned 
red thumb print disagreed genuine print scale dimensions 
prisoner thumb print neither person 
alternative forgery 
second place print evidently made aid certain appliances materials one materials namely defibrinated blood found safe 
third place coincidence print one possible forge 
prisoner ten digits eight fingers two thumbs 
existence actual prints two thumbs whereas prints fingers existence hence would impossible forge print fingers 
happens red thumb print resembled one two prints forgery possible 
fourth place red thumb print reproduces accidental peculiarity thumbograph print 
red thumb print forgery must made thumbograph print since exists print could made 
hence striking fact red thumb print exact replica including accidental peculiarities print forgery could made 
accidental shaped mark thumbograph print accounted condition paper occurrence mark red thumb print accounted peculiarity paper accounted way excepting assuming one copy 
conclusion thus inevitable red thumb print photo mechanical reproduction thumbograph print 
yet another point 
red thumb print forgery reproduced thumbograph print forger must time access thumbograph 
heard mrs hornby remarkable story mysterious disappearance thumbograph still mysterious reappearance 
story left doubt minds person surreptitiously removed thumbograph unknown interval secretly replaced 
thus theory forgery receives confirmation every point agreement every known fact whereas theory red thumb print genuine thumb print based upon gratuitous assumption single fact advanced support 
accordingly gentlemen assert prisoner innocence proved complete convincing manner ask verdict accordance proof 
anstey resumed seat low rumble applause heard gallery 
subsided instantly gesture disapproval judge silence fell upon court clock cynical indifference continued record brusque monotone passage fleeting seconds 
saved dr jervis oh surely saved juliet exclaimed agitated whisper 
must see innocent 
patience little longer answered 
soon 
sir hector trumpler already feet bestowing jury stern hypnotic stare plunged reply really admirable air conviction sincerity 
lord gentlemen jury case court one already remarked human nature presented highly unfavourable light 
need insist upon aspect case already doubt impressed sufficiently 
necessary merely learned friend aptly expressed disentangle actual facts case web casuistry woven around 
facts extreme simplicity 
safe opened property great value abstracted 
opened means false keys 
two men time time possession true keys thus opportunity making copies 
safe opened rightful owner property gone found print thumb one two men 
thumb print safe closed 
man whose thumb print found left handed man print print left thumb 
would seem gentlemen conclusion obvious sane person could found contest submit conclusion sane person would arrive possible conclusion person whose thumb print found safe person stole property safe 
thumb print admittedly prisoner bar therefore prisoner bar person stole diamonds safe 
true certain fantastic attempts made explain away obvious facts 
certain far fetched scientific theories propounded exhibition legerdemain taken place venture think would appropriate place public entertainment court justice 
exhibition doubt afforded considerable amusement 
furnished pleasing relaxation serious business court 
even instructive showing extent possible plain facts perverted misdirected ingenuity 
unless prepared consider crime elaborate hoax practical joke carried facetious criminal extraordinary knowledge skill general attainments must come conclusion facts justify safe opened property abstracted prisoner 
accordingly gentlemen ask regard important position guardians well security fellow citizens give verdict accordance evidence solemnly sworn verdict submit prisoner guilty crime charged 
sir hector sat jury listened speech solid attention gazed expectantly judge though say two believe judge turned notes air quiet composure writing word compared various points evidence 
turned jury manner persuasive confidential necessary gentlemen commenced occupy time exhaustive analysis evidence 
evidence heard given part admirable clearness 
moreover learned counsel defense collated compared evidence lucidly may say impartially detailed repetition part would superfluous 
shall therefore confine comments may help consideration verdict 
need hardly point reference made learned counsel prosecution far fetched scientific theories somewhat misleading 
evidence theoretical character finger print experts 
evidence dr rowe dr thorndyke dealt exclusively matters fact 
inferences drawn accompanied statements facts yielded inferences 
examination evidence heard shows learned counsel defense justly observed entire case resolves single question thumb print found mr hornby safe made thumb prisoner thumb print made prisoner thumb prisoner must least present safe unlawfully opened 
thumb print made prisoner thumb nothing connect crime 
question one fact upon duty decide must remind gentlemen sole judges facts case consider remarks mine merely suggestions entertain disregard according judgement 
let us consider question light evidence 
thumb print either made prisoner 
evidence brought forward show made prisoner well evidence ridge pattern 
pattern identical pattern prisoner thumb print even impression scar crosses pattern particular manner prisoner thumb print 
need enter elaborate calculations chances agreement practical fact disputed red thumb print genuine thumb print made prisoner thumb 
contended genuine thumb print mechanical imitation fact forgery 
general question thus becomes narrowed particular question genuine thumb print forgery let us consider evidence 
first evidence genuine thumb print none 
identity pattern evidence point forgery would also exhibit identity pattern 
genuineness thumb print assumed prosecution evidence offered 
evidence red thumb print forgery first question size 
two different sized prints could hardly made thumb 
evidence use appliances 
safe robbers ordinarily provide inking slabs rollers make distinct impressions fingers 
accidental mark print also exists genuine print could used purpose forgery easily explained theory forgery otherwise totally incomprehensible 
finally strange disappearance thumbograph strange reappearance 
striking weighty evidence must added adduced dr thorndyke showing perfectly possible imitate finger print 
main facts case consider 
careful consideration decide red thumb print actually made prisoner thumb duty pronounce prisoner guilty weighing evidence decide thumb print forgery duty pronounce prisoner guilty 
past usual luncheon hour desire retire consider verdict court adjourns 
jurymen whispered together moments foreman stood 
agreed verdict lord said 
prisoner led back dock brought back bar 
gray wigged clerk court stood addressed jury 
agreed upon verdict gentlemen replied foreman 
say gentlemen prisoner guilty guilty guilty replied foreman raising voice glancing reuben 
storm applause burst gallery moment disregarded judge 
mrs hornby laughed aloud strange unnatural laugh crammed handkerchief mouth sat gazing reuben tears coursing face juliet laid head upon desk sobbed silently 
brief space judge raised admonitory hand commotion subsided addressed prisoner stood bar calm self possessed though face bore slight flush reuben hornby jury duly weighing evidence case found guilty crime charged 
verdict heartily agree 
view evidence given consider verdict possible venture say leave court innocence fully established without stain upon character 
distress recently suffered well rejoicing verdict jury sympathy court everyone present sympathy diminished consideration less capable defense result might different 
desire express admiration manner defense conducted desire especially observe alone public large deeply indebted dr thorndyke insight knowledge ingenuity probably averted serious miscarriage justice 
court adjourn half past two 
judge rose seat everyone present stood amidst clamor many feet upon gallery stairs door dock thrown open smiling police officer reuben came stairs body court 
chapter xvii last better let people clear said thorndyke first greetings stood around reuben fast emptying court 
want demonstration go 
anything replied reuben 
still held mrs hornby hand one arm passed uncle wiped eyes intervals though face glowed delight 
like come little quiet luncheon chambers us friends together continued thorndyke 
delighted said reuben program would include satisfactory wash come anstey asked thorndyke 
got lunch demanded anstey disrobed right mind say usual whimsical pseudo frivolous character 
question savors gluttony answered thorndyke 
come see

polton gone four wheeler hold us 
hold four us said reuben dr jervis bring juliet jervis request rather took aback considering circumstances conscious nevertheless unreasonable thrill pleasure answered alacrity miss gibson allow shall delighted 
delight apparently shared juliet judge uncomfortable blush spread face 
made objection however merely replied rather coldly well sit roof cab better go 
crowd time presumably cleared took way downstairs 
cab waiting curb surrounded group spectators cheered reuben appeared doorway saw friends enter drive away 
turned walked quickly old bailey towards ludgate hill 
shall take hansom asked 
let us walk replied juliet little fresh air us good musty horrible court 
seems like dream yet relief oh relief 
rather like awakening nightmare find morning sun shining rejoined 
yes like agreed still feel dazed shaken 
turned presently new bridge street towards embankment walking side side without speaking could help comparing bitterness present stiff distant relations intimacy comradeship existed miserable incident last meeting 
look jubilant success expected said length critical glance expect really proud delighted delighted yes proud 
proud played jackal even done badly 
hardly fair statement facts rejoined another quick inquisitive look low spirits day like 
afraid selfish egotistical brute gloomy reply 
ought gay joyful everyone else day whereas fact chafing petty troubles 
see case finished engagement dr thorndyke terminates automatically relapse old life dreary repetition journeying amongst strangers prospect inspiriting 
time bitter trial green oasis desert colourless monotonous life 
enjoyed companionship lovable man admire respect men moved scenes full color interest 
made one friend loth see fade life seems likely 
mean said juliet may say fault fade life 
never forget done us loyalty reuben enthusiasm cause say nothing many kindnesses 
done work badly wrong grievously 
recognized evidence reuben cleared day much done filling details towards making case complete convincing 
shall always feel owe debt deepest gratitude reuben perhaps either us someone else 
asked though great interest 
gratitude family matter little consequence 
well secret replied juliet 
mean girl reuben going marry 
matter dr jervis added tone surprise 
passing gate leads embankment middle temple lane stopped dead archway laying detaining hand upon arm gazing utter amazement 
girl reuben going marry repeated 
always taken granted going marry 
told explicitly exclaimed impatience 
know admitted ruefully thought well imagined things perhaps gone quite smoothly suppose cared man man cloud denied relation pretended merely friends demanded indignantly 
sure replied hastily 
fool idiot jove idiot certainly silly admitted gentleness tone took away bitterness reproach 
reason secrecy continued became engaged night reuben arrested heard charge insisted one told unless fully acquitted 
person confidence sworn secrecy course tell suppose matter would interest 
imbecile murmured 
known well known said difference could made question asked without looking noted cheek grown shade paler 
answered 
spared many day night needless self reproach misery 
asked still keeping face averted 
reproach great deal answered consider supposed position 
think trusted agent man helpless deeply wronged man whose undeserved misfortunes made every demand upon chivalry generosity think called upon protect carry comfort woman regarded virtually man betrothed wife think proceeding straightway known twenty four hours fall hopelessly love admit something reproach 
still silent rather pale thoughtful seemed breathe quickly usual 
course continued may say look keep counsel one would worse 
mischief 
man thinking woman morning noon night whose heart leaps sound coming whose existence blank away blank tries fill recalling said tones voice look eyes spoke help letting see sooner later cares right end duty chivalry even common honesty 
yes understand said juliet softly 
way tripped steps leading fountain court followed cheerfully 
course way knew place silent peaceful plane trees cast pleasant shade gravelled court 
glanced walked slowly towards fountain 
roses mantling cheeks eyes cast lifted instant saw shining moist 
never guess asked 
yes replied low voice guessed added shyly thought guessed wrong 
walked little time without speaking came side fountain stood listening quiet trickle water watching sparrows took bath rim basin 
little way another group sparrows gathered greedy joy around fragments bread scattered abroad benevolent templars hard sentimentally minded pigeon unmindful crumbs marauding sparrows puffed breast strutted curtsied mate endearing gurgles 
juliet rested hand one little posts support chain fountain enclosed laid hand 
presently turned hand mine lay palm standing hand hand elderly gentleman dry legal aspect came steps passed fountain 
looked pigeons looked us went way smiling shaking head 
juliet said looked quickly sparkling eyes frank smile yet little shy 
yes

approving smile said 
think remembering spring time giving us blessing 
perhaps agreed 
looked nice old thing 
gazed fondly retreating figure turned 
cheeks grown pink enough one dimple displayed great advantage rosy setting 
forgive dear unutterable folly asked presently glanced

dreadfully silly 
remember juliet loved whole heart love shall love always 
forgive anything say answered softly 
voice distant temple clock heard uttering polite protest 
infinite reluctance turned away fountain sprinkled us parting benediction slowly retraced steps middle temple lane thence pump court
