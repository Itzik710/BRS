remember fifty years ago god gave us little baby flaxen hair used always sitting river singing songs willows laughing bitterly added baby girl died 
yakov racked memory could remember baby willows 
fancy said 
priest arrived administered sacrament extreme unction 
marfa began muttering something unintelligible towards morning died 
old women neighbors washed dressed laid coffin 
avoid paying sacristan yakov read psalms body got nothing grave grave digger crony 
four peasants carried coffin graveyard money respect 
coffin followed old women beggars couple crazy saints people met crossed piously yakov much pleased creditable decorous cheap offence anyone 
took last leave marfa touched coffin thought good piece work going back cemetery overcome acute depression 
feel quite well breathing labored feverish legs felt weak craving drink 
thoughts sorts forced mind 
remembered life never felt marfa never affectionate 
fifty two years lived hut dragged long long time somehow happened time never thought paid attention though cat dog 
yet every day lighted stove cooked baked gone water chopped wood slept bed came home drunk weddings always reverently hung fiddle wall put bed silence timid anxious expression 
rothschild smiling bowing came meet yakov 
looking uncle said 
moisey ilyitch sends greetings bids come 
yakov felt mood 
wanted cry 
leave alone said walked 
rothschild said fluttered running front 
moisey ilyitch offended bade come yakov revolted jew gasping breath blinking many red freckles face

pestering garlic shouted yakov 
persist jew got angry shouted noisy please send flying fence get sight roared yakov rushed fists 
one live scabby jews rothschild half dead terror crouched waved hands head though ward blow leapt ran away fast legs could carry ran gave little skips kept clasping hands yakov could see long thin spine wriggled 
boys delighted incident ran shouting jew jew dogs joined chase barking 
someone burst roar laughter gave whistle dogs barked even noise unanimity 
dog must bitten rothschild desperate sickly scream heard 
yakov went walk grazing ground wandered random outskirts town street boys shouted bronze bronze came river curlews floated air uttering shrill cries ducks quacked 
sun blazing hot glitter water hurt eyes look 
yakov walked path along bank saw plump rosy cheeked lady come bathing shed thought ugh otter far bathing shed boys catching crayfish bits meat seeing began shouting spitefully bronze bronze saw old spreading willow tree big hollow crow nest suddenly rose vividly yakov memory baby flaxen hair willow tree marfa spoken 
willow tree green still sorrowful old grown poor thing sat began recall past 
bank water meadow days stood big birchwood yonder bare hillside could seen horizon old old pine forest used bluish patch distance 
big boats used sail river 
smooth unruffled bank stood one birch tree youthful slender like young lady nothing river ducks geese look though ever boats 
seemed though even geese fewer old 
yakov shut eyes imagination huge flocks white geese soared meeting one another 
wondered happened last forty fifty years life never river paid attention 
decent sized river trumpery one might gone fishing sold fish merchants officials bar keeper station put money bank might sailed boat one house another playing fiddle people classes would paid hear might tried getting big boats afloat would better making coffins might bred geese killed sent winter moscow feathers alone would likely mount ten roubles year 
wasted time done nothing 
losses ah losses gone things catching fish playing fiddle running boats killing geese fortune would made nothing happened even dreams life passed uselessly without pleasure wasted nothing even pinch snuff nothing left front one looked back nothing losses terrible ones made one cold 
man could live avoid losses misfortunes one wondered cut birch copse pine forest 
walking reason grazing ground people always needful yakov life scolded bellowed shaken fists ill treated wife one might ask necessity frighten insult jew day people general hinder living losses due terrible losses hatred malice people would get immense benefit one another 
evening night visions baby willow fish slaughtered geese marfa looking profile like bird wants drink pale pitiful face rothschild faces moved sides muttered losses 
tossed side side got bed five times play fiddle 
morning got effort went hospital 
maxim nikolaitch told put cold compress head gave powders tone expression face yakov realized bad case powders would use 
went home afterwards reflected death would nothing benefit would eat drink pay taxes offend people man lies grave one year hundreds thousands one reckoned gain would enormous 
man life meant loss death meant gain 
reflection course one yet bitter mortifying order world strange life given man passes away without benefit sorry die home soon saw fiddle sent pang heart felt sorry 
could take fiddle grave would left forlorn thing would happen birch copse pine forest 
everything world wasted would wasted yakov went hut sat doorway pressing fiddle bosom 
thinking wasted profitless life began play know plaintive touching tears trickled cheeks 
harder thought mournfully fiddle wailed 
latch clicked rothschild appeared gate 
walked across half yard boldly seeing yakov stopped short seemed shrink together probably terror began making signs hands though wanted show fingers clock
