perhaps would take child return fifteen pounds 
old woman could would soon make bit useful 
john kind hearted chap would treat well years boy would make useful nipper board boat 
john hammond sent case put 
well said think could brass would mighty useful law stand got talked parish might come upon money 
john one others said 
best plan would two us go parson ask matter stands

clergyman upon consulted said thought arrangement good one 
parish authorities asked find money father funeral therefore say matter unless called upon take child

three days sailing made little way morning evening breeze

ran companion heard coil rope thrown door leapt ran speed men quarters 
feet hatch battened 
bad job sir dimchurch said 
got idea 
looked fastenings two hatches came twenty minutes ago looked right 
afraid cut comrades throats 
fear dimchurch 
think better know sir require good deal thinking 
suppose meddle us present course sooner later 
well dimchurch first step bring mess tables portable things forward make barricade 
also obtain two three barrels water stock food time comes may rate able make stout resistance 
good idea sir 
set work 
short time aid tubs provisions barrels water bales goods barricade built across bow vessel forming triangular enclosure fourteen feet side 
arms collected placed inside done general feeling satisfaction could least sell lives dearly 
sir next step dimchurch asked 
give orders ready carry 
thought nothing present said 
fancy better allow make first move even advantage attacking dark could hardly hope overcome four times number 
would tough job certainly sir worst comes worst might try 
must come quite worst dimchurch take step 
evening approached moors heard descending companion 
buzz talk came rushing forward 
reached door fore aft portions ship men opened fire upon poured shot 
seven eight fell others dashed forward 
seamen lined barricade made strenuous resistance 
cutlass clashed moorish yatagan moors crowded together use guns could gather closely front sailors stood unable break barricade 
last many fallen rest retired 
three four sailors received less severe wounds none absolutely disabled 
tom stevens fought pluckily among rest ready shouts encouragement cutlass taken use instead dirk wherever pressure severe 
moors retired dimchurch two others went outside barricade piled heavy bales door first carrying dead moors 
hardly attack us way sir said turn next time 
yes six number killed probably several badly wounded ought good chance success make dash dark 
waited night fallen 
said think lift hatchway dimchurch pretty hard try anyhow man said 
roll tub give chance using strength 
although able move slightly utmost efforts failed lift inch two 
piled many ropes sir think others get tubs join shall able move thing 
wait minute dimchurch 
let man make sure musket loaded 
short pause firelocks carefully examined

slowly hatchway yielded great effort pushed far enough man crawl 
pieces wood shoved corner hold hatch open men lifted stood clear 
clamber dimchurch look round 
many deck dozen far make sir 
jabbering away among disputing say best way get us

matters stand asked stood among 
killed six wounded eight ten first attack upon us shot five 
rest battened 
better remain present 
well gilmore congratulate recaptured ship 
bad affair lost nine men killed far concerned done splendidly 
afraid shall get pretty bad wigging allowing get though certainly bolts hatchways right changed watch 
course see ought placed man sentry 
always mighty easy wise event 
expect rascals pretty nearly cut wood away round bolts watch changed set work completed job 
shall however able investigate get malta 
blocked door fore parts ship said think would well place sentry hatch might turn tables upon us 
certainly 
badly wounded dimchurch got slash across cheek sir nothing speak 
well take post hatch present 
stevens may well go guard door 
able tell us least mischief 
think however fight pretty well taken resign fate 
bad job forster said sat together gun 
awfully sorry forster afraid getting 
question 
one thing forster 
put sentry hatchway neither much blame disaster 
man could hardly cut away woodwork without hearing 
certainly wish state report took watch left sentry placed ought certainly done came watch eight clock 
kind gilmore wish take blame upon shoulders responsibility wholly mine 
ought reminded put man question never gave matter thought blunder cost us nine good seamen 
shall lucky escape tremendous wigging 
must bear well 
talking sailors busy splicing shrouds 
done two men swarmed mast means halliards 
hoisted shrouds fastened round mast making taut means lanyards 
sails still standing flapping loosely light breeze sheets hauled vessel began move water 
two days later anchored valetta harbor 
goes forster said stepped boat report 
depends sort man admiral surprised ordered take court martial 
oh hope exclaimed 
wish would let go share blame 
thought forster said commanding officer must make report 
two hours later forster returned 
right gilmore said boat came alongside 
course got wigging 
admiral read report looked fierce tiger 
sentry placed prisoners admit sir said entirely overlooked 
quite conscious conduct indefensible certainly paid heavily 
smart trick taking shrouds admiral said though one would thought would shot cut 
expected sir said seemed think good joke prisoner preferred wait till driven thirst 
suppose men sold lives dearly asked 
yes sir replied 
taken surprise certainly accounted one man 
doubtless mr forster yes sir cut two cease fighting saw lost 
suppose thought duty majesty take care said slyly 
afraid sir said moment thought duty towards duty 
smiled grimly 
doubt mr forster 
well committed blunder hope lesson future 
indeed sir said 
started question 
junior officer seems behaved well said 
extremely well sir said 
wish done well 
plan forming barricade across bow little force ample defend excellent said 
also blocking door communication bulkhead well thought final escape hatchway sudden attack upon enemy well carried 
make note name 
suppose old junior sir yet sixteen promoted ship boy quarter deck three weeks ago 
promoted ship boy admiral said surprise 
give detailed account fight led promotion also life far knew 
finished admiral said must singular lad gilmore likely prove honor navy 
bring hour morrow shall glad see 
may go forget future charge prisoners must always place guard 
unknowingly done good turn gilmore expect admiral interested would let easily 
must put best uniform first time go morrow 
well afraid felt shaky heard account admiral 
say evident kindly man told many questions ask 
well feel good deal easier mind may guess forster said 
went ashore felt like bad boy flogging 
dare say shall get little hotter captain wigging talk courts martial 
saw goods board craft rumpus took place fancy moor captured plundered well laden merchantman 
case prize money worth good round sum admiral gets picking still inclined look favourably matter 
comes boat take prisoners 
doubt hanged especially able give satisfactory explanation fate merchantman 
soon got rid overhaul bales see contents 
last prisoners taken ashore forster gilmore went examined cargo 
proved consist valuable eastern stuffs broad cloths silks turkish carpets 
could better forster said must worth lot money add nice little handful prize money shall get return home 
ought give us good round sum proserpine three moorish vessels though think worth much holds nearly empty fancy cruising short time 
fellow however rich prize certainly hard luck falling us 
fancy ship pillaged frenchman italian likely latter 
think many french merchantmen likely cargo intended genoa whence good part might sent paris 
well makes little difference us destination proceeds certainly destined enrich us instead original consignees 
next morning put best uniform first time landing forster ascended nix mangare stairs called admiral

one morning day broke seen quarter mile frigate 
gun fired across bows seeing escape impossible hauled colors without resistance 
forster gilmore officers brought prizes went board made reports 
forster predicted severely reprimanded placed sentry prisoners consideration fact already spoken admiral captain less severe would otherwise 
gilmore hand warmly commended 
managed extremely well captain said showed fully deserved promotion 
chapter v pirate hold furious placed hands dockyard people set work immediately repair damages large quantities provisions brought stores shore 
generally sharp forster said say must something wind 
general opinion board ship double gangs workers put three days reported ready sea 
captain came board half hour later spoke first lieutenant orders issued get anchors set sail 
head pointed west left harbor general opinion bound gibraltar 
leaked however afternoon sailing sealed orders would hardly case bound gibraltar innumerable discussions among sailors destination 
could meant cruise along west coast france return england join fleet got ready important operation say bill one men asked old sailor sat quietly taking part discussion 
well asks said say bound west indies 
west indies bill makes think well thinks seems wanted 
french got stronger fleet 
well got strong fleet toulon quite strong one brest 
yes may think pretty safe lick either places come fight us fair whereas west indies good bit stronger 
many ports islands speak good deal scattered might moment come upon us double strength 
ever bill ay two three times 
respects could better buy fruit bacca rum next nothing officers give chance 
lor games niggers circumvent would make laugh land old black woman come basket full cocoa nuts 
officer steps examines look right 
perhaps breaks one full milk good 
go buy officer looks 
woman hands two three gives last one winks eye 
say anything drop sixpence hand among coppers pay others quite sold officer orders boat lie till comes back 
returns quite astonished find crew three sheets wind 
bring sugar canes half thick wrist looking innocent may ends sealed bits pith open one end find joints bored cane full rum 
mind lads fools touch new strong rank bottle would knock silly 
worst fever catches hold fever joke 
eats good dinner twelve clock buried palisades six called yellow jack 
country enjoy reasonable fruit perhaps small sup rum must beware drinking right 
islands beautiful downright beautiful many places troubles look west indies like gardens feathery sorts trees mountains everything want nature 
hot bill speak cool summer time 
winter right summer would like lie naked day cold water poured 
still one gets accustomed time 
see always excitement kind 
pirates frenchmen spaniards regard cross two 
hide among islands pop least expect 
always keep eyes head cutlass handy go ashore 
worst call mulattoes whity brown sort chaps neither one thing nice cut throat lot 
sailor drinks much loses boat like murdered morning 
hate chaps like poison 
scores small craft manned prey upon negroes honest merry lot bad sailors either way 
sometimes four five pirate craft go together many good size carry lot guns 
make island head quarters 
niggers may turn slaves 
thousands islands least say scattered mere sand spots others goodish size 
well hope west indies 
plenty amusement plenty fighting done like know sailor want 
hum approval picture certainly tempting 
six days run favourable wind passed straits without touching gibraltar held west twenty four hours 
sealed orders opened soon known throughout ship indeed west indies bound 
ship course changed 
teneriffe passed stopped day take fresh water vegetables st vincent 
head turned westward three weeks later furious anchored port royal 
captain went shore visit admiral returned news furious cruise coast cuba 
exact position french fleet unknown last heard neighborhood island 
must keep sharp look captain said bring back news whereabouts catch sight course catch tartar french ships carry heavier guns sail faster 
speedy however class hope able show clean pair heels 
addition told three piratical craft rendezvous island south coast cuba committing great depredations 
number merchantmen missed keep sharp look clip wings 
size asked first lieutenant 
one said cutter carrying eight guns long tom two schooners carrying six guns broadside known whether long tom probability 
would rather formidable opponents caught together carry many guns long toms vastly powerful anything 
think pity furnish ships station long twenty four would worth nearly broadsides 
mr farrance somehow people home get regular groove fill ships eight ten pounders say one long twenty four would worth dozen 
catch one pirates shall confiscate long guns use 
would capital plan sir 
well glad shall something look besides french fleet may hundred miles away 
ay thousand captain added 
standing far captain heard conversation 
heart beat high thought possibility fight murderous pirates 
three weeks cruised coast cuba 
saw sign whatever french fleet time time heard native craft pirates 
natives differed somewhat widely head quarters pests agreed island lying middle dangerous shoals 
one day saw smoke rising fifteen miles away shaped course 
approached found rose vessel enveloped flames 
european ship captain said neared 
send officer boat row round gather particulars fate 
see boats near afraid work pirates 
watched boat intent interest rowed round ship 
doubt whatever work pirates officer said return 
bulwarks burnt away could make several piles deck looked like dead men 
send man mast head farrance tell scan horizon carefully sail 
say ship burning three hours 
sooner man reached top mast called sail ho away mr farrance shouted 
port bow sir 
make say schooner topsails 
ship course changed every rag sail put upon 
first lieutenant climbed upper crosstrees long look telescope returned deck 
say certainly one schooners search sir doubt whether light wind much chance overhauling 
try anyhow captain said 
probably steering rendezvous following may least get important information 
day chase continued apparent change position two vessels 
furious kept course night satisfaction board found morning broke certainly gained schooner mainsails visible 
twelve clock low bank sand sighted ahead schooner entered channel two hours later 
furious hove outside shoal 
sand extended long distance several breaks masthead net work channels could made 
great disappointment crew furious give chase see schooner four miles way easy sail 
awkward place mr farrance captain said need deal examination go farther 
first thing sail round note sound various channels 
wish would go aloft glass see whether ground higher rest 
place would naturally point rendezvous 
lieutenant farrance went aloft presently returned 
clump green trees said ten miles 
schooner nearing think though certain make masts another craft lying 
well something located captain said 
must find best get work time 
may well begin examining channels 
four boats lowered rowed mouths nearest 
sounding operations quickly showed three two feet water somewhat deeper still two feet less water furious drew 
deep part narrow winding 
may one schooner gone captain said 
doubt draws three four feet less knowing passage perfectly could get easily 
hope however shall find something deeper presently 
next three days spent circumnavigating sand banks sounding various channels last captain obliged admit none deep enough furious although fully half dozen vessels lighter draught might enter 
ready run fair risk mr farrance said daren send boat expedition force especially doubt thrown batteries strengthen position 
must number cannon taken ships captured 
would certainly desperate enterprise first lieutenant agreed say dangerous attempted 
gilmore forster said midshipmen met dinner always full ideas suggest way might get afraid laughed 
possible way see would sail away get together number native craft make dash place 
would advantage native craft boats one others said scoffingly 
great advantage would dozen native craft men would scattered decks instead crowded boats would therefore able land comparatively little loss 
upon word one seniors said think something gilmore idea 
course would shallow one would choose night enough breeze take quietly along 
rate run risk snubbed mention one lieutenants 
pon word think feasible seem 
dinner midshipman went mr peters third lieutenant saluted 
lieutenant asked 
well sir idea gilmore may worth anything certainly seemed something 
ideas generally worth something 
midshipman explained plan 
certainly something peters said 
beggar boy ideas rate mention mr farrance 
mr farrance first pooh poohed idea thinking concluded would well rate lay captain 
pon word seem feasible captain said 
could tow boats came pirates fire men could get boats shelter 
one hand would required steer vessel rest would remain sight enemy near enough make dash either shore pirates craft case might 
good idea really brilliant idea well worth putting effect 
besides vessels could carry one two small guns keep enemy fire extent 
send gilmore 
minutes entered captain cabin cap hand 
mr farrance tells mr gilmore idea collecting number native craft shallow draught might attack pirates hope success 
idea sir occurred spur moment 
well inclined regard feasible one captain said 
dozen boats kind would carry greater part ship crew couple light cannon board would able answer enemy fire 
attack manner propose send boats towing behind native craft enemy fire becomes really heavy men take places shelter close enough make dash 
suggestion offer sir 
plan taking boats certainly seems good one 
captain smiled little 
accustomed plans approved midshipmen 
however said think work 
suggestion occur mention mr farrance 
really obliged idea great credit sharpness 
thank sir said retired 
hour later frigate sailing away sand banks 
old man say midshipmen asked rejoined 
thinks something idea course greatly improved 
means send boats towing behind native craft fire gets heavy men take towed perfect shelter near enough make rush 
intends put gun two native boats keep enemy fire bit approach 
improvement forster said certainly seems gilmore found way dilemma 
disposed laugh suggestion eager congratulate captain expressed approval adopted 
furious sailed direct port royal 
fear pirates would abandon island would naturally take retirement furious admission defeat 
course open boat attack would consider strong enough beat attempt without difficulty 
arriving port royal lieutenant farrance went ashore search suitable craft 
difficulty buying dozen old native boats 
procured large quantity cane lashed bottom boats using sufficient quantity keep afloat even riddled balls 
carpenters set work make platforms bows carry seven pounder gun 
three days work completed furious started putting two men boats taking tow 
five days later arrived sand spits preparations made attack 
lying low water keeping line behind furious native craft would altogether invisible central islands pirates would aware method attack 
greater portion men told forty remaining board furious 
ready hour nightfall men took places native craft fastening boats stern case 
sails got following single file entered channel found deepest 
leading boat kept sounding easy matter wind light rate progress exceed mile hour 
posted first lieutenant boat leader dimchurch tom stevens among crew 
dimchurch exchanged places another seaman tom allowed place special solicitation 
fought stoutly fight moorish prize much attached 
obliged sir would take 
right said first lieutenant let stow away bow till fighting begins 
accordingly tom curled gun 
two three morning trees central island made five hundred yards away 
presently projecting point heavy mass could made cannon fired 
shot flew overhead effect instantaneous 
shouts heard shore sound oars rowlocks 
take boats lieutenant shouted 
two lines lights port holes showed positions two vessels men native craft left work guns opened fire 
minute two return evident greater portion crew ashore 
battery first fired kept steady discharge boats almost invisible shot flew wildly overhead splashed harmlessly water 
gunners board disregarded maintained steady fire ports enemy vessels 
came answering flashes shot little damage 
attacking party got within hundred yards pirate ships lieutenant gave signal boats cheer dashed forward full speed 
received instructions act case two vessels found dividing made respective quarters 
race short sharp officer urging men fullest exertions 
instant alongside oars cast aside men drawing cutlasses leapt feet endeavored climb 
thrust back boarding pikes axes weapons kinds last managed get foothold aft 
vain endeavored get deck sides high 
finding left half crew made way boat forward along side pirate vessel clambered bowsprit shrouds 
men boats seeing followed example 
unnoticed 
fierce fight raging quarter deck shouting prodigious 
thirty men gathered led way aft 
arrival opportune attacking party lieutenant vastly outnumbered pirates although fighting stoutly penned bulwark difficulty defended 
illustration leads party take enemy rear cheer party rushed aft taking pirates rear 
many cut rest fell back confused unexpected attack 
time lads lieutenant shouted 
throw upon drive back although pirates still fought desperately knowing mercy would extended steady valor sailors much 
last pirate captain cut dimchurch fall men entirely lost heart 
threw arms many jumped overboard swam ashore 
loud cheer burst sailors resistance came end 
fight still raging board ship lieutenant ordered men another boat row 
unseen pirates reached bow climbed deck 
soon gained footing rushed aft 
rear attack decided struggle five minutes 
daylight breaking able see line storehouses islands together large number huts 
greater portion men ordered land fugitives ships hunted 
taken refuge battery mouth harbor open land side soon stormed defenders cut 
huts searched burnt storehouses opened 
found contain enormous quantity goods spoil evidently many ships men set work transfer prizes full native craft 
boat sent directly fighting news captain success gained morning another message sent saying would take four five days transfer stores ships furious consequence hoisted anchor gone short cruise away dangerous proximity sands 
afternoon third day large cutter seen approaching 
lieutenant farrance ordered native craft towed behind small islet hidden sight vessel entering harbor crews take places captured vessels 
done guns loaded men stood quarters 
new comer approached without apparently entertaining suspicion anything unusual happened huts destroyed hidden groves trees 
came abreast guns run lieutenant shouted call upon surrender vessels prizes majesty frigate furious surrender sink hoarse shout fury astonishment captain called back never surrender schooners poured broadsides immense damage killing large numbers pirates 
cannon fired answer haste effect 
two broadsides fired cutter blew tremendous explosion shook vessels keel threw many men 
smoke cleared away cutter disappeared 
whether shot reached magazine whether blown desperate commander never known single survivor crew picked 
work loading completed storehouses destroyed fire two schooners sailed followed native craft boats towing behind 
victory little cost 
three men killed seventeen wounded exception thirty prisoners part wounded whole pirate force annihilated 
captain already visited scene rowed soon received news success expedition 
lieutenant farrance despatch several officers noted distinguished conduct 
among gilmore lieutenant gave great credit manner boarded pirate sudden attack upon rear enemy converted distinctly perilous situation success 
tell gilmore one midshipmen jestingly said go like shall send coventry 
unbearable always get front 
great rejoicing among merchants port royal furious returned two prizes became known third destroyed nest pirates completely broken 
following day sent admiral 
lad said wish tell although usual captain acknowledge official despatches acted ideas young midshipman captain marker done full justice verbal report 
idea showed great ingenuity although surprise complete even attack made ships boats would probably successful detracts way merit suggestion 
course years serve yet pass promise soon shall still appointment mate employment distinguish 
thank much sir said saluting retired 
three days ship prizes native craft unloaded contents found great value marks upon goods evident least twenty three merchantmen must captured pillaged none ever heard sailed reasonably concluded must burnt board murdered 
case atrocious prisoners tried condemned death executed batches 
little doubt pirates must agents various ports kept informed sailing ships means ascertaining parties 
furious sailed four days return time cruised northern coast cuba 
one day sailing along stretch high cliffs ship war suddenly appeared narrow inlet followed two others 
furious headed round three french frigates pursuit started way back 
wind light though every stitch canvas set evident hour sailing one least pursuers gained steadily 
french ship would indeed gained done yawed occasionally fired bow chasers 
furious shifted two broadside guns stern reply although aim good one two hits made distance still great accurate shooting 
wish two frenchmen little slower captain said first lieutenant 
little farther behind started think half mile astern 
continues travel present rate close us sunset 
size make doubt give good account could hope two consorts came could expect beat three 
could fall one cruisers would fight willingly 
yes odds much us present sir 
say could fight separately could hardly hope beat three 
make go water faster far see 
every sail seems best 
nothing pray either another frigate wind 
sure wind would help us still might 
think sir lieutenant said two hours later one wishes going fulfilled 
cloud rising rapidly larboard bow color appearance seems going tornado 
welcome indeed captain said 
hit ten times last half hour nearest ship three quarters mile away 
five minutes later captain said certainly tornado 
hands reduce sail 
waste moment lads us three minutes 
moment vessel scene bustle men swarmed rigging urged greatest exertions voices officers appearance heavens 
frigate behind held three four minutes longer sheets let fly immediately scene wild confusion 
ready captain said grimly turn turtle 
much shall ready 
line white foam seen approaching speed race horse last man reached deck 
would give great deal captain said time get light spars 
get ready small fore try sail small stay sail run mizzen 
minute later storm upon 
blinding sheet spray driven almost force grape shot swept ship followed deafening roar force wind seemed lift ship bodily water 
heeled thought founder even noise storm three loud crashes heard three masts lofty hamper went side 
thank god lieutenant exclaimed saved hands axes knives began cutting away wreckage 
time two try sails hoisted blew bolt ropes 
think sir first lieutenant shouted lash hawser hamper hang act floating anchor bring head wind well thought mr farrance captain shouted back means 
order given immediately carried 
tangle ropes spars ship strongest hawser attached soon drifted past cable tightened vessel head began come slowly wind 
delay fate bit captain said hope delay unless get sail crawl coast 
get ready strongest try sails case may wanted 
minutes sails got ready present nothing hang wreckage 
shore miles away spite floating anchor drift great 
crew furious time breathe pitch dark nothing could seen save white heads waves every moment threatened overwhelm 
trace frigate hotly pursued could seen 
god rest souls captain said earnestly 
afraid gone 
fair fight one strives much damage possible catastrophe awful 
trust two took warning time 
hope 
lee island passed shortly began would partially sheltered 
hope first fate terrible indeed sir awful perhaps know may become long 
doubt captain said 
unless wind drops chops round fate sealed hours see ship grinding bones rocky shore 
dark see know surely approaching 
day broke shore made little half mile away 
captain called crew together 
lads shouted spite efforts voice heard yards away everything done ship could done see efforts vain 
trust get ashore far see present rocks almost precipitous high spray flies right 
thank good conduct ship commission sure know die preserve calm courage till end 
go stations remain strike man must make best fight life 
men went quietly 
mr farrance stood watching shore telescope 
presently exclaimed see sir break cliff know far goes looks might opening inlet 
nearly opposite shift hawser bow stern swing round probably drift right creek 
means let us make attempt captain said 
thank god hope escape us men sprang feet alacrity heard news 
another hawser brought firmly spliced one use beyond bulwark forward 
led along outside shrouds fastened bitts astern mizzen mast 
done first hawser cut bulwark forward ship swung round almost instantly 
soon headed dead shore raffle long served floating anchor cut adrift try sail hoisted stump foremast six good men wheel vessel surged shorewards force gale every man board holding breath 
opening ship length across driven wind steered greatest care furious shot quickly surely propelled oars 
great shout relief burst whole crew proceeding hundred yards along narrow channel passage suddenly widened pool quarter mile across 
let go anchor captain cried scarce spoken great anchor went thundering 
pay chain gradually next order check gets half way across 
order obeyed vessel head swung round less minute riding quietly great waves came rolling entrance broke foam shore inlet 
quiet roar din almost startling 
clouds could seen flying past rugged masses breast pool sheltered wind lofty sides scarcely rippled waves rolled made glass 
word heard captain spoke 
least men thank god miraculous escape 
trust man board ship offer fervent thanks wonderfully brought us jaws death 
every head bared two three minutes sound heard board ship 
captain replaced hat men went quietly duties 
chapter vi narrow escape hardly anchored gale showed signs breaking hours sun shone wind subsided 
destruction timber hillsides prodigious large spaces entirely cleared 
captain first lieutenant anxious consultation 
every boat gone masts rigging 
practically hostile country although spain declared war us gave every assistance french left ports open 
weeks probably would openly throw scale us 
clear must communicate port royal somehow captain said certainly clear 
nearest port may miles miles mountain encumbered fallen trees would almost impossible get 
heard always bands fugitive slaves mountains would sure attack us 
sea might possibly make shift build boat 
certainly lack timber lying round plenty sail cloth sails could fit fairly well 
would journey fully thousand miles seems feasible plan 
small craft say forty feet long might built got ready sea course week 
say certainly sir 
amount labor disposal might built even sooner 
plenty handy men board could give efficient help carpenter gang 
suppose would build rather ship boat yes think 
could build one half inch planks fill seams well oakum give couple coats paint 
let shallow draft plenty beam 
course decked might meet another tornado 
crew would consist officer ten men 
vessel difficulty reaching port royal 
carpenters told carry work 
many hands help wish captain said head gang 
first shall get planks sir make raft 
means get shore choose trunks would suitable purpose sure find plenty 
find suitable spot ship yard start work 
set gang men axes square trunks make ready sawing 
need six inches square finished couple double handed saws soon rip planks 
long think say sir help get ought ready start less week 
course ribs take time prepare keel stem stern post place planking take us long 
decked thompson 
sir yes think 
may meet weather like come well decked may feel assured reach port royal 
leave mr farrance draw lines 
think said first lieutenant like magnified launch greater beam larger draft water could perhaps best gained giving deep keel 
course must good deal higher water launch say good four feet deck 
need carry much ballast gain stability beam 
understand sir 
first thing done form raft 
ship crew soon work long raft constructed 
rope taken ashore made fast tree raft could hauled rapidly backwards forwards ship shore 
carpenter mates first land chief selected suitable point yard assistants scattered examining fallen trees cutting branches seemed suitable 
soon dragged yard 
strong gangs set work square carpenters cut planks 
first lieutenant remained encouraging work junior officers midshipmen divided among various gangs 
six clock furious signalled hands come board indeed done good day work 
pile planks lay ready used required 
carpenters made progress keel laboriously chopping straight trunk large tree 
evening next day finished placed position 
third day started shape stem stern posts head carpenter made thin planks templates ribs set others chop ribs fit 
two days ready fastening planks 
hundred fifty men get amazing amount labor work well heartily 
planks bent main strength fit places abundance nails necessary articles board sheathing finished two days 
rest work comparatively easy 
deck laid hull caulked painted two masts sails rigging prepared 
boat bulwarks considered would much better sea boat without case shipping sea water would run 
hatchways fore aft made small close fitting hatches covered tarpaulin 
captain delighted finished 
really fine boat said forty feet length fifteen beam 
taken longer build expected reckoned sufficiently difficulties 
everything however done make seaworthy us remain may feel sure reach port royal safely 
case gale sails must lowered lashed deck hands must go fasten hatchways securely 
ballast except stores think perfectly safe little chance capsizing 
beam depth keel said first lieutenant could possibly capsize 
case tornado masts might well taken used floating anchor keep head 
intend send sir send two officers captain said 
peters midshipman take place case disabled 
think robson turn special service 
next morning boat started soon daybreak ship crew watching till two white lug sails disappeared opening 
take strong party wood cutters captain said see make way top hill get idea country round 
expect shall see much interest well kept employed 
way get hawsers shore work frigate round bring broadside bear upon opening ought done first 
french may know place may learn spaniards 
two ships astern us probably got snug tornado struck weathered right though doubt much unless knew inlets could run 
escape likely taking trouble find became us 
may seen companion fate would hardly made us darkness 
still would certainly want report loss may sail along close inshore look timbers signs wreck 
think therefore advisable station well armed boat end cut tell row every half hour end see make either sailing rowing craft coming along shore 
see must retire end opening unless find place could hide till boat came abreast pounce capture 
would certainly good precaution sir 
see forgetting boats 
bless forget altogether well little dug carpenters made sending messages ship 
carry three 
glad would take couple hands row mouth entrance see place without great difficulty small party gun could stationed noticed boat coming 
understand sir 
lieutenant started returned hours later reported ledge twenty feet long twelve deep 
eight feet water edge twelve sir said noticeable one almost directly opposite 
pile rocks regularly four feet high along face gun crew would completely hidden 
get one hands board mr farrance go see 
one men climbed deck captain took place little dug 
reached ledge made careful inspection 
yes said ten men could certainly lie hidden rough parapet constructed look natural possible certainly unobserved incoming boat especially attention stern would directed inlet 
order mr forster one midshipmen go many men raft carry build parapet 
better take one rope ladders fix ledge means grapnel 
plenty building material among rocks fallen precipices 
must leave ingenuity make natural possible 
returned ship first lieutenant called forster gave captain orders 
take young gilmore said 
object make natural possible look fact rocks fallen behind lodged ledge 
height important boat coming along men would course lie till abreast cannon would withdrawn run last moment 
well sir best 
raft brought requisition found could carry twelve men 
dimchurch nine others chosen using oars paddles slowly made way spot 
difficult job make anything like natural wall forster said 
yes agreed see managed 
course could pile line stones would look least natural 
could get three four big chunks might filled small stones would impossible raise great blocks shelf 
ladder fixed climbed ledge 
reached found rough uneven consequently task difficult seemed 
way see forster said would blast trench six feet wide one foot deep men could lie hidden 
question whether captain afraid blasting might draw attention presence 
starting top hill came away said may able see whether habitations neighborhood 
couple men dug would able bring us news craft sight 
certainly see way 
forster made report captain said believe best plan 
top hill could see nothing forests part levelled could make sign smoke anywhere 
operation blasting done comparatively small charges occurring foot gorge like sound would hardly spread much surrounding country could course take care ship sight fired charges 
well begin morrow 
believe blasting tools store 
take gunner work comes within province 
following morning raft went midday number sharp explosions told work begun 
evening another series shots fired party returned news ground broken depth two feet ample size give men cover 
next morning rocks cleared seven pounder carriage tackle hoisting sent 
afternoon captain went dug inspected work expressed thoroughly satisfied 
garrison consisting officer ten men placed fort 
remained day returned ship darkness fell thought pretty certain one would try explore inlet night 
next morning another party told garrison duty man given two consecutive days fort 
fourth day dug returned haste ship post mouth gap reported two men war seen distance cruising close inshore 
mr farrance landed difficulty made way hill point near mouth opening commanded view sea 
point could easily see hulls ships telescope doubt whatever former antagonists furious 
watching time made four little black specks close shore 
examined closely hurried cove 
searching coast boats reported feared would 
news given little party battery dug came alert 
carpenters departure first boat employed building large gig pull twelve oars recalled ship magazines opened guns loaded 
guns larboard main deck brought upper deck port holes made boom trees built bow stern ship shore prevent craft getting inside 
thus prepared captain considered fully match two ships size knew nevertheless even beat might exposed attack still larger force unless assistance arrived jamaica 
think ship 
dug brought mr farrance back report sent orders party battery must possible sink boat boats entered ships war came must try work gun first shot would simply swept away enemy fire 
one shot aimed enemy rudder lie disabled ship keep heavy musketry fire aimed solely steersman 
hardly likely would attacked boats enemy would fully engaged furious even frenchmen would means climbing eight feet precipitous rock 
dug went entrance bringing back news progress made enemy boats 
three hours time first made mr farrance little boat reported two three hundred yards entrance 
board ship listened anxiously slight bend narrow passage prevented seeing battery 
presently boom cannon heard followed cheer told little garrison successful two three minutes rattle musketry 
stopped dug went fort returned news two boats come abreast one sunk cannon fort crew picked boat rowed hastily back suffering good deal musketry fire operation carried 
act one captain said shall look act two 
go mr farrance place whence saw may sure great deal signalling consultation make step 
accordingly landed went look 
two vessels lying close sails aback 
fortunate two boats attempted explore passage returned load wounded survivors late companion boats passing fro two ships 
awkward question decide captain said 
course know well enough ship must gun shows tell capable making defense beyond single gun battery ledge 
hour change position end time sails filled two vessels headed mouth inlet 
evidently concluded english ship lying disabled 
two officers hurried back furious gave orders prepare attack 
men stood posts 
presently gun fort boomed cheering followed sound evident shot taken effect smashed rudder one french ships 
several guns fired reply minute later bowsprit leading ship came view 
men waited could see whole vessel crashing broadside every gun board furious poured bow 
effect tremendous hole ten twelve feet wide torn bow ship swept end end balls splinters shrieks groans arose told execution heavy 
evident battle already half far concerned 
room enough little inlet maneuver light wind bring broadside bear furious another crashing broadside latter vessel completed discomfiture 
vessel came side disabled fort helm would act 
captain lowered boats tried get head round smashed fire furious two vessels lay together side side helpless reply efficient way incessant fire kept upon 
frenchmen possible brave men circumstances position hopeless suffering terribly ten minutes one hauled flag 
tremendous burst cheering broke furious 
lost two men killed four five wounded bullets french topmen 
also struck twice balls bow chaser second ship extent damage loss life board french frigates frightful 
sixty men killed eighty wounded first ship thirty killed still wounded boats second vessel 
captain harker went board captures receive swords commanders 
done best gentlemen said one circumstances could done 
ten instead two result must 
boats got seen situation would understood position impossible one 
room manoeuvring even one damaged shot little battery position would practically unchanged could possibly brought broadsides bear upon us 
french captains much mortified disaster bowed silently 
fortune war sir one said certainly could anticipated would wonderfully placed defense 
agree case hopeless first compliment upon dispositions certainly admirable 
officers perfectly liberty captain said crews must placed partial confinement third always deck 
surgeon come board assist attending wounded 
considerable portion crew furious put board french frigate eclaire set work dismantle 
masts spars rigging transferred furious erected place shattered stumps thrown overboard 
thus four days hardest work furious placed fighting trim 
preparations immediately made sailing 
furious led way towing behind dismantled hull whole prisoners carried 
prize crew sixty placed board actif 
half way jamaica squadron three vessels sighted 
preparations made throw eclaire ships proved hostile long evident english 
approached rapidly rounded near furious crews manned yards greeted tremendous cheers 
officer command rowed furious 
boat neared ship friends recognized mr peters robson sitting stern 
miracle captain harker officer cried came deck 
lieutenant brought us news dismasted lying helpless little inlet see french equipment couple prizes almost accuse brought us fool errand 
must appearance facts case simple told story fight 
battle practically first shot fired said 
two french ships lost upwards seventy killed hundred wounded four men killed two wounded 
place designed nature specially defense could better adapted us 
see captain ingham said made advantages 
plan laying broadside entrance getting cannon one side building boom prevent vessel getting behind excellent 
well splendid victory little loss 
french certainly showed little discretion thus running trap prepared 
course could tell expect least whatever might cost ought sent strong boat division reconnoitre 
english captain would risked vessel way 
little delay voyage jamaica continued 
two relief party went straight remained furious case fall french fleet 
little squadron entered port royal received enthusiastic welcome ships station 
prizes bought service handed dockyard thorough refit

quite liberty accept like captain farrance said 
till vessel gets hands dockyard men nothing whatever 
may tell good deal unrest island among slaves 
doings french revolutionists excitement caused becoming patrons mulattoes might expected spread greatly feared trouble may come

badly treated apt try better 
still always case

well sir 
accept invitations overnight 
say mr gilmore

first thing take boat row new command 
handsome boat evidently designed fast weatherly 
beggars know build boats much better fight said examined 
assuredly anything like light wind would run away sylph 
admiral right said chance caught

course shall dimchurch boatswain take one watch youngster 
hard catch something 
rowed round cutter two three times returned shore

overhauled pretended peaceful fishermen traders search always brought light concealed arms cases captured goods 
boats burned crews mostly mulattoes sprinkling negroes rascals whose countenances sufficiently villainous justify hanged without trial put ashore admiral given instructions burden prisoners would closely guarded would therefore weaken crew brought port royal would take prison accommodation 
last one day schooner rather bigger sighted 
appearance rakish little doubt character 
sail crowded l agile 
schooner nearly fast end six hours chase still two miles ahead 
suddenly headed shore disappeared among trees 
l agile proceeded course opposite mouth inlet pirate entered 
getting dark decided wait morning send boat reconnoitre 
forgotten said harman way two french frigates told ran trap mean caught help 
l agile remained hove night morning lowered boat four hands commanded dimchurch ordered row obtained fair view enemy observe far possible preparation made defense 
absent half hour returned saying schooner lying anchored sails stowed far end inlet half mile long nearly wide broadside bearing entrance 
large said plenty room us maneuver 
make number guns carried yes sir mounted four guns side say part ten pounders 
think reckon upon taking 
guns heavier metal long tom make deficiency numbers 
l agile put easy sail would suffice give manoeuvring powers headed mouth inlet 
half way suddenly two hidden batteries mounting three guns opened upon 
drop anchor shouted finish gentlemen go farther 
schooner time opened fire half mile range guns inflict much damage upon cutter 
lying two batteries engaged broadside guns firing grape long tom sent shot alternately 
quarter hour fire silenced three guns dismounted men working fled precipitately 
take boat spike remaining guns dimchurch said want bother 
minutes dimchurch returned cutter accomplished mission 
anchor got proceeded attack schooner 
l agile casualties trifling one killed three wounded slightly 
sailed inlet replied pivot gun fire enemy 
every shot splinters seen fly schooner side much discomfiture pirate gunners whose aim became wild scarcely shot struck l agile 
within hundred yards schooner helm put cutter swept round opened fire two broadside guns 
shots scarcely rung harman touched shoulder 
look sir said 
turned saw vessel emerging side channel closed trees unperceived anybody aboard cutter 
aim evidently get sea 
cutter size l agile carried six ten pounders 
schooner enticed us said doubt nothing fight 
take head round said settle cutter first 
schooner come assistance minutes sails furled 
accordingly ranged new comer furious contest ensued 
engaged two broadside guns long tom time kept two guns playing upon schooner crew busy getting sail 
long tom served dimchurch every shot went crashing side pirate cutter fire two broadside guns almost equally effective 
keep lads shouted shall finish come 
spoke shot long tom struck cutter mainmast tottered moment fell side towards l agile sails hamper entirely prevented crew working guns 
another five minutes fire kept crew seen leaping overboard presently man stood shouted surrendered 
schooner coming fast 
let escape shouted enough trying get away 
run aboard minute two vessels crashed together headed harman dimchurch l agile crew sprang board schooner 
pirate crew evidently discouraged fate consort complete failure plan capture l agile 
captain gigantic mulatto fought desperately two three principal men 
one charged engaged another would killed tom stevens sprung forward caught blow cutlass 
sword flew man hand tom cut 
dimchurch engaged single handed contest great mulatto captain 
strong sailor could difficulty parry ruffian blows skill made inequality strength exchanges laid man low clever thrust 
fall leader completed discomfiture pirates sprang overboard made shore remained cut sailors 
last masters ship crew gave three lusty cheers 
permit waste precious time rejoicing 
knew though accomplished much still great deal done prizes might even yet recaptured got sea 
without moment delay therefore sent boat take possession cutter 
sail wreckage cleared away boat proceeded tow inlet 
meantime warp taken l agile schooner sails latter lowered sailed proudly second prize tow 
fairly sea crew began repair damages 
five men killed eleven wounded 
several latter however able lend hand 
shot holes l agile first patched pieces plank covered canvas afterwards given coat paint 
schooner taken hand got something like ship shape order sails hoisted ten men harman placed board work 
cutter taken tow three men left board steer 
late afternoon repairs completed 
sailing rough examination made holds two vessels great satisfaction l agile crew found contain considerable amount booty 
probable storehouse somewhere said thirty available men would madness try land certainly two thirds scoundrels escaped swimming craft must carried nearly hundred men altogether overmatched 
well certainly right count upon success arrangements exceedingly good 
doubt expected us leave batteries alone position placed could peppered us hotly engaged schooner case would probably easy victory 
cleverly laid trap ought succeeded 
would sir dimchurch said turned schooner settled cutter could come assistance 
credit largely due said shot took mast turning point fight 
completely crippled luckily fell towards us altogether prevented returning fire 
proud crew sailed port royal two prizes 
rowed flagship received hearty greeting 
come empty handed see mr gilmore admiral said lucky indeed take two ships size one 
took time sir said see report 
admiral gave look surprise opened document 
first ran eye read attentively 
finished said fought gallant action mr gilmore gallant action 
indeed long odds two vessels considerably size manned far heavier crews besides two batteries 
excellent idea leave vessel first engaged turn upon second one 
tried fight would almost certainly overcome succeeded cool enough grasp fact schooner anchor sails would able come friend assistance minutes acted promptly conclusions 
oldest officer service could done better 
congratulate heartily conduct 
contents cargoes prizes say sir 
three vessels hands time examine certainly contain number bales various sorts 
opened one contained british goods 
doubt pick cargoes captured admiral said go ascertain 
nothing else afternoon matter interest well 
may well let gig row back take mine 
accordingly gig sent back l agile orders two boats lowered twenty men ready go two prizes 
soon admiral came board hatchways opened men brought number bales 
found contain fine cloths material women dresses china ironmongery carpets goods british manufacture 
vessel contained sugar coffee ginger spices products islands 
enough said admiral think shall far wrong put value two cargoes 
two vessels sell apiece prize money altogether even putting aside portion share handsome amount proceeds 
advantage belonging squadron 
case share would worth anything like 
way since absent received account prize money earned furious mediterranean capture french frigates 
amounts 
course midshipman share large probably indeed exceed see pirate hunting west indies command even small craft pays enormously better midshipman board frigate 
indeed sir though would fortune midshipman 
well calculations value cargoes ships correct get ten times amount 
flag one officer share men portion something like apiece 
captures like laughed become rich man 
rowed away ship returned l agile gladdened hearts harman crew news value captures 
l agile remained another week harbor time signs recent conflict removed received draft men sufficient bring crew former level 
set sail 
cruised fortnight one morning getting dimchurch ran reported sighted two sails suspiciously near 
one said looks full rigged ship large schooner 
look said putting clothes ran deck 
yes certainly looks suspicious said examined telescope head towards 
looks large schooner sir said dimchurch 
yes larger pirates generally little doubt character 
far think ten miles sir say got land breeze becalmed 
look water say carry wind us pretty close 
every sail cutter could carry hoisted approached two vessels rapidly 
four miles sails schooner filled began move water 
long chase said cutter light wings good chance overhauling 
sails ship anyhow sir harman said 
mr harman foul play going least doubt 
fact crew making effort haul sheets come meet us proof 
think duty board see taken place 
even allow schooner escape shall light upon day doubt 
low water said examining merchantman carefully telescope either cargo value pirates allowed remain scuttled 
afraid sir dimchurch said certainly lower water first saw 
right dimchurch scoundrels scuttled 
please god shall get founders oh stronger wind think could row quicker sail sir 
gig might go fast cutter boat would able keep pace 
well make preparations lowering 
heaven knows tragedy may taken place 
got ready every eye board cutter fixed vessel 
doubt getting deeper water every minute 
got within quarter mile ship low evident could float many minutes longer 
boats men cried row lives 
moment later three boats started full speed 
gig dimchurch tom rowing first search sinking ship 
leapt board gave exclamation horror deck strewn dead bodies 
without stopping look ran aft companion went cabin already foot deep water 
found fifteen men women sitting securely bound sofas 
drew dirk running along cut thongs

farther end cabin young girl kneeling side stout old lady evidently fainted

save indeed good dead already save snatching girl ran foot companion 
water already pouring struggled managed reach deck could cross side vessel gave sudden lurch went

moment two unable speak none less ready act 
looking round saw hen coop floating near swimming clung one arm held girl head water 
recovered breath shouted dimchurch fortunately gig far away hail answered moment later boat alongside hen coop

dead sensible ship went water minute 
girl laid helped 
save asked 
yes sir least think 
came running deck jumped straight boats 
busy helping notice missing 
last seemed come called boats make saw could float minute longer got clear went 
indeed narrow escape men row 
standing look discovered boats heard call 
gave bad turn may guess sir glad saw holding hen coop 
let us try bring young lady round said 
turned first upon face let water run mouth 
laid flat back jersey head rubbed hands feet pressed gently times chest 
five minutes treatment girl heaved sigh shortly afterwards opened eyes looked round bewilderment faces men 
suddenly realized remembered happened

poor miss morrison lost name lady kneeling regret say 
impossible save though tried best could lift 
call miss morrison presume close relation 
governess since child mother 
oh think dead saved must remember might worse said certainly require governess many years find others bestow affection 
old fourteen girl said 
well ship best make comfortable 
ship girl said surprise mean say command look boy

chapter viii splendid haul got board boats hoisted davits conducted ladies cabin handed 
ordered cook prepare hot soup girl rescued came deck questioned male passengers 
dressing dinner one said heard shouting deck 
almost immediately great bump knocked us feet thought run directly afterwards heard great tumult going us guessed ship attacked pirates 
clashing swords falling bodies went two three minutes loud savage yell told us pirates taken ship 
next moment ruffians rushed upon us took away valuables persons tied us threw us sofas 
scouring cabins left us noise followed guessed removed hatches getting cargo 
continued night time morning heard brutes going boats thanked god spared lives 
presently became still time saw water rising floor dreadful thought struck us scuttled ship left us perish

hope day avenge murder captain crew 
ship looks good deal larger 
yes said take much account size 
captured two pirates one fight bigger 
ship looks small thing comparison vessel yes ship could pretty well take carry 
weight go much fighting 
really commander honor 
midshipman got command l agile board majesty ships furious hawke 
great deal luck several fights came result entrusted admiral command vessel 
say small guns heavy size match carried pirates 
well sir name fellow passengers offer sincerest thanks manner saved lives 
close shave shown fact unable get ship time carried 
way business laughed 
pirates saw state vessel reluctantly gave chase order see could assistance 
expect schooner run away us full cargo got ship

learned passengers daughter one richest merchants jamaica 
death mother five years old sent home england charge governess drowned northumberland catastrophe occurred way rejoin father 
although saddened death old friend soon showed signs disposition naturally bright cheerful 
bantered command professed regard l agile toy ship expressing great wonder manned boy ab well boy officers 
must surely seem ridiculous said giving orders men old enough father 
quite understand seems said sometimes custom everything suppose men give matter thought 
rate ready follow oldest veteran service 
carried sail could set anxious get craft free passengers search schooner escaped 
loaded thanks passengers landed seeing went made report admiral 
mr gilmore admiral said entered cabin prizes time people saw landing handed report usual admiral insisted hearing details 
uniform looks shrunk mr gilmore said finished 
said nothing water obliged relate rescued girl cabin 
well done young sir deed proud capturing two pirates 
well done indeed suppose want yes sir like sail soon possible first place anxious fall schooner bring captain crew hanged 
laudable ambition 
second place want get lot people come thank saving relatives sir 
get away may hope come back whole thing forgotten 
oughtn acted wisely gallantly 
well sir want lot thanks duty 
good mr gilmore understand feelings quite expect return go ordeal presented piece plate probably attend complimentary ball 
go back ship 
letter chief store department instructing furnish stores may want without waiting signature 
thank much sir hope return shall bring pirate tow 
three months present time certainly hope able make good use 
returning ship made list stores required sent harman shore telling take two boats bring everything back 
five clock afternoon two boats returned carrying stores required 
water tanks already filled quarter hour later cutter sail leaving harbor 
course nothing whatever guide search schooner beyond fact heading west time last saw 
time south porto rico concluded making cuba 
every day therefore cruised along coast island sometimes sending boats ashore examine inlets times running right sea hope pirate whose spies doubt watching movements might suppose given search sailing away 
nevertheless could certain would endeavor avoid catch sight glass pirate captain could made number guns l agile carried would doubtless feel confident superiority would able discover weight guns 
felt pirate fight best policy would first make pretence running hope long chase might manage knock away schooner spars 
one day saw boats gone deep inlet coming back full speed 
saw schooner harman reported think one search 
sighted getting sail 
suit 
run sea make believe afraid 
scarcely boats got board cutter head turned offshore schooner seen issuing inlet 
ordered every sail crowded satisfaction seeing schooner following example 
set whole crew shift long tom bow stern 
muzzle high enough project taffrail order hide better hammocks material piled side form breastwork three feet high 
think said put protection shot bow chasers 
watching schooner quarter hour said think gains upon us lower sail bow deaden way 
small topsail want check half knot hour 
hour schooner yawed fired bow guns 
good said dimchurch shows carry long tom 
thought might hidden done 
answer yet want fire till get within half mile shall hot like 
schooner continued gain slowly occasionally firing bow chasers 
come within mile l agile cutter yawed two broadside guns fired purposely aimed somewhat wide anxious pirates suspect weight metal wish inflicting small injury deter continuing chase 
schooner evidently depended upon vastly superior strength crew carry cutter boarding abstained attempting injure less damage suffered better value would prize 
half mile think sir dimchurch said last 
well let 
gun already loaded dimchurch took steady aim applied match 
leapt upon bulwarks see effect shot cheer broke crew struck schooner bow four feet water 
return schooner yawed bring whole broadside bear cutter six tongues flame flashed side 
moment l agile swung round fired two starboard guns 
ships immediately resumed former positions dimchurch fired shot scattering shower splinters almost spot struck 
must elevate gun little dimchurch said bring mast ears 
get sail board shouted want schooner get nearer 
order executed difference speed cutter manifest 
dimchurch fired 
several shot went schooner foresail yet masts untouched 
little right dimchurch 
time sailor longer usual taking aim fired schooner foremast seen topple head flew wind thus presenting stern cutter 
lame duck said may well take mainmast 
fire away take good aim last time 
ten shots fired last pirate mainmast went side 
well done dimchurch mercy 
sail backwards forwards stern rake grape 
want injure necessary want kill many crew possible better die way taken jamaica hanged 
hour cutter kept work crossing recrossing antagonist stern time poured volley two broadside guns long tom 
stern schooner knocked almost pieces grape shot carried death along decks 
afraid blow said probably done already captain officers killed would require desperado undertake job 
last black flag hoisted spar stern lowered 
saw crew l agile stopped firing sent cheer cheer 
must careful sir dimchurch said scoundrels quite capable pretending surrender board blowing ship us air 
right dimchurch 
might well must know well enough expect mercy 
bringing cutter within hundred yards schooner shouted boat swim receiving reply negative shouted back well drop one 
placed cutter exactly windward schooner lowering one boats rope attached let drift prize 
shouted fasten hawser boat largest 
evidently discussion among men gathered deck pirate seeing hesitated shouted ordered open fire 
decided pirates short time end hawser tied one thwarts boat 
boat hauled back l agile cable got board knotted strongest hawser 
keep good bit astern said otherwise wind drop night might haul vessel us carry plan blowing us 
wise take every precaution sir harman said think trick sort would likely succeed 
may sure keep sharp watch 
hawsers spliced shouted pirates cut away wreckage ship done started prize tow 
soon fairly weigh hailed prisoners speaking trumpet questioned casualties 
replied beginning engagement one hundred twenty men board 
captain killed first volley grape slaughter among crew terrible officers killed eighty men 
remainder run hold remained consultation one crawled deck hoisted lowered black flag 
suppose said intention blow ship us air soon came board 
mean one shouted savagely could paid would minded became 
well indeed dimchurch suggested possibility us 
certainly lost nearly number knowing many crew survived could ventured go board without pretty nearly every man 
lesson future fighting pirates act wild beasts 
well sir know altogether blamed human nature pay back blow blow savages like especially know bound hanged could hardly expect anything else 
suppose dimchurch certainly would rather blown hanged 
suppose reason blow ship found plan failed clung life even days 
expect sir besides know man may think although doubt rest hanged may get 
yes dare say something agreed 
think likely however one spared affair northumberland probably one dozen ships destroyed way 
harman put head round sail back 
sail back sir certainly think doubt inlet pirates head quarters certain storehouses choke full plunder 
associates case shore looking ship return divide valuable portion stores among set fire rest 
done extremely well far another big haul make matters pleasanter 
prize asked harman 
cast eight ten miles shore boats schooner mere log water 
see plunder collected shall able decide act 
cutter hold great deal find carry must load schooner also 
would pirates case sir try make come batches iron would inclined tow schooner within half mile shore give could swim chance getting away 
unable would probably manage get spars hatchways 
richly punished already fancy admiral would much better pleased see schooner come loaded valuable plunder carried forty scoundrels handed hangman 
let escape take great care shore rifling storehouse 
may sure harman 
fellows could certainly take firearms shore keep ten men loaded muskets always guard work would firearms handy 
towed schooner within seven eight miles shore cast made creek pirates come 
entered inlet two miles long could see signs houses sailed far could anchored 
landed party ten well armed men began make careful examination beach 
short time found well beaten path going wood 
following however took precaution fifteen men sent ashore course impossible say many guard left head quarters 
second party landed advanced cautiously path holding muskets readiness instant action 
met however opposition pirates evidently unaware presence 
gone short distance came large clearing middle saw several large huts three great storehouses 
went double towards gone short distance heard shout shot saw dozen men number women issue backs huts make wood 
lads shouted break open doors storehouses likely much value huts 
better take four men dimchurch set fire course look see anything worth taking apply light 
superintended breaking open storehouses 
entered first paused amazement filled top boxes bales 
two similar condition 
enough fill cutter prize dozen times said 
expect trade extent spaniards evidently another intention storing goods 
probably proposed amassed sufficient charter large ship fill hatchways sail american port place questions usually asked 
safe corner one storehouses blew open examined contents found consisted papers manifests cargoes fewer eleven ships 
conjecture right said 
intended doubt keep large merchantman captured fill contents prizes papers manifests cargo could go almost anywhere dispose ill gotten goods 
doubt sir dimchurch said wonder set 
quite possible done already said may taken prizes quicker could dispose would account immense accumulation 
dimchurch sit go bills lading pick valuable goods 
take begin leave admiral send man war charter merchantman bring rest 
schooner carry two three hundred tons could manage cram eighty hundred hold 
get safely jamaica need grieve much find rest goods burned ships come fetch 
took three hours go bills lading making mark valuable goods 
men set sort 
great difficulty goods neatly stored belonging ship separated narrow passages rest 
remainder men except two meanwhile brought cutter 
sentries placed watch approaches storehouses ten men got bales boxes remaining twenty six carried path 
night half men remained storehouses half returning cutter 
sunset went small escort top neighbouring hill see well hulk schooner 
aid telescope could see plainly great satisfaction noted made little drift 
next morning work resumed carried day short breaks meals following two days 
end time much put board cutter could carry 
ten men left guard stores rest going board sailed schooner towed 
first intended stop mile outside inlet came right anchored opposite path labor continually loading cutter transferring cargo hulk would great 
next morning party twelve men went board found expected entirely deserted 
happy made escape anything next day two said go working usual 
fortunately fellows left huts taken completely surprise bolted left guns behind 
therefore joined friends schooner attack us firearms hulk anchored two hundred yards shore would require marvellously good swimmer carry musket ammunition ashore 
future however leave twenty men guard storehouses night boat inlet means could attack cutter likely try swimming 
rate harman place command shall therefore feel perfectly confident shall taken surprise 
trust sir promise sleep one eye open though think would likely attempt enterprise 
much likely attack stores 
think would advisable take twenty five men leave fifteen would ample 
divide two watches would always seven deck 
jefferson uncommonly sharp fellow would charge one watches williams night would chance caught napping 
agreed arrangement 
prize brought close inshore water deep enough allow 
great advantage goods could put board direct work thereby greatly accelerated 
behind pile goods another safe discovered found contain money nearly hundred watches large amount ladies jewellery 
many watches also found huts burned 
bales boxes contained chiefly spices silks sateens shawls piece goods coffee 
night fourth day escape prisoners one sentries perceived dark mass moving wood 
fired musket minute dimchurch five twenty men readiness 
men said fellows attempt rush us 
divide three parties fire volleys one party must fire till see loaded 
way shall always sixteen muskets ready 
fear result even close us cutlasses match knives 
come get ready first section fire till tell 
enemy fully sixty strong came fierce cries knowing garrison guard although could see shadow storehouses 
got within fifty yards gave order fire first eight muskets flashed 
second eight fired almost immediately third eight waiting till first section reloaded followed suit 
nearly every shot told shock great caused advancing enemy hesitate moment 
gave second third sections time reload pirates advanced three deadly volleys poured quick succession 
effect instantaneous 
fully five thirty brought ground six volleys remainder halted swayed moment turned fled full speed pursued however reached wood another general discharge 
well pleased tremendously heavy punishment inflicted 
sixty men attacked us said harman next morning calculate forty belonged schooner 
suppose worse twenty seen crimes committed 
accounted forty escaped schooner probably five six twenty killed 
thrashing likely make another attempt 
right 
work went undisturbed end fortnight schooner laden 
hatches closed made water tight full deck two feet half water although guns thrown overboard landed 
think ready sail harman said 
ready sail fortnight hard work us said 
suppose going leave hogsheads sugar puncheons rum bales goods burnt destroyed scoundrels 
prevent easily 
plenty materials spot form four batteries one side storehouses 
drag eight schooner guns mount two battery shall loaded crammed muzzle grape shot 
batteries shall built clear storehouses echelon one attacked supported others 
garrison leave sixteen men dimchurch 
dimchurch called matter explained readily agreed take charge 
two men said watch battery others sleep chance taken surprise may quite sure matter strong mob may come stand discharge eight cannon loaded say 
suppose sir mean form batteries bales cotton 
whole ship load 
intention dimchurch mind time 
whole strength crew exception two watch board cutter went storehouses men delighted know booty lost set work great vigor 
marked sites batteries bales cotton rolled built substantial walls 
took ten days hard labor haul guns 
work completed dimchurch chose sixteen crew 
ample supply provisions taken huts burnt necessary draw upon stores cutter 
ready two parties said good bye mutual cheer cutter crew went board 
hazardous business admit said got sail moved inlet schooner tow 
course shall little uneasy return jamaica relieve dimchurch feel convinced able hold give another lesson pirates necessary 
see us sail naturally conclude great number left guard stores 
still may sure kept watch doings edge forest sight guns inspire wholesome dread 
think eight discharges grape langrage send right however strong may 
besides given men three muskets addition found board schooner enemy press able give warm reception 
even attack much still resource left exit rear battery retire storehouses 
instructed carry muskets back sixteen men four muskets apiece could make sturdy defense 
know doors repaired strengthened loopholes cut walls 
still think needed 
much think prize worth harman asked 
really idea sure got schooner must worth thousands pounds 
left behind must contents ten vessels able take full cargo one good sized ship 
chapter ix spell ashore ten days later arrived jamaica went make report admiral 
well admiral said heartily brought another prize mr gilmore 
looks mere hulk remarkably deep water 
schooner sank northumberland 
must knocked terribly evidently sinking 
sir right except stern shattered 
covered tarpaulins backed battens otherwise almost uninjured 
glad indeed hear caught scoundrel mr gilmore hardly think worth towing 
worth good deal sir cutter choke full loot 
indeed admiral said tone gratification 
case must valuable let hear 
stated report sir 
always leave good deal report 
please give full account 
first many guns carry six guns side sir 
must done wonders 
tell 
modestly gave full account fight steps afterwards taken prevent playing treacherous trick upon land fight arrangements made secure goods found head quarters 
brought home time admiral asked 
list sir 
took bills lading found pirate head quarters 
altogether storehouses contained cargoes eleven ships 
picked valuable goods loaded cutter schooner small portion total 
left nearly half crew guard storehouses could send ships bring home contents 
cutter navigate schooner tow dared weaken 
left sixteen men boatswain erected four batteries cotton bales mounting two guns charged muzzle grape langrage 
every confidence therefore little garrison able hold greatly superior force 
great risk admiral said gravely 
aware sir worth running risk splendid prize 
value nearly eleven cargoes must something great 
indeed must admiral said composed see entire list bills lading sir 
say nearly half goods sugar rum molasses half bales boxes details given 
brought home silks satins cloth shawls materials female dress coffee spices 
well mr gilmore certainly appears richest haul ever made islands rate since days spanish galleons 
lose time chartering ships 
many think necessary say sir five vessels could two trips 
meanwhile wish would give another thirty men strengthen garrison 
certainly 
several vessels harbor discharged cargoes yet taken fresh ones board waiting sail england convoy 
doubt glad job meantime 
four days later cutter put sea five merchantmen frigate charged act convoy 
arrived inlet went ashore delight found storehouses intact little garrison well 
crews ships landed short time place scene bustle activity 
spite however exertions fortnight ships loaded 
setting sail told thirty additional men remain harman left command 
dimchurch reported pirates shown force 
allowed come within hundred yards battery facing poured contents guns whereupon fled leaving ten killed behind 
little fleet arrived jamaica found goods brought cutter schooner valued far higher price estimate 
merchantmen unloaded fast possible started cuba without delay 
well garrison inlet 
serious attack made forts day fleet sailed jamaica garrison repulsed effectually seen sign enemy since 
even hope plunder strong enough induce negroes make another attempt pirates almost entirely wiped 
storehouses emptied burned harman party returned cutter fleet sailed jamaica 
immediately started short cruise 
time met adventures 
end three weeks returned went make report admiral told total value capture amounted 
must congratulate said well haul 
say would make richest midshipman service 
share know eighth 
officer command altogether independent fleet get one quarter 
mr harman share eighth rest divided among crew boatswain getting four shares 
astounded sir said seems almost impossible master much money 
satisfaction rate mr gilmore knowing earned exertions courage skill 
think fair send back ship next comes give someone else chance 
agree sir feel deeply indebted put way making fortune 
little knew coming admiral said gave command little craft 
slightest notion assuredly given older officer 
returned cutter state bewilderment good fortune 
came deck little later found waiting gentleman advanced open arms 
mr gilmore said name palethorpe 
father young girl whose life gallantly saved northumberland sank 
trying catch ever since live among hills except business calls stay always short never heard arrival started 
say sir intensely grateful feel 
child may guess terrible blow would lost 
duty sir glad indeed able save daughter life

bound carried away exulting negroes 
illustration tom dimchurch made desperate defence bad job said came senses 
mighty bad job master 
niggers think suppose escaped slaves certainly many mountains cuba 
suppose saw us sailing came hills hope capturing us 
likely enough take us pirates constant scourge capturing little fishing boats either cutting throats forcing serve 
afraid shall little opportunity explaining matters course speak english none us understand word spanish 
carried hill thrown small clearing summit 
vain endeavored address english received attention whatever 
think going us sir dimchurch asked 
well say likely going burn us alive put us death devilish way 
well sir think niggers know much tying ropes 
seems could get free without much trouble

matter sir 
shift mine got jack knife pocket make short work ropes tom well try dimchurch 
half fellows away wood sounds hear cutting brushwood time lose 
five minutes remark made dimchurch said free 
immediately afterwards felt bonds fall half minute later exclamation thankfulness tom showed liberated 
must crawl towards edge forest said instead going straight hill turn short distance 
sure miss us immediately believe made direct sea 
barely got shelter forest heard sudden shout turned aside hid brushwood 
minute two later satisfaction hearing negroes rushing body hill 
waited pursuers covered hundred yards jumped feet held way along hillside nearly quarter mile began descend 
changed course heard outburst musketry fire 
hooray dimchurch exclaimed fellows coming hill search us 
right give hot guess go back quick came

yes like 
room bow two extra muskets may useful 
two men standing close took places heard permission given 
certainly like appearance gilmore lieutenant said 
help thinking algerine rig though every algerine necessarily pirate large number 
fancy breeze spring soon case may long row overtake 
breeze came presently algerine began slip away 
however puff boat began gain 
five miles ship within quarter mile chase 
confound fellow lieutenant muttered think mistaken half dozen men deck 
length boat swept side craft 
men leapt feet couple round shot thrown boat one going bottom 
cutter immediately began fill men climbed confronted fully hundred armed moors 
lieutenant saxton cut sailors suffered fate 
usual dimchurch stevens held together fought back back 
contest however uneven last moorish captain came signed must lay arms 
said 
evidently prefer take us prisoners killing us could without difficulty 
caught regular trap must make best 
saying threw cutlass others followed example 
taken three unwounded sailors wounded dead thrown overboard 
worst affair together said dimchurch since fell hands negroes 
unless tartar overtakes us afraid bad time 
afraid dimchurch fear little chance indeed frigate overtaking us 
light wind craft would run away fully five miles start would useless boats try overtake 
going us little doubt 
make slaves us either set us work fortifications sell us taken country 
expect keep us long dimchurch said grimly 
know great numbers christians hold captive rare indeed one escapes 
suppose day send fleet root hands far full anything sort present 
chance escape may sure take better make minds make best things opportunity offers 
hope kept together sir 
could put would awful separated even one saw chance escape could let others know 
may sure dimchurch whatever opportunity might see would avail unless could take 
sir dimchurch said words echoed tom 
six days later heard anchor run presently hatchway lifted told come deck 
found expected craft lying harbor algiers 
time might admired city mosques minarets massive fortifications shipping port humor 
regarded jail 
three sailors put boat rowed ashore captain craft going 
met wharf moor evidently official rank 
captain held animated conversation laughter doubt whatever captain telling clever manner effected capture 
official said something altogether pleasing captain however crossed hands breast bowed submissively 
official handed six prisoners men accompanied immediately marched across large barrack like building evidently prison 
two hours afterwards great troop captives came 
worn wearied asked questions new comers 
talk one said answer question 
one us would kill got chance 
work work work daybreak till sunset 
enough eat keep us alive valuable allowed die 
get food start morning mid day get back 
oh careful us mind suffer sun blazes day drop drink get except meals

sunstroke fever always thinning ranks 
history mate talk till morning could tell 
suppose cut man war man right dimchurch said 
got caught trap nine mates killed without chance fire shot 
ah man said sigh wish luck wish long 
rough food served slaves eating lay without exchanging word anxious sleep away thought misery 
three friends lay together

agreed 
convinced however sharp watch may keep three resolute men find way escape 
know little morrow 
windows building ought able get surrounded walls ought able scale 
besides set work city might find opportunity evading diligence guards 
one thing must assume air cheerfulness work 
time see work well contented obedient watch relax 
must like poor fellows make minds lot hopeless 
lose hope shall lose everything 
rate present must wait patiently 
still got find everything know confined prison shall work day 
got find plan city general bearings learn something surrounding country see manage subsist got away 
course natural idea would make sea steal boat 
came shore archway wall strongly guarded fear would next impossible get port 
best plan think would take country go shore distance city 
might light upon boat belonging fisherman 
course pure conjecture arrange shall keep eyes us look empty house might hide discover might leave town land side likely fortifications nearly strong sea face 
next morning captives deprived clothes place given dirty linen jackets loose trousers 
shoes also taken away 
fell rest captives 
leaving prison formed companies strong guard marched different directions 
three friends kept close together assigned company told clean streets certain quarter town 
furnished brooms brushes soon hard work 
morning went heat became tremendous 
several men fell overseers lashed got upon feet 
eye like working oven dimchurch muttered dust choking 
must certainly get soon sir

feel melting away 
put bit food mouth believe heat would bake time 
swallow anything tom said even mackerel fresh sea 
know agreed must make best everything said 
work please overseers shall save blows 
better strike dimchurch said man would never live strike another 
might said would small satisfaction flogged death afterwards 
suppose sir flesh blood stand thing struck one yellow hounds 
twelve clock gang returned men drank eagerly fountain courtyard prison 
take little said drink much harm 
drink often like provided take sip time 
easy say mr gilmore easy 
feel could drink till burst

abstinence far benefited felt work afternoon less done morning though heat anything greater 
evening examined prison 
consisted one great hall supported rows pillars 
whole prisoners confined 
lighted windows five twenty feet ground 
guard inside fifty men always sentry slept outside hall 
clear therefore escape could made locked get away must make attempt employed outside 
third day one sailors tartar disregarded advice drink sparingly fell dead drinking till could drink

say might luck seize bind three gardeners attendants issue one gates dressed clothes without exciting suspicion 
grub sir well must trust chance 
houses might robbed travellers might lightened belongings 
think three active men though might unarmed would allow starve 
course want get rid clothes find weapons great point discover whether door locked 
right sir ready try anything may suggest sick death work heat food guard everything connected 
looked door longing eyes time passed 
last one day man came gateway passing pulling gate behind walked away without apparently thinking locking 
settles point said 
next important question people moving inside slip away unseen begin manage always walk rear gang 
often rows poor wretch goes mad attacks guard generally rush others assistance 
thing happen near gate might manage slip unnoticed 
still admit chances anything sort taking place point expect must try think something better

want one thing make us perfect said pipe bacca 
well would welcome addition tom admitted expect much 
surprised light upon tobacco plants one gardens course could hardly like properly dried leaf 
dare say though could make something 
lived month sometimes better sometimes worse sufficient food one sort another 
far knew suspicion presence excited though petty robberies must noticed 
one evening however going top sand hill generally saw large detachment soldiers coming along searching ground carefully 
ran companions 
take weapons lads said make strong party soldiers searching country coming way 
doubt looking us 
run hundred yards heard shouts looking round saw moorish officer waving hands gesticulating 
alarming reckoned fully five hundred yards start 
keep steady pace said expect beggars run faster 
pitch dark half hour fortunately moon expect able give slip 
advanced found vegetation became scarcer scarcer 
afraid edge desert said means fowls fruit us 
see dimchurch thoughtful time 
half sheep cakes valuable us 
going leave soldiers knew sir gone far among last us time care 
changed course several times soon became quite dark presently satisfaction hearing shouts pursuers fade away behind 
take quietly lads 
guide towards sea means stars 
fancy must fully twenty miles away 
must hold till get gradually work way along among sand hills clumps bush bordering till come village 
must contrive get good supply food water steal boat make 
galleys sent search us must given long ago 
craft take chance 
kept steadily north last came coast 
still dark lay till morning 
sun rose thought could make village eight miles away 
quite safe cook breakfast dimchurch said 
yes think answered must sparing mutton food present may little time get hold anything else 
breakfast lay among bushes slept till evening 
started along shore towards village 
got within half mile halted 
could see boats shore felt difficulty way question provisions 
quite dark went village started forage meeting little show 
managed take five fowls village evidently poor place exception melons fruit 
beggars must grain somewhere said 
live fowls melons 
expect sir live largely fish 
likely enough agreed 
let us put fowls melons bush nap couple hours till sure everyone asleep 
go look boats 
come late may probably leave catch board 
went boats found three contained fair quantity fish 
helped retreated distance village picking provisions way going clump bushes cooked portion fish 
pretty well settles question provisions said 
must choose night good wind blowing offshore may run good many miles morning 
must trust falling one cruisers 
fish keep long climate suggested tom 
said dry sun keep good time 
might clean half dozen fowls cook start 
great difficulty water 
yes get stripping gardens clean melons 
weigh four five pounds apiece would supply us fluid week easily 
next evening went made careful examination boats 
one particular attracted attention 
nearly new looked likely faster rest 
anchored fifty yards shore 
three evenings spent prowling village collecting food 
evident villagers alarmed depredations third evening fired several men 
consequence moved mile farther away case search made next night carried provisions shore 
expert swimmers soon alongside chosen craft 
pushed provisions small raft put board made trip one two boats brought away twenty pounds fish 
cut hawser hoisted sail 
heard great tumult shore villagers ran water edge opened fire upon 
shooting however wild soon range 
several boats put pursuit 
caused uneasiness watched somewhat anxiously wind though favourable light felt means certain would able keep ahead rowers 
stolen craft however proved unexpectedly fast boats following fifteen miles without sensibly gaining last gave chase 
time wind great relief became stronger little vessel flew rapidly sea 
fine craft dimchurch said moors certainly know build boats 
would require smart cutter hold us 
dimchurch kept helm two investigated capture 
three parts decked 
cabin came upon lantern flint steel soon light helped greatly work 
bow ropes stored away locker found bread although stale acceptable 
also unearthed two three suits rough sea clothes glad replace light clothes carried away palace grounds though weather shore warm sea breeze chilly 
among useful things also discovered several long knives axes flat stone cooking upon 
question luck said danger greater get bit farther 
vessels going mediterranean give barbary coast wide berth 
course pirate fellows numerous along line traffic found right spanish french italian coasts though late fancy active 
many cruisers taste spaniards get chance show scoundrels mercy 
morning broke sail visible 
think sir dimchurch said going change weather gale 
matter much 
fancy boat would go however severe might 
yes sir would check progress want run north fast 
see line making aiming toulon present pace would take us something like four days get 
caught gale may take two days longer 
agreed hand wind becomes much stronger take sail case chance escaping notice come near moorish craft 
besides sea really rough would difficult board us even come us 
right sir still prefer strong southerly wind clear sky 
well afraid get wish clouds certainly seem banking north get change wind ere long 
night wind blowing fiercely sea rapidly rising 
sails closely reefed even felt pleasure little craft making good way 
wind increased night blowing gale morning 
twelve clock craft seen approaching convinced algerine 
changed course bore upon firing gun signal stop 
rather faster dimchurch said lead good dance gets hold us 
could work guns sea faster least handier 
three hours chase continued 
algerine came time little boat turning almost heel cleverly handled glided away underneath enemy bows 
time saw chase slipping away angry moors sent volley musketry fugitives took refuge cabin lay deck close bulwarks escaped 
soon moors intent chase began take great risks vessel 
fact became positively reckless 
paid heavily 
many disappointments felt fugitives last clutches preparing board suddenly dimchurch put helm sharply 
nearly capsized little craft indeed would rather gone fall hands moors righted immediately skimmed away pursuers 
excitement moment moorish steersman attempted maneuver 
succeeded would probably run cockle shell baffled long 
moment violent squall struck ship full force mainmast snapped feet deck 
three fugitives jumped feet cheered calmly proceeded way 
chapter xii back tartar next morning broke fair 
late foe dropped sight previous evening sun rose tom made top sails large ship horizon 
coming towards us lads course steering pass within three miles us 
english french far away yet certain dimchurch said help thinking french 
rate dimchurch best course lower sail shake reef points ready hoisting moment notice 
wind light fancy could get away start two three miles would chance whatever catching us 
suddenly tom stevens exclaimed sail coming behind 
looks close hauled 
ships come bound meet one french english likely talk 
case able tell friend foe colors could make english ship 
sat anxiously watching two ships soon saw point meeting must near position 
presently hulls became visible dimchurch pronounced one thirty two gun frigate forty forty two 
made one coming south flying white ensign hoisted sail made 
equally intent upon fight two vessels approached without paying slightest attention little craft 
frenchman means fighting ten guns good may well think match ship 
know dimchurch think lysander sir though sure many thirty twos 
vessels passed exchanged broadsides 
tacked englishman quicker raked french frigate came round 
went hammer tongs 
frenchman suffered heavily spars rigging last foremast english ship fell side 
frenchman closed pouring broadside tried board 
little boat bore stern english ship 
desperate conflict going point failing get moved along side 
rope cut french fire hanging overboard grasping climbed port hole 
deck deserted hands rushed meet attack french boarders 
without moment delay snatched cutlasses rack ran companion upper deck 
things going somewhat badly 
french much numerous english forcing back sheer weight numbers 
new comers rushed fray laid lustily 
force suddenness onslaught caused enemy hesitate time effect inspiring fresh efforts english crew lost captain first lieutenant beginning lose heart 
answered cheers strangely clad allies one accord charged meet 
moment dimchurch almost severed french captain head body sweeping blow french disheartened loss leader gave way 
english sailors redoubled efforts ten minutes desperate fighting succeeded driving foes back ship 
men ran guns cannonade recommenced 
spirit two crews changed 
french discouraged failure british exultant success 
consequently guns english ship fired far rapidity precision french 
several port holes french ship knocked one last mainmast hit several times fell side flag run amidst tremendous cheering english ship 
immediately hands engaged disarming securing french prisoners 
sent decks ships cleared dead 
bulk crew set work cut away wreckage secure damaged spars stop holes near water edge

three escaped capturing small craft see lying side ship made open sea 
algerine nearly recaptured us gale yesterday fortunately carried away mast escaped 
morning saw two ships approaching us made nationalities knew bound fight 
naturally made ship found french boarded best aid drive back 
name gilmore 
well mr gilmore thank heartily efficacious aid rendered us

two midshipmen fallen seniors lieutenant said must two three years older others appoint acting lieutenant 
first duty rig jury foremast 
appoint however temporary commander camille see name prize

meanwhile crew lysander hard work got jury foremast position securely stayed 
made good job prize mr gilmore lieutenant said 
course lame duck without mainmast sail together show good face single ship may meet

ship heave sight get guns loaded broadsides 
course able work one side time forty good men could keep pretty hot fire 
give ten mr gilmore 
repairs finished manage easily camille bigger ship lysander ought certainly many spared 
thank sir sure could make good fight number covered shot holes canvas appear injured hull think one ship would think meddling us unless course line battle ship

force command strong enough blockade three forts near blockade one two leave entrance open would useless 
determined first take forneilli fortified place two miles san fiorenzo opened attack found much strongly fortified anticipated capture could effected without loss gain position would justify 
lord hood placed squadron frigates captain nelson command cruise north western coast island prevent supplies introduced also sailed seventy fours body soldiers major general dundas

lord hood arrived ordered nelson land island prevent supplies getting bastia took charge siege san fiorenzo 
way nelson captured town maginaggio routed garrison destroyed great quantity provisions prepared number french vessels harbor 
lord hood commenced siege attacking town mortella 
garrison fought great bravery inflicted heavy loss upon fortitude seventy four guns task battering assigned 
evidently getting worst fortitude withdrawn shore batteries successful place set fire garrison surrendered 
convention redoubt next place attacked 
fortified formidable manner indeed strongly constructed withstand ordinary attack 
short distance away however rock rising seven hundred feet level sea entirely commanded 
enemy left unfortified unguarded believed inaccessible 
many places almost perpendicular though path leading summit places wide enough allow one person ascend time 
admiral hood person reconnoitred decided battery could formed summit 
next day shore command party thirty men start getting guns

work took two days tremendous labor seamen relieved three times day 
constantly spot directing superintending operations satisfaction last seeing six guns placed summit rock 
next morning besieged astonished guns opened fire upon rock path back seen going 
could obtain shelter attack possibility silencing guns hastily abandoned post retreated san fiorenzo 
battery rock however also commanded town accordingly abandoned following day garrison retiring adjoining ridge ground bastia considered strongest place island

nelson immensely pleased manner operation getting guns rock performed requested captain tartar permanently stationed shore act aide de camp request course complied 
meantime nelson reconnoitred bastia neighbouring coast recommended troops cannon disembarked convinced land force thousand co operation ships would sufficient reduce place 
unfortunately general commanding troops one irresolute men days resigned command consequence differences lord hood successor general aubant still incapable 
pronounced though force command almost double nelson asked insufficient work required 
nelson burning indignation decided attempt take bastia must made army would navy must 
lord hood agreed even decided undertake siege aubant insisted without single soldier single cannon retiring san fiorenzo kept men inactive sailors performing work
