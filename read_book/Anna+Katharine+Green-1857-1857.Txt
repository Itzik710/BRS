miss scott 
let come eyes sought mr challoner quietly nodded 
immediately stepped door figure guarded motioning enter begged mr challoner imploring look sustain interview saw 
desire encounter especially mr brotherson glance direction anything conciliatory 
quite convinced nothing gained could resist appeal followed little room whose limited dimensions made tall orlando look bigger stronger lordly self confidence ever 
sorry late began contemplating intrusive figure forced composure 
quiet evenings disturb brother first sleep great importance 
see night pray wait 
sick man 
dangerously yes 
orlando continued regard peculiar awakening gaze showing mr challoner thought interest brother spoke mechanically sole obedience proprieties occasion 
know ill till lately 
last letter cheerful one supposed right till chance revealed truth 
came 
intending come anyway 
business probably know miss scott 
shook head 
know little business said 
brother told expected even told expected 
word highly expressive surprise touch wonder satisfaction 
oswald always close mouthed declared 
good fault obliged boy 
last words uttered lightness imposed upon two highly agitated hearers causing mr challoner frown doris shrink back indignation man could indulge sportive suggestion presence fears memories situation evoked 
one knew strong self contained man sweetwater possibly present attempt quiet manner strange fitful flash ordinarily quick eye showed laboring laboring almost first entrance excitement thought feeling one powerfully organised nature must end soon outburst mysterious passion would carry everything 
mean happen 
accustomed self command forget presence 
would hold rampant dogs leash till hour solitude glittering smile twisted lips continued gaze first girl entered life man every reason distrust firm restraint upon still full force remarked courteous inclination hour late conversation 
room hotel return 
morning hope see brother 
going doris knowing say mr challoner desirous detaining came sound little tinkle side hall blanching young girl cheeks causing orlando brotherson brows rise peculiar satisfaction 
brother asked 
yes came faltering reply 
heard voices must go 
say orlando wishes good night smiled heart enemy bow infinite grace 
shuddered hastening room glance fell mr challoner 
pale looked greatly disturbed 
prospect left alone man denounced daughter murderer might prove tax strength right subject 
pausing appealing air made slight gesture understood 
accompany hall said 
anything wrong speak name 
orlando brotherson displeased move took step brought two 
hear chooses speak 
point settled us either us leaves house opportunity good another 
go brother miss scott await return 
flash proud banker eye demur rather gesture consent 
doris look deep anxiety sped away two men stood face face 
one moments men recognize memorable 
one say hear worthy preamble doubtful relation stood mr challoner time expected wonder gird whatever suffering shock awaited 
orlando brotherson unlike usual self kept waiting collected wits strange say seemed vanished girl 
question finally came 
mr challoner know brother never seen 
know know 
strangers 
said honestly 
know 
mr challoner quite correct statement 
doubts 
coincidence finding mourner avenger edith challoner direct radius spot distant obscure disconnected apparent business reason certainly startling enough unless tie could found brother name close relationship 
therefore allowed press question men sometimes correspond know 
knew brotherson lived yes 
hoped learn something interest solely brother 
brother oswald interest apart oswald suddenly thought name unimaginable one one power blanch even hardy cheek shake soul unassailable small emotions 
oswald brotherson repeated adding unintelligible tones b initials following initials 
poor oswald 
aloud hardly becomes perhaps question motives attempt making brother acquaintance 
think guess labor wasted 
oswald interests extend beyond town hardly extend 
strangers almost 
learn nothing subject naturally engrosses 
mr challoner simply bowed 
feel called upon said explain reasons wishing know brother 
simply satisfy upon point may well rouse curiosity 
remember daughter last act writing letter little protegee 
miss scott protegee 
seeking came upon 
require say subject wait till seen mr oswald brotherson perhaps 
receiving answer mr challoner turned man object deepest suspicions find still daze unimaginable thought battling scoffing succumbing without word 
mr challoner without clew struggle might mystery drove extreme agitation room 
though proof lacking though proof might never come nothing could ever alter belief moment doris right estimate man guilt however unsubstantial reasoning might appear 
far might carried new conviction whether would left house without seeing doris exchanging another word man whose presence stifled opportunity show taken another step encountered hurrying figure doris returning guests air marked relief 
know whispered mr challoner passed
