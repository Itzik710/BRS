need hardly explained mrs mountjoy information respecting scene london come augustus scarborough 
told annesley last london see brother mountjoy described nature scene occurred doubt forgotten subsequently seen brother 
story told need mention necessity character making tragedy night 
doubt according idea two alone together 
harry struck blow brother injured left street
