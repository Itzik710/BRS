let us go ahead boldly 
clarisse always recovered confidence lupin presence 
future seemed less appalling admitted forced admit chances saving gilbert lessened hideous death sentence 
could prevail upon return brittany

next day inquiries police confirmed prasville lupin already knew 
marquis albufex deeply involved business canal deeply prince napoleon obliged remove management political campaign france kept extravagant style living dint constant loans makeshifts 
hand far concerned kidnapping daubrecq ascertained contrary usual custom marquis appeared club six seven evening dined home 
come back midnight came foot 
nicole accusation therefore receiving early proof 
unfortunately lupin successful attempts impossible obtain least clue motor car chauffeur four people entered daubrecq house 
associates marquis compromised canal affair like men pay nobody knew 
whole search consequently concentrated upon marquis country seats houses might possess certain distance paris distance allowing average speed motor car inevitable stoppages could put sixty ninety miles 
albufex sold everything ever possessed neither country houses landed estates 
turned attention marquis relations intimate friends 
able side dispose safe retreat imprison daubrecq result equally fruitless

said lupin racked anxiety fifty five days fifty days one days oh beg beg could indeed lupin would leave task watching marquis one practically lived without sleeping 
marquis resumed regular life doubtless suspecting something risk going away 
alone went duc de montmaur daytime 
duke kept pack boar hounds hunted forest durlaine 
albufex maintained relations outside hunt 
hardly likely said prasville duc de montmaur exceedingly wealthy man interested estates hunting takes part politics lend illegal detention daubrecq deputy chateau
