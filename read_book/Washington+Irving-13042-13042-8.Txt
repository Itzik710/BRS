fact time two nations said state perfect amity negotiation open treaty pending 
stipulations entered bonds restrain specific limits awaken captious jealousy right implanted nature party advantage hope expect two nations wonderfully gracious friendly ministers professing highest mutual regard exchanging billets doux making fine speeches indulging little diplomatic flirtations coquetries fondlings marvelously tickle good humor respective nations 
thus may paradoxically said never good understanding two nations little misunderstanding long terms best terms world means pretend claim merit made discovery 
fact long secretly acted upon certain enlightened cabinets together divers notable theories privately copied commonplace book illustrious gentleman member congress enjoyed unlimited confidence heads departments
