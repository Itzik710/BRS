lad standing little lookout turret top border fortalice 
place evidently built solely eye defense comfort altogether secondary consideration 
square building rough stone walls broken narrow loopholes door ten feet ground reached broad wooden steps could hauled case necessity fact raised every night 
building forty feet square 
upper floor divided several chambers sleeping places lord master family women household 
floor onto door without opened undivided save two rows stone pillars supported beams floor

roof house flat paved square blocks stone parapet three feet high surrounded 
center lookout tower rising twelve feet door another turret projecting eighteen inches beyond wall house slits cut stone floor missiles could dropped boiling lead poured upon trying assault entrance 
outside courtyard extending round house 
ten yards across surrounded wall twelve feet high square turret corner 
everything roughly constructed although massive solid 
exception door steps leading wood used construction 
beams rough stone floors material 
clearly object builders erect fortress could defy fire could destroyed cost enormous labor 
indeed prime necessity hold stood wild country upper waters coquet reed river 
harbottle longpikes rose miles away whole country broken deep ravines valleys fells crags 
edge moorland hundred yards outer wall ground dropped sharply valley two villages yardhope lay little burn running coquet 
directions moor extended distance nearly mile 
two three score cattle dozen shaggy little horses engaged effort keep life together upon rough herbage grew among heather blocks stones scattered everywhere 
presently lad caught sight flash sun risen behind spearhead western edge moor 
ran post principal room 
coming mother exclaimed 
seen sun glint spearhead 
trust said turned two women fire bade put wood get pots boiling 
go oswald soon make father figure bring news 
closed eye last two nights tis dangerous enterprise usual gone 
father always comes home right mother boy said confidently strong band time 
joined thomas gray following forster currick john liddel percy hope bilderton 
must full sixty spears 
bairds like pay heavily last raid hither 
dame forster reply oswald ran lookout 
time party watching reached moor 
consisted twelve fourteen horsemen clad dark armor carrying long spears mounted small wiry horses 
driving knot forty fifty cattle three led horses carrying heavy burdens 
oswald quick eye noticed four horsemen carrying spears 
three short number said four must sorely wounded 
well might worse 
oswald brought regard forays attacks ordinary incidents life 
watch ward always kept little fortalice especially nights dark misty never saying party scottish borderers might make attack truces often concluded border wardens slight effect prickers small chieftains sides called maintained constant state warfare 
scotch forays frequent english side border people warlike poorer depended entirely upon plunder subsistence 
little difference race peoples opposite side border 
largely mixed danish anglo saxon blood william conqueror carried fire sword northumbria great numbers inhabitants moved north settled district beyond reach norman arms 
english side border population time leavened norman blood estates granted william barons 
often married heiresses dispossessed families followers found wives among native population 
frequent wars scots every man capable bearing arms northern counties take part incessant border warfare maintained martial spirit among population considered retaliation injuries received natural lawful act 
extent heightened fact terms many truces specifically permitted suffered losses either side pursue plunderers across border 
raids accompanied bloodshed except resistance made people descended common stock active animosity ordinary times free friendly intercourse 
however many exceptions rule unresisting persons injured 
many families opposite sides border existed blood feuds arising fact members one killed forays cases bitter bloody reprisals made either side 
border line ill defined people one side frequently settled shown fact several treaties contained provisions moved might change nationality accounted scotch englishmen case might 
forsters bairds feud existed three generations 
begun raid latter 
forster time repulsed attack hand killed one bairds 
six months later surprised killed hearthstone time son retainers away raid 
time animosity two families unceasing several lives lost sides 
bairds large party three months carried fire sword district bordering main road far elsdon east alwinton north 
news coming however preceded 
villagers yardhope time take refuge forster hold repulsed determined attacks made upon sir robert umfraville brought strong party assistance drove bairds back towards frontier 
present raid party returning organized partly recoup took part loss cattle occasion partly take vengeance upon bairds 
custom sides border expeditions generally composed members half dozen families followers one energetic best acquainted intricacies country paths across fells moors chosen leader 
presently oswald forster saw one party wave hand order four five horsemen rode began drive scattered cattle horses towards house 
oswald ran 
father right mother 
given orders men driving animals suppose bairds must pursuit 
better tell men get armor 
without waiting answer told six men eating breakfast farther end room make end meal get steel caps breast back pieces take places turret gate yard 
minutes animals began pour first homestead captured herd weary exhausted long hurried journey came master followers 
mary forster son stood top steps ready greet 
gate yard opposite side doorway fortalice order assailants carried pass round fire archers turrets could attack building 
gave little cry husband came 
left arm sling helmet cleft bandage showed beneath 
afraid wife said cheerily 
hotter work expected far concerned great harm done 
sorry say lost long hal rob finch smedley 
two three others sorely wounded fancy got altogether scatheless 
went well stopped wait daybreak three miles allan baird place 
shepherd must got sight us halted found men ready 
time however drive cattle seeing like enough bairds swarming upon us could take allan place contented gathering cattle driving 
two hundred 
went fast two hours saw bairds coming pursuit clear would overtake us hampered cattle stood made defense 
much difference numbers bairds time gather strength 
fight stiff one 
side percy hope killed john liddel sorely wounded hope life 
sixteen men killed outright us less scarred 
side allan baird killed john smitten sorely wounded say certain put horse took away 
left twenty behind ground dead rest finding better men rode 
william baird come 
hold far news reached knew well enough doubtless came following hours beaten kinsmen 
ridden fast overtake us 
struck north soon crossed border traveled night paths find difficult follow track us especially broke four parties chose way 
driven cattle case make straight losing track 
course many fought us know us well even bairds despoiled would hardly follow us far across border fetch cattle 
bairds notorious scottish raiders claim right following would beyond bearing 
believe head cattle among whole herd born bred side border 
fetching back stolen goods 
time men entered house gone fray scatheless assisted women removing armor wounded comrades 
forced relinquish spears first attended 
thought sending leech 
every man woman within fifty miles border accustomed treatment wounds every hold store bandages styptics unguents ready instant use 
men sorely wounded less hardy frame less inured hardships could supported long ride 
john forster taking armor saw wounds first attended wife women 
think said live strike another blow bairds yet 
oswald unbuckle harness 
mother bandage arm head elspeth shall bring full tankard us 
draught beer much good salves medicaments 
take first drink jock samlen go watchtower 
see men posted wall turrets 
one shall relieve shortly 
soon wounds dressed bowls porridge served round one men remained home posted lookout cattle seen road stretched rushes one end room minutes sound asleep 
wonder whether shall ever peace land oswald mother said sigh seen women readiness preparation midday meal sat low stool side 
see ever mother either conquer scotland scotch shall masters 
fault 
ever raiding plundering heed orders douglas lords marches 
almost bad oswald 
nay mother try take back father well said cattle brought english taken us bairds pay back coin 
makes little difference whether war peace 
reiving caterans ever move 
last week adam gordon bands wasted tynedale far bellingham carried say two thousand head cattle slew many people 
cross border sometimes give lesson would become bold would limit raids 
true enough oswald hard always require watch one within forty miles border time go sleep surety ere morning hear raiders knocking gate 
methinks would dull nought look cattle oswald replied 
seemed bred amid constant forays excitements state things normal one natural man need spear ever ready hand give take hard blows 
besides went though carry others cattle fetch home bad friends truces hold save case blood feuds 
last week allan armstrong two sisters staying us promised ere long would ride across border spend week 
yes makes worse 
adam armstrong married sister elizabeth first met goddington fair indeed families either side border english scotch blood veins 
natural friends seeing often held berwick roxburgh dumfries often times peace scotchmen come across border trade fairs 
speak tongue save border line one people though indeed different kirkcudbright wigtown galwegians tongue scarce understood border scots 
tis strange one side border keep peace towards 
save kingdoms war mother keep peace except matter cattle lifting bear enmity towards save blood shed 
wartime must course fight nation lord orders 
wasted scotland end end swept northern counties well nigh often 
heard father say eight times last hundred years hold levelled ground 
escaped last time built strongly stone could fire would taken almost long pick pieces took build 
yes infant oswald 
heard scotch army marching way took refuge cattle horses among pikes first carried burnt forage stores leaving nothing could set fire 
father often laughed thought angry must found mischief could short long stay never make way could damage 
house escaped scot free thirty miles round 
indeed tis generally parties pillagers trouble part country even invade england 
richer booty far gathered cumberland durham nought cattle horses many side border 
plunder towns chiefly attracts go past empty handed always carry great trains booty backward way 
still would dull work fighting mother 
fighting southern england oswald save go across sea fight french yet suppose find life less dull 

little tillage country poor would care break land raise crops night ricks might flames granaries plundered thus nought us keep cattle need little care attention driven fells scots make great raid 
south heard always much farmers attend find life dull always enter service warlike lord follow across sea 
oswald shook head 
quiet pursuits farmer seemed poor substitute excitement border war 
may say mother part would rather enter service percys gain honor banner remain day day merely giving aid driving cattle wondering bairds coming way 
mother shook head 
father two brothers slain last time scottish army crossed border although naturally regard constant troubles light southern woman would viewed still longed peace quiet constant fear sooner later feud bairds powerful family would cost husband life 
open force little fear 
hold could resist attack days long ere yielded help would arrive although watch vigilant every precaution taken might captured sudden night attack 
william baird knew sworn great oath yardhope hold one day destroyed forsters wiped root branch 
death cousin allan last raid would surely fan fire hatred 
one never say may happen said pause time evil befall us escape remember uncle alwyn percy service better go place protection act may advise 
like thought become man arms yet methinks dangerous householder fells 
least strong castle man sleep without fear whereas none say much 
aught happen father mother may sure share 
bairds would spare one captured hold 
although father yet take forays share fighting hold attacked 
sure would oswald captured doubt say would share fate 
speak thought likely things turn say may therefore give advice seek uncle 
capture hold generally little fear fact father wounded three men killed another baird fallen brought possibility may happen closely mind morning usual 
boy best spend hour cleaning father armor arms 
steel cap must go armourer alwinton repair get dints breast back pieces give fresh coat black paint borderers usually darkened armor raids presence betrayed glint sun moon upon 
oswald took armor went steps courtyard sound hammer disturb sleepers 
slight often repeated blows got dents made fray thought mother saying 
also death three men years companions came shock 
seldom indeed forays cattle lifting serious consequences 
rule altogether bloodless long feud bairds fact warning coming party spite precaution reached allan baird present occasion serious results ensued 
cattle would driven without resistance allan baird household would ventured attack strong party 
attempt would made assault hold often heard father say even case blood feud held houses attacked occupants slain 
parties met arms matter different spite slaying father would kill even baird hearthstone 
still baird killed assuredly william baird would deterred similar scruples 
pitiless ferocity notorious even countrymen cried deeds earl douglas several times threatened hand english authorities bairds powerful could allies place four five hundred men field difficult country lived could given great deal trouble even douglas 
therefore nothing come threats bairds continued terror part english border convenient operations 
oswald past sixteen promised big man father fine specimen hardy northumbrian race tall strong sinewy 
felt hurt father refused allow take part foray 
time enough lad time enough said lad made petition 
strong enough yet hold one bairds moss troopers come fighting 
another couple years time enough think going excursion 
clever arms freely admit ought seeing practice two hours day men 
strength counts well skill want ride bairds besides present still much learn paths fells across morasses 
ever become leader must know well enough traverse darkest night thickest mist 
think know father 
yes think side border must learn side well 
indeed even greater importance case pursuit crossing border unobserved 
hitherto forbidden cross line future mat wilson shall go 
knows scotch passes defiles better band go near bairds country traverse safely long truce lasts 
years indeed oswald one hardy little horses ridden country company one men become familiar every morass moor fell pass old roman wall south far north wooler frequently absent three four days time 
several times ridden scotland visit armstrongs friends family always traveled roads knew nothing hill paths side 
life fact far dull many friends connections villages foot cheviots frequently away home 
journeys generally performed horseback father encouraged take long tramps foot order might strengthen muscles would infrequently give leave pay visits condition traveled foot instead saddle 
constant exercise climbing riding weapons wrestling sports including bow hardened every muscle frame capable standing fatigues although father said could hold men knew lad could exceptionally powerful ones believed time came would like frequently chosen leader border forays 
could already draw strongest bow arrowhead send shaft strength would suffice pierce light armor worn scotch borderers 
bow english gained majority victories northern neighbors take weapon unable stand moment english archers loved sport compelled many ordinances practice childhood 
education none respect worse majority knights barons time well content trust monkish scribes draw documents required affix seal 
six years expressed wish sent year care monks rothbury whose superior distant connection father order taught read write john forster scoffed idea 
learn man lad said monks never teach 
know one letter another father forebears worse 
marches unless man means become monk learn make sword guard head send arrow straight mark know every foot passes prepared order lord defend country scots 
vastly important matters reading writing far see use fair man whose word bond deals honest men 
reckon sell many cattle much paid learning want 
every hour spent would good wasted 
monks heaven forfend ever become one 
good men doubt suppose necessary take man full possession limbs mew life four walls passing time vigils saying masses reading books distributing alms seems sort madness 
certainly wish become monk father thought like learn read write 
learned oswald books expensive playthings scrap writing ever inside walls yardhope hold since first built far know 
writing would still less use 
man message send send hired man suits ride 
besides written person sent would able read would go scribe interpretation contents 
lad plenty learn come man without bothering head monkish stuff 
doubt hotspur sign name parchment good enough percys surely good enough 
idea fact put oswald head mother 
time feud bairds burned hotly would lessened anxieties boy bestowed time convent 
oswald felt disappointment father refusal petition would never made mother dilated several occasions upon great advantage learning 
thought repeating request ever entered mind 
father thought several times expressed grave regret wife extraordinary wish occurred son 
boy nothing milksop said age full spirit courage 
strange idea could occurred imagine 
soon expect see owlet sparrow hawk nest monk hatched yardhope hold 
wife discreetly kept silence fact first put idea boy head although mary forster mistress inside hold matters john masterful would brook meddling even 
subject therefore oswald learning read write never renewed 
chapter across border 
vigilant watch kept next week yardhope hold 
night three four troopers posted four five miles hold roads enemy likely come fleetest horses moor 
week passed slight relaxation watch evident bairds intended bide time stroke knowing well would likely able effect surprise present 
outlying posts therefore longer maintained dogs hold fully dozen number chained nightly circle three four hundred yards outside barking would apprise watchers turrets walls approach body armed men 
two days later oswald started promised visit armstrongs 
considered necessary accompanied troopers hiniltie lay miles across frontier 
high spirits galloped away riding yardhope soon alwinton thence took track kidland lee passed round head usmay brook along foot maiden cross hill crossed frontier windy guile 
stood crest cheviots descending passed along foot windburgh hill noon entered tiny hamlet hiniltie perched one spurs hill stood armstrongs hold 
smaller yardhope surrounding wall like built defense sudden attack 
adam armstrong good terms neighbors across border 
although members family frequently engaged forays seldom indeed buckled armor general call arms 
however bad terms bairds partly wife sister forster partly frays arisen herdsmen bairds cattle wandered far wide mountain slopes south sometimes passed ill defined line beyond bairds regarded country 
jedburgh ten miles away hawick six seven stay sun rose would speedily brought strong bodies men towns well still nearer neighbors chester abbotrule hobkirk 
oswald approach seen two cousins allan lad age janet year younger ran house meet 
expecting last ten days former exclaimed well nigh given 
hold laggard girl added unless duly excuse shall naught say 
excuse good one janet 
father made foray fortnight since bairds country rescue cattle driven neighbors days 
sharp fight allan baird killed since expecting return visit sleeping arms beside us 
doubtless come someday evident mean come present father let leave 
case must forgive girl said 
rumors fray reached us father shook head gravely heard another baird killed forsters 
us oswald replied 
liddels hopes families engaged 
father chosen chief time quarrel lost cattle father joined aided us last time could hold back 
course chosen chief knows country well 
well come oswald 
poor hospitality keep talking outside door 
boy already taken charge oswald horse unstrapping valise led stable formed basement house 
well laddie fares home adam armstrong said heartily mounted steps main entrance 
heard wild doings bairds 
tis pity feuds go father son ever getting bitter 
change borderer nature stop tide solway 
hear well nigh pitched battle 
hard fighting oswald replied 
three troopers eight ten others killed 
father twice wounded one hopes killed liddel severely wounded 
say bairds suffered 
done would hot pursuit far know none 
bairds bide time armstrong said gravely 
dour men take turn though wait ten years 
rate catch us sleeping uncle come however strong may find hard work capture hold 
ay ay lad think try knock heads wall 
like sweep sudden watchman need keen eyes make thundering gate climbing wall 
however father knows danger use talking 
done done 
mother oswald mistress armstrong asked 
well aunt bade give love 
truly wonder keeps health troubles anxieties 
hoped meeting last march commissioners sides lords marches plighted faith agreed surrender prisoners without ransom forgive offenders peace border 
know three exceptions named namely adam warden william baird adam french scotch commissioners bound arrest hand english commissioners tried notorious truce breakers infinite mischief dwellers english side border 
yet nothing come men still continue make raids without check hindrance either earl march douglas 
faults sides wife husband said 
deny gudeman often heard say three men pests border things might go reasonably enough one counts head cattle lifted 
bad enough every two three years armies march across border one way surely might live peaceably times 
nearly lose otterburn laid hands well nigh six months ay sore day sides 
tell uncle oswald asked 
father cares much talk though know fought never told story battle 
going sit dinner adam armstrong said story long one done tell 
father need feel sore since days bruce many victories count 
dinner however armstrong settle dispute two tenants grazing rights evening told story 
sorts troubles england france naturally took advantage recommenced hostilities prepared share game 
word sent round privately every man bidden gather jedburgh forest 
tell lad went heavy heart although men name reputation quarrelsome fellows dwell border exception love peace quiet moreover children young saw fight would heavy business like leaving mother 
however help gathered strong 
main body marched away cumberland douglas march moray spears footmen including many armstrong entered northumberland 
marched without turning right left staying attack town castle house till crossed river tyne entered durham 
began war burning ravaging slaying 
liked although comes fighting ready needs bear part care attack peaceful people 
true kings laid waste half scotland killing slaying hanging seem satisfaction twenty ancestors murdered slay twenty people born long afterwards whose forbears aught know may hand slaughter mine 
however laden plunder durham sat three days newcastle sharp skirmishes sir henry brother sir ralph percy one captured sir henry pennant 
marched away otterburn receiving warning percy intended win pennant back left northumberland 
attacked otterburn castle failed carry strong well defended 
council night leaders favor retiring scotland abundance spoil gained 
douglas persuaded remain two three days capture castle go afraid percy threats 
waited next day night percys spears infantry came 
leaders idle examined ground carefully arranged battle fought attacked 
heard nothing english day lay sleep expecting hear aught morning 
moonlight night august short darkness twilights english arriving made attack falling first servants huts took chiefs 
gave us time form good order lain proper position 
portion force went skirmish english front greater portion marched along mountain side fell suddenly upon english flank 
first great confusion english numerous soon recovered order pushed us back though without much loss sides 
douglas shouted battle cry advanced banner fighting bravely sir patrick hepburn whose bravery douglas banner would taken percys hearing cry douglas douglas pressed part field bore us backwards 
midst ten kinsmen though fought became men pressed back began think day would lost 
young earl furious seeing disaster threaten dashed midst english ranks swinging battle axe time cutting way 
one man strength courage go little fray 
knights squires followed darkness perceived advance 
presently three knights met spears pierced borne horse mortally wounded 
happily english unaware douglas fallen 
known courage would mightily raised day would assuredly lost 
ignorant douglas fallen still fought 
parts field march moray holding bravely 
sir ralph percy like douglas charged almost alone moray ranks sorely wounded surrounded surrendered sir john maxwell 
elsewhere many captures made parties fight went advantage turned side rested day began battle fresh hours sleep english marched eight leagues weary began fight 
sir james lindsay sir walter sinclair knights followed douglas found still alive 
last words ordered raise banner shout douglas friends foes think party 
instructions followed 
others pressed forwards hearing shout soon large party collected resumed battle point 
moray march bore arrays direction believed douglas battling together pressed upon english hardly retreated five miles pursued hotly 
many prisoners taken quality put ransom allowed depart giving knightly word payment within fifteen days 
great victory truth none us well knew come english fought well valiantly ill wearied men fight fresh ones 
never surprised found battle time gone mightily us yet end 
methinks great extent due fact englishman fought previous day received strictest orders fight man leader hold together obey orders respects kept companies end gained day foe brave much numerous 
thank uncle armstrong 
often wondered percys three one yet defeated fighting ground 
tis long indeed since suffered great reverse 
true enough oswald 
days wallace bruce scots often battles long odds us fought foot english part horseback method good enough open plain ill fitted land morass hill like scotland 
since english also took fighting foot chances equal repulsed invasions much force falling back wasting country english choice retreating starving 
reason indeed equal forces arrayed chances also equal come stock men northern marches england scotland alike hardy accustomed war 
united people english methinks would never constant wars us english kings would cared invaded country would find little spoil hard work take 
nobles always ready turn traitors 
mostly norman blood norman name small part estates england well scotland 
hence worst enemies always midst 
time bed heavy morning know intend starting dawn dogs promised bring hares dinner 
oswald allan janet also afoot early taking basin porridge started hills accompanied four dogs 
carried bows arrows case dogs drive hares within shot 
six hours later returned carrying five hares brace birds 
fallen oswald bow shot ground days idea unsportsmanlike shoot game except flying unknown 
week went every day sometimes dogs often hawks trained fly birds flight hares whose heads alighted pecking beating fiercely wings gave time party foot run despatch quarry arrow 
twice accompanied adam armstrong rode towns neighborhood spent day friends armstrongs 
fortnight time passed pleasantly english lad end time adam armstrong returned visit jedburgh grave face 
news said king richard deposed henry duke lancaster landed yorkshire joined percy earl westmoreland proclaimed king 
cause great troubles england surely must many tamely see king dethroned treasonable practices another title crown promoted place 
thing contrary reason justice 
king right crown noble estates none may justly take away save treasonable practices king commit treason 
therefore like much trouble england fear chance truce concludes end month continued 
fact two great northern lords england forces south encourage trouble peace small intermissions continued since battle otterburn like broken 
therefore lad think best cut short visit week shall return finish matters settled 
scotland without troubles 
ill blood arisen march douglas owing duke ramsay breaking promise marry earl march daughter taking douglas girl wife 
sorely angered one powerful either douglas march mean course albany really exercises kingly power 
troubles scotland way prevent war breaking england 
contrary quarrel two great lords marches cause loose hold border men foresee shall frays forays among worst times old 
therefore best went home 
things going private friendship many families either side border must suspended intercourse maybe every man either side called arms assuredly safe one either nation set foot across border save armed strong clump spears back 
shall sorry indeed go oswald said see troubles fear break conclusion peace fortnight hence may wait adam armstrong interrupted 
truce truce long strong enough enforce douglas march variance side northumberland westmoreland absent none see truce broken hear may many days see smoke burning houses rising upon either side border 
reason going home oswald said 
father likely last fray assuredly would like away across border swords drawn 
sorry see help tomorrow daybreak start home 
evening dullest oswald spent visit 
prospect two nations might soon engaged another desperate struggle saddened young cousins felt long time might elapse met meantime fathers possibly might fighting opposite ranks 
although breaches truces caused rule little bloodshed fact cattle lifting expeditions different time war wholesale massacres took place sides towns villages burned whole inhabitants put sword 
ten years sufficed soften memory events especially among young people heard numberless stories wrong slaughter felt war broke earnest little hope would change manner would conducted 
oswald rode rapidly crossed border 
truce would expire another thirteen days raiders might work moment assuredly would chance complaints made eve recommencement general hostilities 
met one road reached first hamlet english side 
stopped give horse half hour rest feed 
dismounted two three villagers came 
heard aught lad gatherings side border none came talk notices sent southern scottish marches readiness gather banner without delay summons received 
heard man said 
made everything readiness drive cattle fells beacons prepared lighting berwick carlisle assuredly scotch find little near border carry back 
son stout john forster yardhope keep saw riding side two months since alwinton fair 
yes 
hot work scotch army marches tynedale 
bairds sure muster strongly forgive last raid whichever way go may sure father hold receive visit 
return raid oswald said 
bairds way short time lifted cattle horses could lay hands miles round 
true enough 
know thieving loons 
men remember injuries suffered better inflicted count allan baird death set score forays 
bairds settle hold walls oswald said whole scotch army come way must drive cattle hills leave harm stone walls find hard work damage 
aye heard stronger ordinary need seeing blood feud bairds 
well like much time waste sheriff already sent word places gather beacon fires lighted may sure percys lose time marching array scots like find found easier thing cross border get back 
late evening oswald returned home 
first greetings father said high time back oswald 
rumour busy along border though doubt moss troopers move soon truce ends think invasion force little time 
great lords scotch marches ill friends quarrel douglas dunbar patched neither venture march forces england 
may months yet see pennons flying english soil 
brother alwyn day two since away 
percys south free ride

served percys thirty years ten captain men arms never asked aught either relations percy gave favourable answer said return would present found lad manners would suitable member household would grant request partly father always stanch men ready times join banner summoned fight doughtily 
seems good chance preferment 
mother willing go 
says truly enough stay engage forebears done constant feuds scots harrying harried never knowing lie rest may woke battle shout bairds leaving behind us die took fathers 
know thoughts may run matter oswald methinks much says though wish nothing better accustomed 
percy would knighted wished years ago plain jock forster born die time comes would alter condition way save jock forster lead raid across border sir john forster would hardly seemly save open war countries 
different case young fit another mode life win sword better fortune inherit 
besides lad like enough unless baird spear finishes sooner live another thirty years yet always sure lead trouble two cocks one farmyard 
would notions matters done mine many reasons right go world 
matters go well better always welcome back master gone 
say comes suddenly upon father always thought like see something world beyond dales would gladly time least accept uncle offer rare one far beyond hopes 
sorry leave mother save seems would best go world time

smile ran round faces esquires brother roger pugnacious instincts widely known 
truly sir henry brother roger lose patience would hard indeed could get truth desire improve speaks well lad disposition 
hotspur left allonby said take seat master oswald 
first dined took meal hour since uncle oswald replied 
ay remember uncle sticks old hours 
tell us father foray headed carry cattle lifted bairds heard report last night 
great disappointment said another year must pass fit hold fray 
affair somewhat hot one 
three father men killed ten twelve leaders father several band wounded sorely 
happened thus 
told details affair 
might well worse allonby said bairds time assemble would gone hardly father party especially heard blood feud 
scored last success oswald said seeing accompanied sir richard rutherford raid nigh two months ago hear rest came harrying plundering croquetdale bairds gathering remained hold found deserted indeed father could hope defend successfully large force employed demolishing outer wall much hold would completed task defeat inflicted upon rest scots sir robert umfraville forced hasten back across border 
father sent message afterwards saying mother followers forced take fells return found place well nigh destroyed going set work rebuild hoped time demolish bairds hold like fashion 
time place restored father means limited retainers would turn masons materials doubted time would make good job 
truly hard life border squire said wonderful found willing live within reach scotch raiders 
done fair share fighting lord banner pass life never knowing whether may awake find house assailed would worse hardest service open foe 
master oswald go courtyard see instructors done matter arms 
practising since came principally godfrey harpent dick bamborough william anell turn great many men arms 
three men name stout fellows good swordsmen 
borderer suppose practiced lance call knightly term 
us spear nought else borderers carry fighting pricking cattle time could sit horse always practiced every day father troopers using blunt weapons whitened chalk show hits fell 
although charge upon footmen border spearmen would couch weapons ride straight foe skirmishes single enemy series single combats fight circle round trusting agility horses avoid thrust deliver one opening 
spears nothing like heavy knightly lances thrust point sword 
way hardly penetrate armor one esquires said 
downright charge try 
fighting speak thrust face armpit joints armor truth seldom fits closely breastplate 
scotch use even less armor borderers breast pieces smaller seldom wear back pieces 
question chiefly activity horses skill riders little moor horses active young goats although neither horse rider stand charge heavily armed knight squire methinks one troopers brought stand would get better save knight took mace battle axe 
horse oswald yes stable 
gone every morning soon castle gates opened ridden couple hours began exercises 
take hand first marsden allonby said one younger esquires young man two three twenty 
light steel caps cheeks gorgets shoulder arm pieces padded leathern jerkins put blunted swords took places facing 
squire took position easy confidence 
good swordsman good naturedly determined treat lad easily play time scoring first hit 
soon however found game conducted lines laid 
oswald waiting minute two finding opponent take offensive time marsden work defend 
several times indeed greatest difficulty guarded head 
activity assailant almost bewildered continually shifted position cat like springs leapt dealt blow leaping back opponent arm time fall 
finding last quick might marsden blade always met oswald relaxed efforts growing fatigued marsden took offensive pressing backwards foot foot 
every time however found approaching barrier obstacle would prevent retreat oswald couple springs managed shift ground 
saw marsden growing breathless exertions took offensive last landed blow fairly opponent helm 
faith squire said laugh nevertheless little mortification would soon fight wildcat yet breath scarce comes fast much left would fill eggshell 
excellent display allonby said 
truly lad activity wonderful might well puzzle oldest swordsman tactics 
marsden exceedingly well 
many times thought sword would gone home last guard always ready time 
scarce opportunity seeing sword would guard head trusted always legs rather arms 
well lad 
arm like iron would tired long sword little heavy 
wind would tire stoutest swordsman percys train 
say press battle activity would count little good man arms would get better single combat plenty room would good man indeed would tackle especially clad armor fighting without 
chance would get one downright blow would break guard 
marsden says fight like wildcat rather man arms time may come ride heavy armor lose advantage agility best continue practice regularly us men arms learn fight fashion would needed engaged pitched battle horseback armor 
shall glad indeed oswald said modestly 
know ignorant real swordsmanship men arms quite mercy insist upon shifting ground 
home practiced father troopers always fight foot stout sticks instead swords without defences save head pieces fighting knightly fashion knew nothing came 
soon acquire lad 
strength arm length wind quickness eye activity make famous swordsman time 
ah sir henry 
trying lad metal hotspur asked saw oswald act taking steel cap 
marsden already done 
sir henry find proof 
marsden mean blade taken hand lad held much swordsmanship activity wind 
curious contest 
marsden compared oswald wildcat comparison ill one indeed springs leaps rapid sudden difficult follow fight like one animal hound 
marsden defended well attacks breath failed dealt downright blow helm see made shrewd dent 
blows fell upon air lad ever reach ripostes came 
style fighting would wager man arms castle 
glad hear hotspur said 
shall feel less scruple sending missions without danger 
need training fit combat ranks 
doubt opportunity teaching would go heavy armed man lance like blade grass millstone 
thinks sir henry least single combat accounts horse nimble course charges horse would rolled say 
thinks oh well try hour spare 
put suit full armor sinclair ride course beyond castle 
put lad put breast piece steel cap said chance lance sir henry 
pretend could stand man arms armed sword mace thought horse could evade shock fully accoutred man harass maybe wound spear 
well try lad 
put get horse saddled 
rare amusement see unequal course 
shall ready quarter hour 
oswald went uncle told proposed 
alwyn witnessed exercises rough riders father smiled grimly 
evade first charge doubt mercy light spear lance moor horse charger put heaviest two steel caps strong shoulder pieces 
tis like enough temper may throw away lance betake sword 
demand carries neither mace battle axe carry sword spear 
horse nimbleness may keep harm much expect hope 
put light breast plate spite wooden shield lance head may hurt sorely chance strike 
oswald saw horse carefully saddled 
procured uncle piece cloth removing spearhead wrapped round head shaft formed ball size fist 
whitened thickly chalk 
minutes sinclair heaviest strongest esquires rode courtyard full armor 
sir henry esquires several gentlemen earl household came hotspur laughed contrast presented two combatants one mass steel shield lance warhorse fully caparisoned slight active looking figure little defensive armor rough pony scarce ounce superfluous flesh 
gentlemen said may engaged warfare scots long opportunity seeing nature border fighting 
combat may seem ridiculously unequal know moss trooper tell single combat like activity goes far counterbalance weight armor 
remember robert bruce bannockburn mounted pony struck sir robert bohun good knight powerful one 
party went gates tilting ground outside walls men arms seeing something unusual going take place crowded battlements looking ground 
gentlemen percy said take places opposite ends field drop scarf charge 
understood need necessarily ride straight free best overthrow opponent 
gave signal two riders dashed full speed moment spectators thought oswald going mad enough meet opponent full course 
however horses within length rough pony swerved aside spring like deer wheeling round instantly oswald followed opponent 
latter tried wheel charger oswald spear struck vizor leaving white mark side slit wheeled horse maintaining position left hand somewhat rear opponent thereby wholly unable use lance oswald marked junction gorget helmet several white circles 
furious finding incapable either defending striking blow squire threw away lance drew sword 
hotspur shouted top voice breach rules breach rules combat end 
words unheard helmet

hotspur round ran forward 
sinclair lay without moving stunned force fallen 
oswald already leapt horse raised sinclair head began unlace fastenings helmet

hotspur face cleared

presently opened eyes 
heavy fall thought little days sinclair raised feet looked round bewilderment standing round hotspur said good temperedly well master sinclair lad given us lesson may useful us 
would scarce believed seen stout soldier full armor worsted lad rough pony see advantage latter side combat like plenty room wheel horse

sinclair hot tempered generous disposition held hand oswald frankly 
fair fight said worsted altogether 
one bears malice fair fall joust 
conditions even oswald said 
pony like mine unless caught full career impossible matter could turned otherwise 
often wondered hotspur said walked towards gate chivalry often worsted rough scottish troopers understand 
scotch always choose broken ground always scatter get near circling round fall upon chivalry weight array use 
happily misadventure never happened might well 
scotch regard laws chivalry behind spear horse indeed happened otterburn 
tis lesson war one may well take heart next fight scots order account whatever mounted men break ranks whatever happens move solid body case could defy attacks upon light armed horse however numerous 
gate castle alwyn forster met 
given useful addition following dreamt alwyn hotspur said 
see conflict watched wall sir henry 
felt sure matter would end 
lad quick sharp border exercises 
seen work father troopers 
many could hold fighting way would back moss troopers best horsemen europe 
always accustomed fight man though score men arms would ride hundred met charge single combat activity nimbleness horses would render match fully caparisoned knight 
seems hotspur said yet sinclair known lad swerve course indeed ought known would madness meet charge changed course left couple lengths away might sure lad would turn way get left hand case would ridden like thunderbolt 
yes sir henry oswald would eye knee bridle moment horse changed direction would round way like arrow bow would planted squire rear 
perhaps hotspur said thoughtfully 
rate alwyn boy given us lesson done good service presenting 
chapter mission 
next three four months oswald little castle percy utilizing services manner agreeable sending errands various knights gentlemen different parts northumberland fortified places held english across border 
fortnight contest sinclair sir henry formally appointed one esquires

messenger useful traveling one esquires one without settled rank send written communications charge speak fully name authority 
oswald slow finding advantages position gave 
first errands sent treated ordinary messenger placed dinner salt herded men arms 
esquire lord percy treated courtesy introduced ladies family sat high table regarded confidence lord 
youth excited little surprise acted favor evident percy would nominated one esquires shown particular merit 
journeys often passed near yardhope rebuilding wall keep pushed much vigor inhabitants villages valley lending assistance restore fortalice regarded place refuge case sudden invasion scots 
parents greatly pleased promotion especially mother always anxious settle adventurous dangerous life led father 
lady john forster said though six months since first left us changed rarely

tis father replied 
received letter two days since brother alwyn written hand monk acquaintance telling lord percy mightily pleased set read write way defeated one esquires bout arms 
alwyn said doubted would win knightly spurs soon came full manhood 
clear merit something advancement though may also due extent cause assign 
monk wrote letter added account preceptor though often rated soundly made wonderful progress 
monk good teacher oswald laughed would made better man arms ever make monk 
believe pleased worsted sinclair indeed small thing seeing idea fighting save charging straight foe progress made books 
commands contingent monastery sends percy takes field repel invasion could would gladly exchange monk robes harness man arms

naturally promised contingent fighting men ready case serious invasion scots oswald able gather manner whether promises would surely fulfilled whether case trouble knights likely keep array defense castles join percy general movement 
one day oswald engaged six months work taken several times cumberland westmoreland well north lord percy summoned private apartment 
hitherto done well oswald feel trust mission far higher importance hitherto performed 
tis without dangers know like none less reason 
young indeed business importance seems around would best fitted carry 
manner speech changed much since came doubtless fall border dialect differs little side pass well enough coming jedburgh place across border 
world knows lad george earl march dunbar mightily offended rothesay breaking match daughter marrying child rival douglas going tell world know secret would cost many life blabbed abroad tell perfect confidence discretion 
anger march mostly called side border scotland often call earl dunbar goes beyond mere displeasure douglas sullen resentment rothesay 
sent confidential messenger intimating ready acknowledge king sovereign place forces disposal 
see surprised indeed natural marches ever rather england scotland although never gone far throw allegiance scottish throne 
us consider whether march acting treacherously james scotland whether acting good faith towards us 
easy send messenger since scotland trades england ship bound london might well touch one ports way presence englishman dunbar would readily explained 
messenger especially enjoined send communication writing even trustworthy hand since accident might precipitate matters drive take arms position give aid 
therefore first place wish journey dunbar see earl deliver message shall give endeavor inform far trusted 
say scarce bring believe really throw allegiance scotland save event great english army marching north doubtless would scotch nobles always done namely hasten give submission make best terms 
tis business like although duty accept proposal made good faith would vast value king 
must seeing earl return speed bear message march may give report impressions sincerity good faith 
tis month since received message 
since communicated king received authority arrange terms march guarantee possession lordships hand certain tracts douglas country bargained assure support 
must told king urges delay present taking open steps first place bound truce arranged next two years second cause quarrel scotland present newly seated throne would difficulty raising army invasion country

abbot came left among things mentioned friar roger fallen disgrace gone far strike sub prior cheek almost breaking jaw worthy man finding discipline punishment avail expel disgrace community

time could say nothing discipline must maintained monastery well castle abbot left walking vexation affair like rascal spite ways one else could well lead contingent monastery thought occurred 
like going altogether alone times lawless might meet trouble road yet see could send 
seems stout knave would make excellent companion 
first place like likes secondly monk traveling north mission say abbot prior monastery near dunbar could pass anywhere unheeded third place although peaceful man could carry military arms might yet take staff warrant would match two three ordinary men lastly may able convince abbot thus get rid monastery time avoid scandals occasions yet hold available return military service 
say lad like much sir henry

hour later brother roger came captain quarters

next morning pair rode castle daybreak 
roger dressed usual monkish attire time long loose gown cape head covering resembling small turban

roger reluctantly allowed oswald fasten staff beside 
one wants something one hands said 
foot matter much horseback feel ought spear hand sword dangling side

best moderate speed horse although ambles along merrily present never carry great carcase pace journey 
like one good gallop roger sighed pulled rein horse proceeded pace better suited appearance rider 
nice figure would look robes streaming behind oswald laughed 
would soon story going country mad monk 
take turning right leave main north road bound first place roxburgh 
thought must berwick though asked questions

supposed come master oswald otherwise would told provide staff 
journeyed pleasantly along 
whenever approached town large village oswald reined back horse little head level roger stirrup 
slept night kirknewton put small hostelry 
oswald intended going monastery roger begged earnestly put elsewhere yielded 
end questions asked journey across border object roger said always goes conscience lie unless upon pressing occasions 
moreover oswald said laugh might expected get join community prayers midnight might give monk bed instead comfortable one guest chambers 
may something roger admitted often sleep stone bench punishment offences weakness soft bed get one 
however oswald pleased see follower behaved resting place discretion could hoped although somewhat surprised host heartiness appetite hand moderate potations talked little retiring bed thick rushes curfew 
truth afraid trust said oswald lay side side 
never felt free since otterburn never indeed since unfortunate day wounded conceived fatal idea becoming monk 
two three times impulse troll trooper song strong clap hand mouth keep 
tis well roger assuredly committed first day starting must sent back alnwick feeling would safe proceed farther 
get upon cheviots tomorrow may lift voice choose best confined latin canticle even habit breaking songs kind might grow upon 
roger said seriously 
canticles plenty ring go words matter seeing understand 
next morning resumed journey crossed cheviots comparatively low hills four hours riding arrived roxburgh 
come roger asked 
would surely much shorter traveled berwick along coast road 
much shorter roger sir henry thought better go inland haddington thence east dunbar thus entering town would seem came edinburgh western monastery whereas journey coast road might guessed come england

evident someone consequence secret business sir philip 
well bear malice would got hot governor reported said 
chapter dunbar 
journey passed without incident importance oswald reason congratulate taken monk 
one occasion passing wild heath party eight ten men rough ponies rode 
armed spears swords 
reined exclamations disappointment roger rolled robe round waist convenience walking let fall round 
played us scurvy trick monk leader said angrily 
guess monk thus striding along would find difficult walk robe dangling heels roger said 
whither bound whence going traveling dunbar sent convent saint magnus come roxburgh 
tis shame stalwart fellow leading drone life convent every true scotsman sharpening spear readiness may come truce england expires 
glad hear well employed roger replied methinks days like sometimes useful men thews sinews even religious house sometimes fail respect owe church 
true enough men laughed 
well go thy way 
naught gained traveling monk 
naught good friend save occasionally hard blows monk happens strength stature carries staff like 
tis goodly weapon sooth look knew wield 
even monk may know seeing staff carnal weapon 
rolling sleeves roger took staff middle hands manner quarterstaff made play round head speed vigor showed complete master exercise 
enough enough man said exclamations admiration broke others 
truly champion strong enough wield weapon resembles weaver beam rather quarterstaff would hard knocks silver gained pity skill strength thrown away convent 
perhaps well wearing monk gown methinks eight one us might got broken heads gained pence pocket 
come men 
better luck next time 
clear man one charged capture 
followers rode across moor 
think seem oswald said resumed journey 
man speech border raider followers would hardly sat horses silently obeyed orders promptly merely thieving caterans besides marked said man watching 
think master oswald think possible may party douglas followers led knight 
may douglas received hint march communication england sent party seize search traveller looked like messenger south 
course may fancy 
still right glad wearing monkish robe alone might cross questioned shrewdly purpose traveling might held suspicion means employed get truth 
small town stopped next night learned many complaints made travellers south stopped party armed men border closely questioned searched cases robbed 
going weeks sheriff county twice collected armed force ridden search robbers altogether without success 
believed strangers district description given agreed noted bad characters neighborhood 
certainly master oswald monk said seems support idea 
money valuables soon found men say way clothes belongings travellers searched would seem show money object band rather discovery correspondence money taken cloak 
doubt intercept someone roger though may percy messengers still well rid hope shall meet way 
hope fulfilled reached dunbar without interruption 
deemed better separate 
monk went convent gave way edinburgh journey thither see aged father last sickness

earl tall powerfully built man looked keen scrutiny 
come young sir holder ring lord earl oswald said presenting ring percy given 
name oswald forster honor one lord percy esquires

signet ring would shown coming 
concealed staff lord could discovered split open 
admitted lord percy indeed committed signet writing carry bid travel servitor monk journey north delivered knew nothing 
lord percy selected messenger partly youth likely suspected messenger two great lords second place arrested matters found statement letter would readily believed 
would supposed important state secrets would committed lad like 
earl made reply time sat eyes fixed oswald face reading thoroughly 
know matters question lord 
bearer communication 
say 
lord percy bids say receipt message forwarded one knights king westminster matter discussed majesty two three trusted councillors 
full consideration king accepted offer grant conditions 
sent lord also document royal seal attached engaging observe conditions compact 
document lord percy holds given convenient occasion deemed important nature would hazardous send 
king letter lord percy begged tell long truce continued could collect army support time termination approached would begin would readiness take field north immediately move matter 
earl sat time thought 
know conditions compact asked suddenly 
oswald expected question felt sure earl inflamed anger cool cautious man would highly disapprove hotspur frankness might possibly detain knew possessed important secret 
therefore replied grave matters necessary know said lord earl 
secret douglases personal enmity deemed compact referred king giving aid need douglases 
answer apparently satisfactory 
earl asked questions head 
reasons stated chose messenger another reason gave lord came family reside within miles border relatives side sometimes visited language similar spoken roxburghshire could therefore pass lowland scot without difficulty 
one fact various places stopped taken aught countryman though monk often taxed englishman though belonging monastery roxburgh 
earl silent time 
must think message shall give percy said 
like delay though see good reason 
one hotspur esquires would fain treat courtesy lodge might cause question therefore better lodge town 
put anywhere rested hour sign lion lord engaging room order effect change clothes 
left back entrance order change observed 
best fetched traveled away rather returned unnoticed getting dark doubtless managed sally place cloak shoulders hide dress servitor go inn falcon 
say staying days dunbar come business bade go might know send necessary 
pass seem young trader come edinburgh arrange part father cloth merchant supply stuffs clothing retainers 
oswald carried instructions walked quite dark entered inn made way unobserved chamber left clothes put made others bundle went downstairs paid bill saying found friends came see room take 
leaving house threw cloak carried arm shoulders put cap belonged dress went falcon inn repeating landlord statement earl made shown chamber deference 
worship supper room come said 
dull work sitting alone 
ordered supper flask wine oswald donned attire trader went downstairs 
entered room several persons sitting soldier came outer door 
looked round room 
message earl person afternoon 
oswald rose went across 
earl bade tell soldier said low voice present furnisher robert micklethwaite place business near castle gate edinburgh 
please thank earl information oswald replied returned seat 
indeed dressing wondering name give 
like enough dunbar many might know names principal traders edinburgh give unknown one might questioned place business 
message therefore relieved difficulty 
finished supper excellent one beckoned landlord 
stranger landlord said 
pray drink cup tell news place 
may know name micklethwaite went landlord sat comes sends regularly arrange supply cloth quality price required earl retainers 
master micklethwaite always puts visits dunbar landlord said 
must misunderstood one day talking said trouble sons 
oswald said luckily nephew 
good customer landlord went good company cares french wines trouble cellarer much 
careful man oswald said smile though good trencherman waste money matters 
however lets freer hand uses asks return close account outgoings 
say chances another war england fear worst landlord replied 
wars ruin us english gates dunbar many times already town sacked burnt heads 
though say might worse earls ever stood aloof much possible often inclined towards english side 
still even bad enough whole country berwick often wasted check progress armies trade well nigh ruined 
pest wars say way think present earl leanings would go think one way 
business sell food liquor earl take part affairs state 
days like quite enough man attend business without troubling people especially powerful noble thinks little enough slitting tongue wags freely 
lad john sanderson fool knows better open mouth touching affairs great nobles 
know may burghers edinburgh content cool porridge let others take food hot cold choose 
wishing give much ideas common talk town see question indiscreet ask pardon 
know meant harm lad question one young man age might ask without thinking harm answering might lead harm 
tell whatever folk may think dunbar say naught nearest neighbor 
talk war england common thing harm one knows aught one man opinion good another talk general assuredly man asks neighbor great lord matters go 
harm two gossips wondering whether english come town hold till help comes whether batter walls first 
kind riddle see one knows may king side storm breaks 
generation back men might make fair guess beyond wisest head say part leave thinking concerns 
edinburgh ought know great cities men talk freely seeing one lord place hands citizens rights hold 
general thought shall war directly truce 
among us live peaceful trade still hope peace see good comes war save make raids england often get hard knocks plunder quiet trader means loss may well mean ruin english army marches scotland 
discover reason two countries live peaceably together going business 
heard said would good thing countries border districts sides stripped altogether people allowed lie desolate 
ay would rare thing 
thieving loons sides border keep ill feeling loss would great seeing plenty waste tracts people might bestowed pass time profitably raising crops cattle destroying carrying neighbors 
however young sir like time 
afraid sanderson must needs make best things stand 
think twould well english come north capture edinburgh ruin trade years cross seas france take service 
scarce spoken like peaceful trader landlord laughed doubt would make good soldier sword would suit hand full well yard measure 
well makes much difference 
men must eat drink though wine would drunk without payment run risk killed walls english came know short time men would come go drink good wine money pay six months trade would brisk ever men seem think time scots invade england english barons enough wars france slow furnishing quota called shall carry fire sword northern counties 
may though northumberland hotspur doubtless something say 
fear many time 
armies march back plunder news damage done inflame england great army march north 
nobles hasten make terms harm damage fall upon quiet people nought whatever invasion 
true enough young sir true enough though shame said 
cities voice matter peace war may right sure hear invasions troubles side border 
say would peace claims english kings authority scotland although heard much since bannockburn abeyance first time really peace france may sure shall hear towns well country would join heartily repelling invasion 
never past time sanderson 
generally opened gates closed strong garrison knight noble townspeople say matter 
methinks bed long day travel 
next day passed without message earl following morning one retainers castle came message earl desired presence mr micklethwaite 
oswald went 
earl alone 
thinking master forster would safer tarry 
came safely true might good fortune return even though sent written answer would enough percy signet found upon ensure imprisonment perhaps death 
rate would means wringing mission charge could send equally well message sea 
see might slight danger lord earl oswald said quietly well another might take passage ship touching berwick port 
earl brow clouded 
tis matter thought said moodily 
ship might captured seeing often french freebooting vessels coast 
orders lord percy return immediately conveyed message 
would gladly hasten departure earl said moment pause see great issues hang upon affair 
however think matter see best managed 
leaving castle oswald went convent monk lodged asked speech brother roger

case boat would put six maybe seven clock 
would two hours later roger 
dark easy enough silence man without attracting much attention broad daylight would easily done 
went straight inn port master need take route 
right roger 
indeed would better idea escaped water earl might send fast boat us 
therefore come turn go unfrequented streets lanes opposite direction 
way better able see followed may find quiet place give man clout head rid us

oswald returned inn half hour later went doorway stood idly watching flow traffic 
quarter hour later saw roger approaching 
looked character assumed life 
dirtied hands face smudged smock stains mud 
strolled along free step head erect 
look oswald passed said boat sails seven tonight 
oswald stood time longer 
short distance street observed two earl retainers 
standing apparently looking goods mercer window 
time moved short distance passed inn stopped look another shop twenty thirty yards away 
oswald left door 
landlord standing passage beckoned enter private room 
young sir said know whether done anything displeased earl business mine fair spoken young gentlemen would ill came

sorry return uncle without getting order earl years one best customers 
landlord nodded 
understand said 
would well perhaps say much hearing one drawers questioned shall witness bear 
chapter back hotspur 
still broad daylight half past six oswald left inn sauntered leisurely pace street 
eye fell roger tall figure also saw two retainers earl loitering 
men seen morning doubtless relieved watch 
took first turning main street passing several lanes found foot town wall 
narrow lane ran row small houses 
one thought roger would take advantage loneliness spot endeavor rid followers whose footsteps could hear distance behind 
presently glanced carelessly round 
men thirty forty yards behind coming rapid step roger 
minute later heard voice raised anger 
going fellow plenty room pass without pushing us 
want teaching manners 
roger gave loud laugh 
going teach said 
one men said angrily placing hand upon sword hilt 
levelled ground tremendous blow roger staff 
shout soldier drew sword could guard staff descended fell senseless beside comrade 
roger knelt beside tore strips garments rolling pressed mouths string brought purpose tied place 
taking pieces cord tied hands behind ankles together dragged dark entry left lying 
whole transaction occupied two three minutes attracted attention whatever 
soldiers shout might heard clashing weapons shout unimportant matter anyone within hearing take trouble 
oswald seeing roger needed assistance occupied stripping outer pair leggings made cloak cap bundle pressing drover cap eyes ready time roger came 
splendidly managed roger 
well enough said carelessly 
may hour anyone stumbles long shall sea 
made way back quiet lanes near port boldly went side small craft

even great chance overtaken 
traveling fast another hour dark long daybreak shall reach leith wind tide favor way

fancied could see sail twilight falling neither could sure effect imagination 
already ten miles away tide begun make along shore certain time least ship however fast might would gain little upon fairly entered firth

lay agreed would keep awake turns made ship apparently pursuing would offer skipper full value boat betake row shore 
greatest danger roger said would passing us unseen lying near entrance port overhauling us came 
danger guard 
swim roger years since done monk replied used old days 
empty cask side oswald went 
challenged best plan would lower quietly water hold 
boat would certainly go distance lost way brought sight ships came together 
good idea 
hear hail cut good length rope twist round barrel us hold 
think chance overhauled

kept vigilant watch night without catching sight craft proceeding direction 
still dark helmsman hailed skipper see lights leith ahead later passed beacon fire marked entrance port 
five minutes later oswald companion paying sum agreed stepped shore 
danger 
think real cause fear 
like see earl bands horsemen ride today news hear nothing us 
like hit clout staff gave two retainers roger said 
earl scandalous contrary usages arrest messenger especially messenger esquire one equal rank message suppose friendly one 
much blame 
means judging discretion consequences others fallen hands douglas marauding leader might serious indeed 
doubt content stay would treated honor 
might even done got send another messenger percy latter bade return moreover said another mission soon carried present one successful termination 
done master oswald yes think roger 
ascertain earl real intentions regarding certain matters think means honestly adhere offer made 
fear shown lest intentions betrayed seems prove anxious naught occur interfere plans 
earls dunbar ever treacherous race roger said earnestly ready betray countrymen order curry favor england continue possession estates 
however benefited need grumble scots contented 
master oswald next say better find corner lie daybreak 
think either us slept 
go tavern breakfast afterwards go edinburgh 
like see town castle chance may never come 
tomorrow morning start earnest

fortunately soon came upon fishing nets carelessly piled lee stack timber 
threw soon fast asleep

entering port 
chase us see gain fishing boat

soon learn boat come dunbar find men disguises worn us 
best lose time getting leith 
would never dare seize us oswald said 
know 
strict orders bring us back would feel much hesitation seizing us wherever found us knowing well enough burghers leith would concern greatly capture two drovers would probably charged sorts crime 
one citizens would different scarce likely burghers would care quarrel powerful noble sake two strangers low degree 
gates open shall safer edinburgh 
accordingly postponed breakfast passing town without pause issued south gate walked briskly edinburgh 
soon arrived found small tavern partook hearty meal 
listening ate conversation going around found young duke rothesay present staying castle

benefit way men like taxation support extravagance touches us 
murmur assent little group talking struck oswald farmers come country sell cattle butchers town 
interrupted talk landlord came across 
good friends said pray talk loudly concerning princes nobles 
true royal city burghers edinburgh rights liberties nevertheless dangerous talk loud concerning nobles 
quiet people none wear cognizance douglas albany 
still would much harm reported talk concerning powerful nobles though douglas might care little said methinks others name names would spare neither great small incurred resentment 
knew talking loudly john ker methinks none save two men near table heard words look honest fellows enough 
still say right may talk things firesides tis best keep silent tongue abroad 
need disquiet us roger broke 
communion lords princes drive herds safely cumberland care whether one noble another king ear

heard glendower boldly attacked driven lord grey retainers estates taken 
rights matter nought say 
lord grey manages affairs welsh county denbighshire along north keep eastern border meddle affairs mine 
know glendower supporter king richard many tales current saying escaped pomfret still alive though doubt report died true 
know scotland man pleases albany put forward richard methinks device trouble king 
whether glendower believes man know certain would embrace opportunity prove hostility henry professes regard usurper 
whether account holding opinions foolishly giving expression lord grey thought fit seize estates know indeed care 
however man taken arms force dispossessed lord grey matter touches us responsible keeping peace welsh marches 
quarrel lord grey man would matter little hear exercises strange influence countrymen deem mysterious powers call spirits aid 
never known instance necromancy spirits availed way stout arms good armor assuredly opinion unlearned either country wales 
mountaineers altogether without learning full superstitions 
even us man learned commonalty deemed dabble black art may well reputation glendower obtained altogether due fact much knowledge whereas people none 
however may doubt welsh people mostly ignorant call glendower men parts hastening join banner 
even side border complaints welsh servants leaving openly due termination service making night without word warning

fortunately situated near sea could relieved without troops march places heavily armed man scarce make way active half clad welshmen harass night day without ever giving chance coming close quarters

perhaps sir john agreed 
crafty well bold man 
however well dunbar monk managed affair well 
think earl trusted say 
great scottish nobles deem well nigh king equal carry wars independent lords 
castle dunbar hands bitterest enemy douglas come small portion estates 
without aid england could hope recover interests therefore wholly bound 
tis strange two earls march different families names dunbar become vassal king make matter stranger 
however present mistakes arise seeing one able warrior mere boy 
future two earls march time court king mistakes might well made strange complications take place 
doubtless aware sir edmund nephew right birth king england 
know sprung duke clarence elder brother duke lancaster 
duke died without male issue rights fell edmund mortimer earl march husband daughter philippa 
marriage born roger mortimer lord lieutenant ireland part king richard reign killed wars country 
left two sons elder eight nine years old richard dethroned brother living windsor well treated king 
lord nephew attained age manhood deposition richard many would doubtless supported right throne child eight rule realm keep check turbulence great lords would absurd one even mentioned name henry course ascended throne right conquest 
heard something sir john percys among chief supporters henry fact one greater rights throne never talked alnwick although percy marriage sir edmund sister became uncle young earl march 
understand indeed sir edmund never intimate conversation us expressed opinion young earl would rights king england 
chapter breach duty 
two three hours return force ludlow sir edmund mortimer returned ridden almost without halt since received news welsh incursion 
knights met courtyard 
well friends hear sent welsh back fast came 
say sir edmund sir john wyncliffe replied 
sir john burgon went ninety horse coming upon party five six hundred killed half number put rest flight main body left free without urging 
tis pity hurried another twenty four hours four thousand men march besides first went 
done much damage scarce house left standing hills side llanidloes knighton 
gather must slain three four hundred least 
first total put much higher soon retired many fugitives made way knighton slipped away darkness villages attacked concealed woods among rocks 
fighting north sir edmund said 
got ruthyn found lord grey away talked matters knights 
left morning fifth day leaving night glendower men raided almost gates castle 
plans well laid midnight alarm given sentry walls 
everyone ran arms instant warder horn sounded reached top walls fires bursting twenty places 
long knights rode hundred fifty men arms welsh already gone 
seems laid ambuscade round every village signal given fell upon sleeping inhabitants put sword fired houses ten minutes first alarm made driving horses cattle sheep 
party rode hard fast came none 
party must gone way striking hills 
soon returned castle started four men arms lost time road especially rumor reached us welsh raid also 
sir john burgon give account doings party knight reported proceedings leaving ludlow concluded like story would run sir edmund bravery shown northern men young squire oswald captain alwyn 
furiously welsh assail us rear suffered heavily indeed even met grave disaster band covered rear charged forward fighting stoutly spot posted thickly covered dead 
found time look round made poor resistance advance 
never see stronger fighting 
questioned men 
say none fought bravely young oswald uncle gives warm praise 
lad however would lost life stout fellow stands half head comrades giant strength 
oswald told came repeated account incident 
quick thought throw fellow held horse though would availed much stout man arms hand 
still case could defended single handed five knaves though doubtless would given good account arms held 
alwyn said three times fray young esquire saved life cutting men attacking behind occupied opponents front 
make valiant knight day sir john 
sir henry percy would written strongly good reason feeling would discredit recommendation 
well sir knights merited thanks manner discharged duties absence 
course perfectly right wyncliffe remaining rate knights brought following country round 
important save knighton vastly prevent overspreading whole country might aught tell glendower object well haverstone bastow remained knighton 
broken fast ridden since midnight without stop breakfast talk plans pursued disguising fact welsh arms long heavy work us 
however matter serious us undertake king take hand 
raid punished counter raid glendower declared sovereign wales everything points fact men nation ready support matter touches majesty closely doubt soon finished war scots march hither head army 
however shall send summons tenants nephew estates herefordshire order hold readiness glendower venture invade us 
think 
knows counties bristle castles people could find refuge undertook besiege would speedily lose best part army 
none people experience war besiege strong place needs machines kinds glendower none likely construct 
besides marching would exposed attack garrisons castles sallying rear 
therefore think foolish enough undertake great enterprises though may make raids carry booty cattle done 
moreover keep vassals field longer feudal obligations compel stay unless pay feed might done readily enough two three months 
war may last years must reserve means strength till urgently needed 
lord grey doubtless opinion sure capture glendower consider enemy king personal foe 
however powerful think venture alone lead army welsh hills receives assistance king 
two days later news came king soon heard glendower proclamation sent orders lord grey lord talbot punish 
reach chester two days hence sir edmund said 
raid made would gladly take small share punishing rebel 
sir john burgon full share honor defeat day therefore send sir william bastow 
sir william take thirty best mounted men garrison together lord percy troop ride chester 
give letter lord talbot saying anxious aid punishment rebel raided marches sent haste fifty stout men aid striking blow possible effecting glendower capture harm king loyal subjects 
half hour later troop mounted 
oswald high spirits sir edmund spoken words telling service appointed 
sending troop sir william bastow said chiefly order may give another opportunity distinguishing also sure percy would glad men take part enterprise may honor credit 
lastly would party credit fighting day showed followers better understand warfare kind mine 
troop arrived chester second day leaving rested horses twenty four hours 
arrival earl talbot lord grey sir william bastow called inn put delivered letter sir edmund mortimer 
tis well done sir edmund earl talbot said although ruthyn lies beyond government marches defending command aiding lord grey presumptuous traitor 
gladly take clump spears among see small party lord percy men arms 
hear sir edmund men inflicted sharp blow upon welsh near knighton 
met messenger bearing report king came along gave particulars seems fight time hard one welshmen fought used much bravery 
lord 
party defeated left knighton aid defense welsh attack town sir john burgon commanded said village fought cared lives though made scarce defense fell upon retired disorder 
success gained attributes small degree percy little troop led captain stout soldier commands garrison alnwick young squire sir henry percy though lad fought extreme bravery 

sir henry places great trust wrote warmly concerning sir edmund mortimer 
going supper sir earl said 
hope join us 
pray tell young squire lodging may send would fain learn lips closer account fighting may utility us adventure 
oswald arrived supper brought introduced earl lord grey sir william bastow 
sit us young sir earl said kindly 
esquire hear good friend sir henry percy 
eat pray tell fight welsh 
sir edmund command hear 
lord away time ridden ruthyn hold council lord grey 
ah heard earl grey said 
arrived day welsh raid estate sir 
finding absent intended return home next morning matter delayed day rode knights punish marauders however made could overtaken 
see pray give thanks tell us happened 
sir william bastow better inform sir took place rode away knighton remained sir philip haverstone take command townspeople case welsh arrive strong aid come 
sir william related measures decided upon steps taken call levies brother knights ridden knighton intent hinder far possible welsh advance footmen could reach town followed shortly afterwards troops would come castles radnor 
oswald continued story gave account fight village manner welsh attacked retiring booty completely routed 
tactics nowise changed earl said since days griffith llewellyn 
direct charge unable stand attacked fury whenever opportunity fighting circumstances weight discipline gave us little advantage 
hear sir william bastow little band covered rear sir john burgon troop succeeded keeping bay broken resistance front carried small party villagers still defending 
lord 
men accustomed border warfare part entering percy service often engaged border forays taken soldiering homes burnt cattle driven scottish raiders 
therefore accustomed fight instead close order 
horses bred moors far active nimble heavier horses south enter heart soul fray kicking plunging striking forelegs approach assail riders 
thus able hold welsh carles bay far better men otherwise trained mounted would 
another thing border conflicts man accustomed keep eye neighbor sees hard pressed give aid 
therefore surprising men slew many welsh escaped cuts blows hatchets 
unhorsed sir william tells great peril 
come unhorsing sir rescue result said habit keeping eye neighbors 
welshman point attacking captain alwyn engaged two others front 
struck man welshman sprang horse behind pinned arms side four others rushed 
related thrown assailant horse saved roger 
good device quickly carried effect earl talbot said though well man arms next watching watched captain else must gone hard 
evident continue begun turn right valiant knight 
narrative useful see fall welsh necessary picked body men arms whose duty shall cover rear main attack seems real point danger 
come conflict assign body men arms percy men shall command fulfil duty 
would signal benefit us give another opportunity distinguishing winning spurs time comes 
thank greatly lord trust may bear merit approbation 
next morning force mounted daybreak 
consisted two hundred horse earl brought joined chirk hundred fifty lord grey men ruthyn orders already sent hold readiness 
done quietly without stir word would sure sent glendower known town preparations made expedition 
start castle ten clock night town would wrapped sleep would arrive chirk daybreak 
arriving castle found troops ruthyn duly come 
received seneschal william beauchamp lord abergavenny 
chirk castle passed many hands several times granted royal favorites fine building standing lofty eminence afforded view less seventeen counties 
square massive five flanking towers vast strength calculated defy utmost efforts welsh capture 
short distance thence valley dee estate glendower extending eight miles north neighborhood llangollen 
one detachments arrived daybreak two hours dark improbable advent noticed request knight commanded troop ruthyn gates castle kept closed day one allowed enter leave 
daybreak next morning whole force sallied 
three quarters hour later dashed valley point half mile distant glendower dwelling 
large stately building 
near stood guest house church appurtenances man high rank 
called sycharth 
glendower maintained almost princely hospitality addition estate possessed others south wales 
especially bards welcomed 
resided months others simply paused rambles country remained days received marked honor glendower well aware important services could render 
indeed relied small extent arouse feelings populace hospitality well repaid songs sung hall cottage praise prophecies destined restore ancient glories country 
house surrounded moat wall otherwise defensive works hundred years english welsh dwelt peaceably side side 
many castles indeed held welshmen garrisons considerable proportion welsh ranks 
singular glendower defiance king raids lately made continued dwell spot open attack within striking distance three great castles ruthyn chirk holt 
certain kept garrison would suffice offer stout defense strong band although precaution taken keeping watchman night day one turrets 
sound horn heard horsemen soon began descend hill 
pest knave lord grey exclaimed 
slip fingers yet 
scarce minute later mounted man seen dash full speed side building 
evidently well mounted although pursuit hotly kept two miles gained forest still quarter mile behind lost view although beat wood distance could find traces 
passing house detachment hundred men ordered surround suffer none enter leave 
return pursuing party house entered ransacked end end 
male retainers found ruthlessly killed 
furniture showed good taste wealth owner smashed pieces hangings torn whole place dismantled 
two female attendants found suffered earl talbot orders go free 
evidently ladies bower happen lord grey said hour later entered room one turrets already plundered soldiers 
tis pity find one two glendower daughters 
would invaluable hostages 
hasty talbot 
closely questioned men two women found means learn whether staying 
may even concealed secret hiding place hard 
called several men set search every room turret sign entrance secret chamber although walls tapped floors examined stone stone clue found entrance existed 
house built entirely stone offered facilities destroying fire 
doors hewn gates wall taken hinges thrown moat massive destroyed arms soldiers 
outlying buildings burned vineyard rooted water turned fish pond 
greatly vexed failure seize glendower two nobles rode back chirk leaving hundred men band ludlow formed part two earl talbot knights retain possession house decided whether levelled stone stone left standing go estate whomsoever king might assign 
lord grey advice sentries posted outside walls nightfall till daybreak prevent risk surprise glendower whose spies might take word main body assailants left 
one great halls left untouched serve use garrison abundance victuals found house cellar well stocked wines short time garrison made thoroughly comfortable 
soon became dark twenty men placed watch 
oswald party take third watch midnight mortimer men arms second 
captain band place men points might select 
alwyn talked matter nephew 
seems former said small chance anyone trying leave castle rate would scarcely wall splash moat would betray 
moreover love killing cold blood poor fellows stowed away somewhere willing enough let go free 
agree altogether alwyn oswald heard talk grey talbot concerning glendower daughters replied heartily 
would gladly saved men killed today 
one thing slay battle slaughter unresisting men goes altogether grain 
agreed oswald say best place greater portion men well away wall 
leave two gate set two others march round round moat 
say best plant others pairs quarter mile round house 
vastly important prevent glendower recapturing house surprise take prisoners two three fellows making escape 
agree alwyn 
accordingly filed gate four posted alwyn suggested 
rest disposed pairs circle distance round house 
keep watch roger oswald said 
tis time since opportunity talk 
take next post like 
wood comes closer house point patches behind enemy might creep 
eyes ears good roger lifts mighty voice tones alarm reach ears others signal run back gate top speed 
well oswald 
shall walk round ground see vigilant 
know glendower men lying 
may hap twenty miles away even would plenty time brought 
think much chance men surprised time used midnight rides across moor hill accustomed see dark crafty welshmen may think chance getting within hundred yards posts without seen especially moon still half full 
think chance disturbed master oswald roger said took post low stunted tree 
think 
glendower spies told main body surprised morning returned chirk may sure enough left hold place successfully wild followers till assistance reach us would nothing gain recapturing house could hold long force assembled chirk 
besides must know well enough fight successfully must woods 
whether studied black art little doubt turned attention greatly military matters foe despised 
playing deep game give us deal trouble unless greatly mistaken done 
hear sorts strange stories powers master oswald 
yes see roger spirits say serve much use would warned coming talbot taken unawares morning 
true enough roger said tone relief 
part greatly alarmed spirits 
good abbot used threaten carried unless mended ways always slept soundly enough never saw aught frighten 
used say spirits dead monks used walk convent garden though cell looked upon often stood hour never see anything frighten 
welsh come master fight means roger 
duty watch fight 
must lift voice shout loud must run gate 
make fight till rest join us 
whatever shout tell 
false alarm would raise whole garrison naught came would make us laughing stock 
talking keeping close lookout ground front also right left watches two hundred yards apart make sure party enemy slipped unseen 
suddenly roger plucked oswald sleeve said whisper unless eyes deceive master saw two dark figures flit clump bushes forty yards away next 
go see roger 
may spies crept close 
let us give chase 
shall shout master 
attack 
stoop low look back see great figure like hares 
run softly 
stooping low set run certain figures making straight forest pause get another glimpse ran straight 
gone seventy eighty yards heard stifled exclamation without attempt concealment two figures rose bush twenty yards ahead fled forest 
occasion stooping top speed oswald roger pursued fugitives 
ran fast oswald outpaced heavier companion came within fifty yards edge forest passing drew sword faced 
surrender said cut 
instead fierce spring anticipated two figures stopped suddenly exchanged word welsh dropped cloaks 
oswald astonishment two young women stood 
evidently belonged upper class 
richly dressed 
wore heavy gold chains round necks bracelets metal set oswald noticed reflection moon jewels 
also brooches girdles held massive gold clasps 
time roger come stood staring astonishment 
take good fellows girl said english began unfasten necklace 
take let us go 
make rich 
esquire sir henry percy oswald said rob women 
appearance judge daughters glendower 
would useless deny one girls said proudly 
come spying oswald said 
surely among father warriors others better suited work might found 
spying girl replied 
lain hidden day making escape 
madam guard round castle know none escaped 
esquire gentleman sir disclose tell though indeed father house hands boots much whether secret known 
secret passage castle opens bushes issued hiding day secret chamber leads 
well sir prisoners shall suppose sent london held father usurper hands believe years yet 
oswald silent 
two girls seventeen eighteen years age possessed singular beauty inherited father bore air fearlessness admiration 
still lad thinking years fair girls might pass prison felt deep pity 
drew roger aside 
think roger must send fair young girls prison faith know master 
shut many time cell sort fellow feeling prisoners indeed two fairer maidens never seen 
orders look welshmen see attack us 
word said welsh women 
besides running away thinking attacking us 
well roger deceive 
doubt duty take two maidens prisoners heart aches thought might pass years lives prison 
responsible father misdeeds ambition may restored glendower may induced treat fall hands mercifully 
none know one need ever know 
risk anyhow said short pause 
know duty letting go ever known lose chance advancement indeed lose life 
however need never known conscience would sorely trouble whenever thought shut one king henry prisons 
turned girls 
think ladies asked king hands father would make terms submit certainly one spoken said 
children sons daughters would dream abandoning rights betraying country obtain liberty two us 
case imprisonment would degree stop war bring renewal peace two countries certainly us would strangle prison think thought us would turn father noble purpose 
case oswald said quietly clear captivity would nought bring peace allay troubles begun 
therefore take let go though may failing somewhat duty 
promise future use influence may possess father obtain kind treatment prisoners may fall hands 
expression haughty defiance hitherto worn faded girls faces 
shall never forget kindness sir one said low voice 
thank hearts much sake father cruelly ill used 
much trouble although know captivity would turn purpose could greatly grieve trouble already troubles enough shoulders 
accept one jewels token gratitude kindness shown night us thanks lady gift take 
failing duty least shall said received aught 
least girl began turning roger 
lady man arms said 
neither knight esquire simple soldier take presents saving two maidens capture captivity 
monk life though man arms 
never opportunity aught kindness woman glad chance fallen way 
may ask name one done us kindness girl said turning oswald 
best lady 
service might cost head bruited 
tis best even know 
doubt would preserve secret would perhaps mention father best known none 
girls silent minute 
sir elder said exchanging word two sister would ask boon 
successes war always one side 
sister think often one greatly befriended us accident war fall welsh hands evil befall would deep grief us 
pray sir accept little gold necklet 
value small indeed given child father 
name engraved clasp 
time stress send father right sure recognizing would treat dear friends done much daughters 
pray accept wear always round neck wrist never prove useful least recall us thoughts 
churlish lady refuse token offered though hope needful use say indeed expect return shortly lord northumberland pleasant remembrance service good fortune enabled render two fair maidens 
assured shall ever keep necklet sake givers 
farewell must back post captain guard going round might missed 
shall never forget sir 
may blessing god fall kind deed may good fortune attend oswald answered roger made way back post girls hurried entered forest 
chapter bad news 
strange adventure roger 
strange one master 
lord grey would tear hair knew two pretty birds hiding cage day never knew 
however see us harm 
nay probability may even benefit us happen ill fortune ever fall hands welsh abstain cutting throats perchance young ladies would repay service rendered taking us protection 
may indeed roger though hope shall never hear tonight adventure 
may reason doubt although instructions touching capture women failed duty 
way trouble master oswald 
monk failed duty scores times whit worse rather better indeed since owing failures free man arms instead mewed life convent 
shall sleep one wink less saved two prettiest girls ever saw shut years prison 
afraid sense duty strong roger 
afraid master saving matter duty face enemy 
mean roger duty pleases otherwise 
expect way good many us roger laughed 
wonder whether lord grey idea glendower daughters house arrived know remember men searching time signs secret passages 
whether idea glendower daughters might hidden away know 
truly might roger said saw among spoil carried others rode chirk silks stuffs looked like feminine garments 
somebody coming across next post broke 
doubtless captain 
would tell done certainly roger 
uncle old soldier though would sake say anything think would approve done 
tis best rate keep entirely 
quiet elsewhere alwyn asked came 
quiet uncle 
tis well although methinks could hold place welshmen could hardly hope posts would cut could reach house 
well keep watch think feel glendower scarce attack us 
could hold place gain might well turned place would destroyed seeing would need two three hundred men shut garrison 
waiting half hour alwyn made round posts went rouse party relieve 
soon issued sentries called stretched three hours sleep 
day dawned messenger rode chirk bearing earl talbot orders evacuation house could advantage retaining empty glendower might return afford another opportunity capturing 
following day party broke 
lord grey rode men ruthyn forty men arms ludlow returned town days later news arrived glendower large following established rugged height corwen engaged strengthening ancient fortifications summit 
time quiet border came startling news glendower suddenly surprised plundered burnt ground town ruthyn fair held time 
obtained great booty greatly injured enemy lord grey retired 
evident local force sufficient strength could found pursue glendower fastnesses ranges berwyn snowdon nothing done three months later king return scotland marched wales levies warwickshire leicestershire eight adjacent counties orders issued people shrewsbury towns eastern border hold readiness repel movement welsh direction 
king however accomplished nothing 
glendower following took refuge among forests snowdon english army marched along north coast putting sword bands peasantry ventured oppose crossed isle anglesey entering franciscan monastery llanfaes slew monks carried rest england established community english monks convent 
done franciscans supporters late king believed given aid encouragement glendower 
welsh expedition therefore successful scotch 
time matters settled 
glendower occupied strengthening position 
much reputation spread large numbers welshmen settled england sold property gave positions abandoned careers made way across border join 
still months operations undertaken either side week return king forces sir edmund mortimer said oswald longer keep following lord side 
largely strengthened garrison twenty men however valiant longer importance 
know asked percy aid thought perchance might come bringing two three hundred men sister might accompanied 
maybe matters go quietly northern marches may able yet fear scotch take advantage troubles may aught know entered communication glendower may together harass kingdom 
written several times telling good service men rendered would five hundred good fighters case would undertake single handed bring fellow reason 
written letter hand deliver saying present things quiet glendower hiding among mountains sent back without hope greater events take place come hither give benefit knowledge border warfare even comes accompanied sister dozen spears 
may tell two months since wrote saying glad captain garrison alnwick back wrote saying king wales would hold seeing glendower might make great foray king hunting north soon left army would send home 
alwyn men well pleased heard return since raid glendower house life dull one even fact receiving pay sir edmund well percy insufficient reconcile light hearts started following morning north arriving alnwick ten days leaving 
sir hotspur came courtyard rode castle 
welcome back oswald trusty alwyn thank men manner borne shown men west stoutly northumbrians hold day battle 
glad indeed find went returned home bearing scars indeed none disabled

nearly year since party left alnwick oswald time greatly increased height strength 
eighteen nearly six feet height figure filled greatly since left home might well passed three four years older real age 
evening alwyn gave full account fray welsh 
men fight stoutly alwyn percy said concluded story 
right stoutly sir henry discipline equal bravery would formidable opponents indeed quite unable stand men arms set battle 
respect means equal scotch surprises irregular fighting could wish see better men 
unfortunate affair percy said

london many places settled among us 
numbers studied universities shropshire radnor flint border counties heard laboring men welsh come speak language indeed form small portion garrisons castles much fear welsh really ravage border counties tis like castles fall hands treachery fellow countrymen garrisons 
sir edmund speaks highly oswald behavior fight reported sir james burgon knight well fitted judge matters inmate castle

present things somewhat quiet well like uncle take holiday time visit father mother 
sent several times news 
next morning oswald mounted rode attended roger asked oswald take relations cared visit 
alwyn going days indeed would probably declined take holiday oswald earnestly begged go

turbulent times hand border wales maybe france 
may get killed father house may harried bairds may succeed getting scatheless last time blame afterwards seen shaken hand opportunity present 
oswald seen much two years passed since first left hold rode towards seemed strange everything going day ridden away difference hold looked strangely small little account many strong castles seen

oswald scoured country sometimes returning late afternoon often staying night houses one oswald friends 
crossed border rode armstrongs stopped couple days bringing allan janet back roxburgh still held english unless hostilities actively going people border save marauders always ready seize opportunity offered carrying booty friendly terms maintained frequent intercourse 
alwyn returned alnwick leave

half hour later roger oswald mounted

sigh roger flung saddle 
horse ridden strong shaggy pony

staff well roger 
man would need hard skull indeed require one blow weapon 
adam armstrong done went cottage allan lay 
paid several visits afternoon nought comfort gained white face insensible lad 
meg assured however going well could expected 
torpor present said may lie two three days long fever hope know opens eyes 
nought keep wet cloths round head put fresh poultice wound every hour 
armstrong took place son pallet 
time work making preparations oswald departure sending messages friends prevented thoughts dwelling upon loss 
throughout night picture home left rode morning thought empty shell wife dead daughters carried son lying life death came full force well nigh broke 
meantime little party making across hills morning came upon northern road fifteen miles bairds hold 
oswald roger dismounted 
arranged men return horses hills rest late afternoon mount ride parton

one came along return lodging 
feel stiff legs master roger said fifty mile ride hills joke hard day work

feel stiff though pretty well accustomed horse exercise 
however present hold dusty footsore shall look characters thoroughly 
neither sorry arrived small village quarter mile bairds hold 
went together little ale house vigorously attacked rough fare set 
hast thou traveled far host asked watched eating 
indifferently far monk said tis five twenty miles hence moffat would seemed farther good fellow overtaken fell pace 
good company though monkish gowns little common steel pot broadsword talk songs lightened way 
whither going father making way carlisle said 
brother prior small monastery long since seen 
lives stronghold saw hills short distance away hold william baird head family doubtless may heard 
heard name noted raider across border monk said fierce man bold one 
regard church would gladly take abode day two truth wearied years since feet carried long journey 
say nothing host said 
would depend humor whether took shut gates face without ceremony methinks present latter likely former hold full armed men say wisest leave alone even bare moor sleep upon 
nevertheless try monk said 
may one good tempers spoke 
suppose also priest fortalice ay bairds would rather talk 
near neighbors among best customers 
spoke four armed men came door 
good day wilson ill assorted couple surely 
monk though somewhat rough one man arms 
fellow travellers day roger said calmly 
met road love solitude enough spare accosted 
turned good companion 
man sinew monk methinks would made better soldier shaveling 
thought sometime monk said parents thought otherwise late take another vocation 
staff soldier asked taking handling 
yes son 
days even quiet religious man like may meet rough fellows way staff gives support feet aid command decent behavior fall 
much lose sufficient buy victuals journey carlisle told host journeying see brother prior convent 
fellow fall overtook twenty miles north road glasgow 
traveling carlisle man said oswald 
nay said purpose going beyond border 
lost employment tried vain find another much liking 
come south seek service one welcome strong arm wield sword 
hast tried douglas said douglas men enough methinks care mewed one castles 
enough already seeing man arms george dunbar till turned traitor went english 
look likely fellow know pay men fighting us 
tis well great nobles like dunbar douglas keep men always arms ready ride moment notice carry fire sword 
war business save trouble air mayhap run short cattle horses go fetch across border 
true always score two us somehow bairds enemies followers house live holdings raise cattle mountain sheep grow oats live best 
would rather live others oswald said 
used live hut moors would way fancy get place comrades talk crack joke would rather cross seas take service irish chieftain travel wales hear men say fighting 
need go far fighting want man said 
ride bairds share 
like stop day two take opportunity talk william baird one sons find chance take 
best times fond visitors would less usual 
armed men come conversation going 
attention paid travellers 
others sitting table across room talked among 
care work one said presently raising voice higher pitch others spoken 
across border ready work another comes scot scot like 
man another said qualms scot always fighting scot ay far back one ever heard 
take much douglas dunbar get loggerheads wild clans north always fighting among 
yes well said reason neighbors quarrel would rather summoned friends met fair fight one pounce upon expected slay burn unopposed 
ay ay two three others men agreed 
doubtless better scot scot 
tis border fashion another put 
law border fight fashion 
today turn tomorrow may someone else follow chiefs northern clansmen whether musgrave baird fenwick armstrong chief hold cares neither king earl fights quarrel may please 
one william baird men quarrel mine whether ride king scotland king england douglas percy armstrong musgrave matters value stoup ale 
nigel say 
methinks one may preference one sort fighting another would rather fight matter man man fall suddenly hold none ready encounter us 
roger pause conversation table got seat stretched 
well friend said oswald go see make welcome hold 
may see 
shall return sleep 
therefore bid good day hope may find service suit 
benedicite paying refreshment roger took staff corner went 
hearty fellow stalwart one man spoken said 
care crack crown staff 
met coming north comrade yes twenty miles away 
near moffat overtook 
would rather drink fight 
seldom seen stronger looking man 
opinion comrade monks bad fighters either 
bishops led monks battle proved stout men arms 
others gone oswald strolled village mounted eminence whence could take view across valley hilltops northeast 
one two miles away could make man standing horse 
watched little time beyond taking steps backwards forwards man move 
lookout said doubt watching road kelso jedburgh 
baird hardly think armstrongs soon gathered force sufficient attack may thought well place one men watch 
wonder roger getting think must taken would back 
roger walked quietly hill bairds hold perched 
man stepped forward gate neared 
none enter said without permission master 
tell poor monk order saint benedict way convent dunbar one near carlisle brother prior prays hospitality day two seeing worn long travel sentry spoke man behind latter took message william baird 
latter good humor 
taken part raid armstrongs led thomas baird cousin fact latter entirely successful burned armstrong house brought back daughters given greatest satisfaction 
long standing feud two families fact armstrongs good terms english neighbors still one married sister law forster yardhope greatly embittered feeling side 
long meditated striking blow present time exceptionally favourable 
douglas hands full 
ill terms rothesay whose conduct daughter deeply offended 
newly acquired land earl march gave much trouble 
jealous great influence albany court moreover making preparations serious raid england 
likely would pay attention complaints armstrongs might make attack upon especially aid small use bairds could moment join invasion across border three hundred good fighting men 
william baird yet even considered captives 
might give marriage younger men family might hold hostages 
injuring personally think 
slaughter raid lightly regarded ill treat female prisoners would arouse general feeling dissatisfaction along border 
reprisals might made armstrongs friends case would widespread reprobation excited william baird reckless could hardly afford despise 
therefore roger request brought said take father kenelm 
tell look monk comfort 
evening bring hall question journey 
roger followed man courtyard 
paid apparently attention going quick glance enabled perceive hold full men 
followed guide winding stair turret wall lower story inhabited priest 
soldier knocked door opened priest gave baird message 
tall man spare bony 
baird report said youth ridden many foray england 
fighting men common family thought well one enter church always good friend could represent complaint made explain matters show family wise blame 
moreover necessary priest chief fortalice family best one would strict penances could conveniently silent doings within walls 
priest accepted role unwillingly 
ambitious man saw one fighting bairds small opportunity rising aught beyond command one holds 
douglas regarded friendly eye breaches truces brought upon constant complaints english wardens might day lead force punish family one exempted general pardon last truce 
priest would better opportunities bairds much influence along border might day exert favor 
far opportunity occurred 
disappointment henry last invasion kept along eastern coast hoped war assuredly would ere long break violently would give chance longed might sent uncle douglas offers service might even go north interview albany 
fairly away liddesdale resolved would long time indeed returned 
thirty years age hard keen face 
well brother said often order sojourn 
glad one converse matters arms armor forays wars 
matters indeed much men mouths roger said though degree interested choice vocation would rather man arms monk 
wonder said seeing nature bountiful matter height strength doubt could case need use staff carry good effect 
methinks might happily none molested way seeing perhaps wallet likely full one mayhap hardly worthwhile meddle small prospect plunder 
come sit priest said 
uncle consigned care 
shall sup half hour 
shall sorry roger replied though broke fast black bread small beer village tis poor nourishment man traveled far large frame support 
come roger repeated story 
would shorter traveled berwick brother 
difference great roger replied carry message edinburgh shorter keep west pentlands come lanark thence moffat 
yes suppose short 
trouble way roger shook head 
generally join traveller makes journey pass quicker 
came today stout young fellow overtook side moffat 
somewhat elbow looked askance first turned blithe companion got well together 
could troll good song voice wanting power 
curious also dunbar though immediately would seem wandered time lookout service 
cattle drover man arms george dunbar least understood earl fled douglas took possession dunbar lost living 
told made way hopes finding employment border blows common good blade use farther north 
said might found employment albany great lord said seen earl march fugitive cared enter service another noble might turn ousted place lose life albany thought heard would rather serve master 
said rothesay would king scotland laughed lightly said rothesay managed get upon ill friendship earl march douglas heard albany thought chances becoming king scotland worth considering 
must bold varlet thus speak irreverently great ones 
think bold roger said merry thoughtless young fellow company mine let tongue loose said first came head 
matter methought spoke without warrant 
came north know whence came last think edinburgh taken service english king sat know nought came siege 
moment horn blew 
supper priest said 
go 
meal laid hall however large enough contain ordinary retainers hold 
men come summons baird provided courtyard table occupied entirely members baird family others always acted 
yet taken seats priest entered companion took sir william baird 
saint andrew monk seen finer figure many day 
pity monk gown clothe limbs 
always mine opinion roger said heartiness raised smile hard faces men standing round 
look carried arms 
wild youth roger said thought ever donning monk hood grievously wounded foray northumberland reached home lauder well nigh died fever wound swore life saved would become monk 
got well kept vow methinks known dull life would rather died fever 
story perfectly true save name birthplace roger spoke heartily one doubted story 
monastery dunbar dunbar rotherglen 
ask convent stood 
roger stayed oswald dunbar able answer questions satisfactorily 
party took places table priest roger sitting bottom 
conversation upper end naturally turned foray general disbelief expressed chance armstrongs retaliating 
tis question one bairds said could raise fifty men 
doubtless send complaint douglas hands well full likely quarrel us trifle may want aid moment either albany english 
intend girls settled yet william baird said shortly 
rate present shall hold hostages 
think anything likely come affair hear force approaching likely give us trouble could send word arrow loosened walls hang girls marks archers 
fancy send trooping 
soon meal carousal began priest rose accompanied roger retired chamber

roger entered priest 
well monk baird said going try mettle companion yesterday 
answer mettle roger said fights well talks discredit 
took places facing lookers men well qualified judge strength sinew murmured would difficult find better matched pair 
height stood lightly feet figures seemed full life activity 
smiling robert baird smile confidence assurance skill oswald face expressed good temper others took belief would rate able make defense would assure taken bairds service 
first rally indeed proved 
robert baird taken offensive showered blows heavily springing backwards forwards wonderful quickness activity oswald blade ever met give way inch even baird fiercely attacked 
suddenly adopted tactics opponent pressed hotly several times obliged give ground 
oswald could twice got heavy blow abstained 
could see antagonist favorite among kinsmen felt discomfit would excite feeling hostility 
panting exertions drew step backwards lowered swords 
enough william baird said matter need pushed 
tis long since seen good bout swordplay 
young fellow learned business respects well make good recruit indeed 
say lad join us month till see whether like service judge service suit us time living drink money 
agree either retainer give holding moor build shelter give horse next foray clump cattle

accustomed long marching 
real meaning question arranged found prisoners kept answer meant yes difficult get 
evening indeed returned priest chamber broached bottle together 
priest part asked many questions state things edinburgh dunbar opinions people regard duke albany prince would probably come coldness said exist

oswald put finger lips stop saying aught jane armstrong death 
dismounting whispered mother ear time speak girls yet knew nought mother death left break 
since scouring country father went try get friends take matter truth willing 
know slight enterprise attack bairds stronghold 
fared badly last time went though blow retreat know bairds hold taken like country tower 
tis greatly bigger stronger scarce attempted save royal army especially whole countryside would swarming round us hours crossed border 
time quarrel people say risk would indeed great loss heavy 
sent messenger morning armstrong tell feared could raise sixty spears would ride hiniltie join force could collect try surprise bairds hold rescue girls though seemed mighty dangerous enterprise 
learned yesterday morning father carried

slept tynedale last night 
manage unless roger flew bairds hold carried backs see could managed 
place strong even douglases cared carry terms treaty arrest william baird notorious breaker truce two countries

affair turned easy enough

henceforth maintain might things way tend soften man contrary way sharpen wits enable carry matters plans contrivances would scarce conceived men advantage

well oswald doubtless mother break easily could done 
women better things men given speak bluntly straight told 
chapter another mission ludlow 
oswald talking father roger taken four horses round long shed ran along one side wall telling moss troopers story oswald relating father joined 
well friend roger john forster said came shaking heartily hand faith son fortunate stout fellow henchman 
tis rather fortunate master roger replied 
strike bids need think brain bears proportion bulk indeed even matter strength bids fair equal seems grow taller stronger every month surprising seeing much beyond common 
matter credit due save faithfully could carried orders 
men try carry orders roger intelligence 
doubtless something book learning instructor 
think way master forster roger replied quickly liked thought gained advantage whatever stay convent 
might likely useful man small stature whose thoughts would naturally turn scribe making living finicking ways instead bearing man one like tis time thrown away 
yet say may useful master oswald day knight go court occasion write letters scribe hand good downright blow advantage man strikes book learning get 
done well enough without roger think must use else oswald good devising plans place heard news harrying hiniltie carrying armstrong daughters never thought starting adventure 
may may improve mind master forster wielding mace strengthens muscles arm 
speak experience far see hours spent matters good wasted 
nay roger oswald amused listener conversation broke evidence lately 
able read priest missal would seen monk fact much better fluently could read strange manuscript confirmation story enabled us rescue cousins probably saved skin say nothing mine baird learned deceiving would likely hung us gateway hold spies 
roger scratched head embarrassment 
gainsay master oswald though think certainly proof time spent learning thrown away say able read missal doubtless would gone hard us 
ashamed wrong 
would english honest 
reading certainly came mightily useful 
must also remember roger oswald said smile read wrote better monks abbot would picked instructor asked come scotland sir henry percy would never begged abbot allow go forth world 
say master oswald never say word reading writing see excellent things never entered thick head greatly benefited acquiring maintain say contrary great value way tend soften man prove person also 
moment mary forster appeared top steps 
supper ready said 
broken news girls 
quite broken hearted poor things sent bed 
suppose leaving us tomorrow morning oswald shall daybreak next day 
must stay longer ought back three days ago sir henry wondering befallen 
talking matter evening best done girls mary forster said expressed great anxiety get back soon could order might try comfort father nurse allan john forster said would ride four men hiniltie day two 
next evening however knock outside gate opened adam armstrong entered

man arrived safely yesterday morning great difficulty made way unobserved bairds fifty sixty men scattered hills 
go wife tell father arrived 
terribly upset john went wife left room 
told loss mother arrived yesterday 
oswald thought would need strength journey better mary break news got 
felt sorely adam since messenger brought news 
armstrong pressed hand silently 
good wife john right good wife 
buried seemed remains yesterday morning 
kept starting moment man came news oswald got girls hands bairds 
allan trust get right 
come partly senses though still dazed 
carried litter monastery obtained monk robe man feared leave village lest bairds furious escape girls might return finish work 
speak oswald door opened girls ran time adam armstrong turned 
lad said think long time coming point think lightly service rendered 
ah lad could scarce believe ears fergus told henchman got lasses bairds hands gone horseback 
put question whether sure really girls 
seemed altogether impossible believe last though came could tell 
time talking oswald said 
every moment importance 
matter simple enough worth words telling 
related manner roger obtained entrance hold succeeded getting girls away 
sounds simple enough telling armstrong said needed stout hearts good nerves enter bairds den errand 
carried lives hands well must borne story passed without suspicion 
well thought indeed well carried would done credit boldest craftiest leader border 
say john proud adam 
never thought plan 
matter hand might taken twenty stout fellows tried scale walls unseen fall upon spear sword confusion carry girls would desperate plan small hope success 
small indeed john small indeed armstrong said shaking head 
prisoners hold bairds likely caught sleeping accustomed surprises whole garrison would afoot minute man ye would lived tell story 
mad thought passed brain first heard news long 
even spears others might gather friends tweeddale small chance capturing bairds hold 
annandale nithsdale us could done

fact one way way oswald hit upon 
well lad fear shall never opportunity repaying debt owe armstrong border side half english half scotch hold among closest kin give welcome aid whensoever may need 
man roger call oswald said stepping door shouted follower came one outhouses occupied retainers hold 
come roger oswald said master armstrong wishes see 
roger came entered adam grasped hand 
whenever time fighting brave fellow remember home hiniltie long armstrong dwells 
thought fetched monk gown nephew oswald might able gather news let know possibly girls faring little think alone unaided would rescue hands bairds 
merry business master armstrong pleased hugely save went heart bald patch head hair well grown covered well nigh good fighting trick bairds hold thought mightily sure harmless brother monastery 
rest easy business scarce worth talking 
done easily done well roger 
well planned well carried 
nought planning carrying simple enough 
tested knowledge dunbar monastery came tested knowledge reading 
assured story true paid attention believing stay day two rest way south 
occasion however use heavy staff carried 
slight occasion would chance used heads bairds 
little master armstrong daughters thanked prettily enough therefore pray thee say 
son going well meg margetson monks whose hands put say hope danger 
next morning oswald roger mounted soon daybreak rode alnwick 
night arranged girls present remain yardhope hold hiniltie repaired put state stronger defense 
agreed well word said armstrong return whereabouts daughters bairds might anger make attack yardhope whereas present could reason whatever suspecting obtained news father hiniltie would suppose lodged family elsewhere perhaps placed safety jedburgh 
wondered become hotspur said oswald entered apartments report return 
expected two three days since indeed wanted business 
sorry lord fulfilled orders gave governors roxburgh jedburgh became engaged affair uncle adam armstrong pressing character deemed would excuse heard nature 
briefly related occupied since leaving jedburgh 
tis good excuse indeed hotspur said must tell evening earl wife also hear 
business spoke consequence carry message earl westmoreland 
sent another hand 
winter passed quietly 
oswald work light 
rode home days paid visit hiniltie 
number men work 
exterior walls way suffered shell central building far resisted fire necessary rebuild 
roof floors replaced defences considerably strengthened 
portcullis placed door case outer wall carried gate forced could lowered 
projecting battlement thrown openings boiling lead pitch could poured enemy trying break 
flanking turrets archers built corner house exterior walls strengthened towers center face either side gateway 
shall safe think oswald said allan almost recovered 
place hardly taken sudden attack even forces bairds could bring could get help jedburgh long could gain even outside wall 
father going fortnight fetch girls 
rode week two since found looking well happy people course anxious get back especially seldom home 
fix day go try meet 
suppose soon spring sets fairly shall troubles certainly well janet jessie home begin although yardhope strong enough resist attack bairds border rangers scarcely hold regular invasion 
four days return alnwick oswald sent percy 
scots seem moving yet latter said glendower ever increasing strength boldness 
received startling news morning 
party welshmen seen near ruthyn earl grey body mounted men rode 
retired briskly pursuing fell ambush captured 
twould thought glendower would put chief enemy death said holds earl ransom 
glendower plenty men doubt needs money sorely 
draw revenue estates denbigh south wales suffice expenses feeding body men always arms 
doubtless ask great sum tis like get 
grey favorite king latter doubtless aid needs services hold flint denbighshire welsh 
moreover methinks king would another reason make every effort buy lord grey freedom secret great love mortimer although holds young earl march prisoner windsor forget lad rightful heir throne friends richard would place opportunity 
mortimer boy uncle estates guardian young earl wide possessions hereford shropshire powerful noble 
king real reason doubting know mortimer thought supporting earl march claim throne held rest kingdom henry wise politic far fitter ruler lad could 
doubtless henry well aware sees young earl grows manhood might become dangerous might supplant supplanted richard 
thus doubt king use every effort obtain release lord grey order may act counterpoise welsh marches influence mortimer 
however question 
evident daring deed glendower busy year success first attempt assuredly add following 
therefore scots present quiet would ride ludlow sojourn 
sir edmund sends scant news would fain know closely matters going great insurrection like grow 
may well scots seeing powerful glendower becoming enter agreement invades west country shall pour across border forces case hard pressed king power south might fully engaged welsh battle whole strength scotland alone 
therefore write length giving full reports talk country bearing welsh beyond border settled west counties 
course take fighting monk aid matter good scholar though bad monk weary holding pen dictate matter 
send two well mounted couriers relays horses placed road despatch letter week also course carry letters sir edmund mortimer may wish send 
well sir henry 
shall start today nay matter urgent 
ride tomorrow morning 
good 
well pleased oswald 
affair rescued cousins showed discretion ability well skill courage see knowledge gained monastery coming useful 
mark approbation order one warhorses shall saddled readiness morning 
steed mortimer gave good one need another one may fall lame killed wounded tis well second string bow 
moreover riding service tis meet provide horseflesh 
marked horse today one rode came truth outgrown altogether though doubt sturdy little beast would even yet carry long day journey tis scarce accordance position representative 
oswald thanked hotspur heartily gift felt needed second charger reluctant ask father money required buy one expenses repairing hold last scotch invasion heavy gold scarce commodity yardhope 
started daybreak next morning riding fine horse hotspur given 
roger rode behind followed two lightly armed men act messengers 
one led oswald second horse 
soon left castle oswald called roger side 
well roger dare say pleased move 
tis nigh five months since returned ludlow save adventure bairds quiet time since 
think work welsh master think indeed roger 
say glendower forces greatly increasing captured lord grey holds ransom 
king must regret parliament refused listen glendower complaints one richard men perhaps spoken hotly prudent touching king murder 
say richard still alive scots 
may say roger think likely king figure well known hundreds men 
show even scotland many nobles truces kingdoms london known king richard man would recognized 
besides think king richard caged pomfret chance getting free may suit albany present set puppet order cause uneasiness henry render richard friends unwilling obey orders king take field scots richard tis scotland would shown france would gladly received anne bohemia husband would aid support urge claims 
well master care takes us wales 
rate glad journey thither seems present chance giving taking hard knocks 
take party men arms last time mortimer plenty men without handful percy spare would little use 
going principally hotspur anxious kept well informed happens west feels sure glendower power increases needful send strong english army 
scots make great invasion behove northern counties lords hold readiness 
traveled fast five days leaving alnwick arrived ludlow 
welcome back master oswald sir edmund said arrived 
thought maybe sir henry percy would send hither 
matters becoming serious tis said scotch emissaries glendower though truth answer percy certainly wish know well passes west poor hand pen moreover much busied write often 
knows right well doubt instructed inform passes 
right sir edmund 
purpose sent hither charging write frequently situation power glendower must needs increase since nought done bring reason 
also commands place service obey respects squire 
shall glad ride knights sir edmund replied courteously 
forgotten good service last year trust may find opportunity winning spurs 
shall glad indeed sir edmund 
may ask glendower supposed present headquarters summit plinlimmon great hill borders montgomery thence ravages plunders country round slaying supposed attached english cause 
unfortunately meets little resistance castles part suffered get bad state since hundred years seemed would longer required welsh appeared become peaceful people counties 
many knights built convenient houses let castles become almost ruins 
garrisons garrisons kept part composed welshmen 
longer trusted easy matter obtain englishmen places great terror caused slaughter glendower fall hands even adventurous spirit would present care leave homes beyond severn take desperate service 
glendower movements rapid notice coming band suddenly appear burning slaughtering know approach 
surely must difficult victual large force summit mountain would assuredly keeps hundred fifty chosen men 
beacon fires lighted would hours ten thousand men mountain 
whole population start five hundred men news would reach means smokes hills marched five miles away 
tis warfare credit gained much loss sustained see anything less army large enough march wales end end burning towns villages putting sword resist affair brought end 
thus harold brought wales reason strongly two generations ere ventured cross border 
edward finally stamped rebellions methinks work done manner 
far good king invasion last autumn encouraged though numerous army effected nothing showed welsh powerless troops enter mountains take offensive anywhere save level ground 
oswald life ludlow differed way alnwick 
took meals high table sitting knights sir edmund squires 
practiced arms tilted courtyard castle occasionally rode hunting hawking party knights ladies helped drill bodies tenants hundred time came swell garrison 
sometimes carried mortimer orders governors castles rode strong party hereford radnor 
short time arrival montgomery taken storm glendower englishmen welshmen suspected friendship english slain 
shortly afterwards suburbs welshpool burnt great loss earl powys whose annoyance greater since tenants arms glendower 
following hard upon pieces bad news came word fallen upon abbey cwmhir six miles rhayader radnorshire entirely destroyed 
news caused great indignation reason sacrilegious act warmly discussed castle 
reason methinks sir edmund said listened knights time twofold 
first place ecclesiastics part monks orders save franciscans favored king henry richard chief reason long animosity church bards glendower great patron done great service stirring people songs 
bards ever foremost instigating insurrections wales 
edward first attempted suppress altogether edict executing martial law still unrepealed dare venture show castle town held us 
man rallied round glendower 
house always open even distinguished welsh name meaning protector bards 
hunted fugitives many years doubt used influence stir religious houses 
heavier blow still struck glendower feeling ludlow nothing short consternation fugitive arrived town new radnor saying strong castle carried assault garrison three score men beheaded town laid ashes 
heaviest blow yet struck glendower 
castle great strength town walled lords marches 
place carried welsh kerns seemed well nigh incredible execution whole garrison aroused lively indignation 
war knife indeed sir edmund mortimer said yet abhorrent wholesale murder garrison politic step part glendower 
news spread throughout wales strong place new radnor could defend lesser castles hope indeed garrisons care man walls since resistance means death 
doubtless many welsh among men murdered may sure compatriots castles hasten desert join glendower 
indeed proved case garrisons castles dwindled away hold hold fell without resistance 
even ludlow every precaution taken welshmen expelled town garrison also purged although men arms served many years 
men told troubles taken service chose present state things one traitor might endanger safety castle town impossible tell true men corrupted glendower agents necessary suffer even innocent 
among tenants mortimer estate young earl many welsh 
measures taken 
fathers sometimes indeed three generations lived peaceably rendered military service required troubles england mortimer reluctant treat harshly especially declared readiness serve prove devotion english lord 
sufficiently numerous said source danger 
glendower invade england great force doubtless would join save lives families one four five english tenants see source danger us 
chapter letter king 
large number flemings settled wales left country consequence constant troubles many set cloth mills welshpool places 
suffered great destruction property hands glendower seeing hope insurrection put english resolved take matter hands 
fifteen hundred gathered secretly surrounded glendower one mountain intrenchments 
repulsed attacks situation desperate 
provisions ran short 
unable summon help last determined little body followers endeavor cut way besiegers 
attack sudden fierce 
flemings knowing smallness force made preparations repel attack seized panic fierce appearance wild cries welsh fell upon fury two hundred flemings slain welsh cut way beleaguering line 
news feat received immense enthusiasm throughout principality 
great numbers flocked glendower standard bards sung songs victory every village wales formidable position become lords marches wrote king saying matter gone altogether beyond presence army urgently needed 
even ludlow extra sentries placed upon walls garrison kept constant state vigilance mounted men stationed miles bring news approach hostile force 
tis thousand pities sir edmund said news defeat flemings reached fellows send news day two undertook business case would headed force couple hundred best men arms joined spot mountains may sure glendower would never fought way 
flemings doubtless stout fighters proved country unused mountain warfare fight wild men doubtless scared shrill cries welsh always advance battle 
doubtless men glendower keeps best fighters knew succeed making way mercy would shown seeing shown none 
battle plain doubt flemings would stood many times number welshmen owen hill warfare altogether strange course habit quickly rallying meeting attack second nature men arms 
affair serious unless king comes hither army glendower likely way side border ere long englishman left west severn 
however henry informed danger lost time assembling another great army beginning june advanced wales ravaged wide extent country carrying arms cardiganshire destroying abbey strata florida one venerable famous abbeys wales 
founded burnt wars king edward first welsh soon rebuilt 
llewellyn convened chieftains wales take oath allegiance 
two copies national records one kept abbey conway 
abbey fallen henry army met scarcely resistance glendower knowing wild followers match royal troops 
therefore contented harassing continually army suffered greatly continued annoyance well fatigue famine 
thus king returned across border without achieved success whatever 
lords marches ordered contribute troops hold castles strongly lest army fairly entangled among mountains glendower make great incursion england 
advantage gained english invasion king promises pardon rewards drew away number leading men hitherto acted glendower 
defection however made enthusiasm excited spectacle second retirement great english army without effected anything importance 
evident october henry advanced contingents fewer twenty two counties 
season however already unfavourable operations enduring great hardships suffering army fell back effected even less two preceded 
things however turned fortunately oswald 
army advanced week across border messenger arrived ludlow letter london king 
easy matter forward sir edmund said despatch handed 
indeed see done 
beyond fact king intended march west know nothing whatever intentions exact road likely take 
orders strict keep forces well hand send letter forward would need two hundred men least escort 
places awkward position indeed 
please sir edmund said oswald one group standing round messenger handed letter mortimer endeavor carry despatch 
methinks fifty men would succeed getting army two might perchance manage 
shall course ride first shrewsbury king passed follow course took 
great difficulty march great body men must left many traces behind 
doubtless harried country distance side line followed likely meet welsh near army 
course great caution would used like enough parties glendower men hanging skirts cut stragglers plunder waggons whose horses may fallen way 
tis terribly dangerous service sir edmund said gravely truth see way forwarding letter aught know may high importance 
desperate enterprise also one bring great credit safely carried 
go give letter king saying volunteered desperate undertaking loyalty person possible letter may contain matter highest importance realm general 
shall add already greatly distinguished service welsh trusty esquire brother law sir henry percy 
quite feel sir edmund enterprise dangerous one nevertheless determined permission undertake 
henchman together gone dangers great may pass well 
give answer half hour master oswald talked knights heard opinions whether better plan devised 
oswald bowed retired seeking roger told offer made 
well master bent upon enterprise find backward indeed sick six months idleness seeing others marching wales fight nothing saint bride ask go glendower stronghold pluck beard would willingly go 
oswald laughed 
tis bad roger yet tis service great danger 
think best set horse foot roger looked surprised question 
would surely better go horseback master met many welshmen fight might least ride away 
truth roger hand feet carry us mountains fells horses could go 
mounted must travel beaten tracks might seized parties welsh lurking woods knew presence 
without horses could keep within shelter trees could evade observation might stationed lofty hills watch body troops following track army 
moreover trouble forage water steeds 
enough master see way inclinations lie legs long holiday right carry bit assuredly tis easier footmen hide horsemen 
say roger would best leave armor well horses behind 
attacked numbers armor serve us little without may able even chased avoid hands welshmen 
say swift foot hold northumbrian border men ought able welsh especially legs nigh foot longer greater part 
well master 
great love traveling armor would almost soon march monk gown breastplate back piece 
well arrange 
shall carry provisions may sure shall get nothing whatever following army 
strip country clean 
know terribly suffered famine two previous expeditions assuredly better 
food however procure shrewsbury point shall take start 
retainer moment came hall informed oswald sir edmund would speak 
entered mortimer said knights agree letter ought sent forward king contains matters importance great harm might result delay king anger excited us sent 
orders strict neither force join therefore accept offer thanks 
formed plan proceeding oswald repeated substance said roger 
think perhaps right mortimer said may chance getting safely foot rode small force escort 
ready start speak private touching things connected journey 
oswald returned mortimer said see master oswald position means simple 
doubt king regards favourable eye 
holds nephews keeping doubtless imagines bear ill 
uncle supposes time party formed place earl march throne leader matter though assuredly never given reason doubt loyalty 
say approved deposition king richard indeed like lord grey many nobles among percys warm supporter king henry cause 
hold altogether neutral matter 
saw nothing would ruinous country boy like nephew mount throne party formed make king instead henry would taken share 
nevertheless getting fact right earl march king england saying may come future assuredly present time ready duty towards king henry louder expressions attachment 
nevertheless well aware king distrusts 
see three times invaded wales come near ludlow 
summoned join banner nay strictly ordered send man arms join 
letter troubles somewhat 
carried shrewsbury instead brought hither indeed come london sent may know king would move shrewsbury line would indeed direct advancing montgomery cardiganshire 
hand may snare 
send forward might blame greatly holding back 
send forward perchance falls way hands welsh might harbor thought even accuse openly conniving glendower 
one pretext good another however unlikely may king desires make quarrel one vassals 
offer carry seasonable one goes far get difficulty 
first place sending afford ground say disobeyed orders send one following army next place whatever suspicion may assuredly none percys largely owes crown trusted squire hotspur bearer letter sufficient proof could done done safe carriage 
fail deliver least put fault mine 
sir james burgon sir philip haverstone offered carry urging danger fall upon still esquire duty towards affair shame remain idle rode perhaps death 
assuredly feelings circumstances placed certainly intrust enterprise laying whole matter pointing coming two knights would breach king orders saw since willing undertake best 
doubt henry would unwillingly fasten quarrel 
army hand march hither could seize lands nephew partition among friends condition strike single blow defense 
know well enough king wishes get rid one nobles never great difficulty finding pretext arrest execution 
quite understand sir edmund part assuredly best place letter hands king 
shall say sir henry percy household knowing lord would glad opportunity striking blow king leading volunteered letter arrived bear seeing majesty laid orders keep force readiness repel glendower issue quarter granted request bearer 
well oswald 
know danger means small trust may surmount 
shall send letter today hotspur 
doubtless writing explain suffered undertake dangerous enterprise 
two hours later oswald despatched messenger hotspur letter mortimer mounted roger rode shrewsbury 
able gather little news present position army 
four days messengers arrived king 
last news effect army marching forward montgomeryshire 
first starting made long march welshpool thence proceeded newtown 
way welsh rushed hills fallen baggage slain many drivers killed many horses necessary leave waggons behind 
newtown halted parties sent directions harry country part force left welshpool marched upon llanfair 
last news come king 
welshpool heard next day several skirmishes welsh heavy rains made roads impassable 
messages come 
surprising certain welsh would close behind army advanced would great occasion send news back king would care weaken detaching escorts sufficient strength make way 
could sure way king going roger would much shorter us made direct llanidloes 
certainly would master oswald see might turned north case perhaps unable gather news whereabouts run small risk getting throats cut 
evident roger king marching present direction plinlimmon 
doubt hopes glendower come give battle methinks foolish enough 
weather hills fight far better welsh leave army wander mountains forests last time ensure must ere long fall back 
daybreak next morning set rode welshpool 
walled town population almost entirely english could leave horses safety 
first went governor upon oswald explaining bearers letter king asking whether could give information direction best take shook head 
news come hither last five days said 
herd bullocks arrived three days since forwarded army welsh force every road beset 
parties come hills overlooking us fired several houses escaped last attacked us 
force sufficient hold town attacks spare many men would required convoy cattle 
told king went said welshman would dare show army passed every welsh house village would destroyed within put sword difficulty sending forward cattle supplies 
villages destroyed doubt messengers came llanfair told passed hills could see smoke rising forests directions whether inhabitants remained quietly awaiting arrival troops doubtful 
beacon fires hills night army left shrewsbury next night 
since seen came llanfair told us burning every hill night got doubt old men women children sent probably shelter plinlimmon district mayhap forests cader idris 
rate may sure found villages 
last time king army marched along made way denbigh anglesey 
welsh care little burning houses 
takes two three days work rebuild 
harrying villages bring matter day nearer conclusion 
destroying castles houses better class effect produced 
peasants little lose 
welsh gentry houses estates fear losing may drive abandon glendower come us 
many king last invasion 
methinks best policy would spare villagers give peasants cause complaint war leaders 
sir remote chance getting best wait army returns levies may arrived late shrewsbury come way join king 
inquired shrewsbury last night sir heard parties expected contingents counties joined king worcester day ordered 
intention man arms leave horses go forward foot 
way travel part forests may escape seen 
already left armor behind us ludlow able move rapidly 
northumbrians accustomed traverse moors fells even seen straggling party enemy shall fair chance outrunning throwing track 
rate duty endeavor carry letter king 
matter life death know sir 
royal messenger brought london ludlow 
ridden relays horses means getting farther begged sir edmund mortimer forward 
esquire sir henry percy staying guest sir edmund know lord brother law volunteered carry anxious opportunity service king 
bold offer young man doubtless made scarce aware dangerous business undertook 
think would use would furnish twenty men arms ride know force would way add safety 
might get far llanidloes llanfair whichever route might choose though think would beyond would hopeless force less five hundred good fighting men attempt make way 
hear least fifteen thousand welshmen arms 
many doubtless glendower 
rest scattered among hills ready pounce upon party may moving valleys join king plenty places couple hundred men could check advance army 
necessary sir trust good fortune making way unseen 
may pray take care horses till return claim never doubtless many upon could bestow rarely good animals one presented sir henry percy sir edmund mortimer 
take care willingly 
return king marches back find comes reach use horses holding always property time return claim 
aught else help sir would things valuable us would guide seen heard welsh fear reliance whatever placed one 
certainly present 
take one would slip away first opportunity englishman far know could guide mountains 
case sir must perforce travel close roads sure wander track keeping shelter forest 
possible course governor agreed lost among hills would certain death 
failed fall anyone would die hunger 
meet anyone would killed 
glendower spares englishman falls hands 
know greatly blamed sir oswald said smile seeing welsh meet scant mercy us 
tis savage war governor said shrugging shoulders seems continue last welshman exterminated 
difficult thing indeed effect oswald laughed difficult extermination wolves england hope matters arrange long 
surely time welsh leaders see struggle hopeless one lose homes possessions lives continue 
brave welsh may withstand whole strength england 
may exist forests time valleys fertile lands english hands last forced submit 
would seem edward said thing scotland 
carried fire sword time time yet scotland still king holds border 
sir scotland large country whereas wales small one towns castles english ports people although brave wholly without discipline able fight mountains scots strong enough give battle us level ground defeated us 
advice leave town night governor said oswald rose leave 
may many welsh lying round us doubtless learn countrymen 
give scroll ordering allowed pass time night day 
thank sir 
intended start tomorrow morning two hours daybreak get well forest sunrise 
shall course go first llanidloes doubtless strong guard left 
far well miss way shall keep along side valley 

beyond river mere streamlet make across hills 
know sir whether force went llanfair effect junction king believe rate present 
party march west king force move south plinlimmon lord talbot cross range hills come upon river dovey possible prevent glendower still plinlimmon making way dinas mowddwy cader idris snowdon 
plan doubtless good another doubt whether talbot force ten times numerous could prevent glendower slipping away 
evening oswald bought supply bread meat sufficient last roger three days 
divided halves placed bags would slung shoulders 
horses already sent castle sleeping hours two left town turning right ascended hill 
oswald carried sword dagger 
roger addition heavy oaken quarterstaff 
said may service mountain work may suffice crack skulls half dozen welshmen may fall 
put plain leather jerkins cloth caps wore underneath suits percy cognizance embroidered order might present proper attire arrive king camp 
weather already becoming cold double suit therefore uncomfortable 
dress welsh towns valleys similar worn english villagers would attract little attention cause take road short distance 
keeping within edge belt trees followed valley past ruins montgomery passed newtown without entering 
many times morning heard loud shouts woods answered similar cries side valley obliged move great caution evident considerable number welsh ambush woods readiness attack party might proceeding valley 
towards noon obliged leave edge forest ascend brow hills certain parties enemy might forest would assembled near edge readiness pour suddenly 
heard voices short distance away paused time allow parties men cross ahead 
greatest danger lay crossing side valleys welsh would expecting one come succeeded crossing without observed 
well content night falling came upon llanidloes 
crossing wooden bridge stream entered town boldly looking upon seen many men armor streets knew place occupied english 
gate end bridge asked business replied could answer officer commanding taken 
whence come friends latter said 
surely must english height times like present know 
come king army north left welshpool daybreak oswald said traveled forest 
must bold tall sirs woods full wild welsh 
aware sir difficulty making way unobserved 
would answer guard entered going farther mentioned hearing welshman news might sent ahead 
think reach king 
last heard foremost divisions marching forward devastating country sides line march 
heard reports parties attacked well nigh destroyed certain glendower men scattered country 
three days without news morning strong party came escorting sick wounded 
fight hard beat opponents got loss third number 
started night fortunately arrived within five miles attacked 
king sir king capel bangor army lies place yspetty cynfyn 
tis day march would short day march could follow road would impossible tis beset everywhere tis rough hilly places men arms dismount 
wait till large force sets provisions came declare attempt return great number welshmen along fierce reckless 
yet told would push army thus rashly 
oswald opened jerkin showed handsome attire beneath embroidered percy cognizance 
esquire sir henry percy said staying sir edmund mortimer whose sister lord wife 
royal messenger arrived ludlow letter king way bringing forward volunteered carry man arms 
brave offer young sir fear scarce able carry effect 
men came report unsafe stir yard camp wander away however short distance sure slain lurking welshmen 
resistance offered strong parties go less two hundred men arms hope move unattacked 
tis reason come foot oswald said 
saw would hopeless two horsemen get foot may travel woods without discovered seen methinks would need speedy feet catch us 
well since bear royal letter stop seems chance getting small indeed 
chapter knighted 
rain coming torrents oswald roger started next morning 
leaving town turned left intention making considerable detour keeping well away road near welsh would likely watching 
chose side right road country broken rising swell swell towards plinlimmon likely largest portion welsh would side could time retire fastnesses 
soon woods 
streams met turbid full brim 
shall trouble water roger oswald said waded across one waist deep 
little stream larger ones like enough shall swim done 
one advantage weather even welsh scarce active 
got much clothing wet roger said 
dress better suited weather 
way rough one 
hills although great height crossed many streams waded 
fortunately met larger first crossed water side hills made way part direct severn came slopes plinlimmon towards road fell stream dry fine weather raging torrent ran past llandulas severn llanidloes 
think going right roger oswald said walking six seven hours ups downs turnings windings saying east west 
sun shining sure direction dull leaden clouds saying 
idea master 
moor able judge make fairly straight course keeping wind rain one side us thick forest though leaves fallen remain branches break rain seems come straight upon us 
presently came another watercourse 
roger water going direction master 
possible crossed dividing point water making way towards south fall river much afraid real explanation entirely lost way going opposite direction started 
question shall cross shall follow like roger said 
think best way would find place could shelter 
tomorrow sun may tell us way go 
start daybreak keep back go far wrong 
except may pass army altogether roger 
told us rearmost division ten miles ahead 
must walked double already say master 
much 
long time slow traveling broken ground thick wood 
sure hope gone twenty miles anything like case keeping fairly right direction must passed army 
going wrong direction saying may 
still think suggestion good one 
use going may getting farther away every step 
lucky bought thick cloaks welshpool without soaked skin hours ago 
well wetted waist score times streams see would mattered much rest us wet 
well let us look shelter 
searching half hour found spot wall shaly rock barred way 
one spot fallen forming sort shallow cave three feet deep 
bad beginning roger must try make great deal snug 
first cut young fir poles placed form sort penthouse wall 
piled number branches trees foot thickness 
far good oswald said 
roger look fallen tree 
passed scores way 
must get thoroughly rotten one cut away portion side dry enough 
might get little start roger said ground covered everywhere fir cones better stuff fires 
taking cloak laid piled fir cones great heap collected 
carried shelter opening left penthouse 
must something dry start 
cones great deal wet burn without good heat start 
nothing better fir needles master find dry ones 
searching considerable number needles collected lying fallen trees others swept wind rocky corners rain reached 
think shall roger 
soon inside roger produced large lump dry fungus found side severn aid flint steel soon succeeded striking sparks upon 
soon began spread put little pile fir needles blowing gently bright flames soon darted 
handfuls fuel added fir cones placed top quarter hour clear bright fire burning 
dripping cloaks hung fir poles dry jerkins also damp although water penetrated spread near fire 
well bought little skin wine last night roger said 
thought better without burden weight gallon wine count much makes difference comfort 
rain soaked provision bags bread meat center dry made hearty meal laying wetted food round fire dry wound repast long draught wine 
soon breeches dry master oswald shall thoroughly comfortable 
yes one wish nothing better 
must forget welshmen may come along sure want know inside 
unless happen dozen curiosity may cost dear roger said grimly 
think much fear 
neither seen heard since started would evil fortune indeed party happened come along spot 
fact heard one bad sign roger would seem show must gone long way course 
rain continued fall heavily afternoon throughout night change weather discernible next morning 
best stop another day roger unless sky clears likely find good place shelter use wander every step may taking us farther away 
however climb top hill whose foot endeavor get view country 
roger shook head 
heavy mist see quarter mile away 
got clothes dry would pity get wet without need profit 
anyhow find fir cones 
supply nearly gone 
half hour got sufficient last day 
nothing sleep one keeping watch prevent chance surprised 
lying night roger looked 
methinks rain stopped though would difficult say drops keep pattering trees 
well mightily hope fine morning 
oswald first upon feet going uttered exclamation satisfaction 
morning breaking though light clouds moving across sky glimpses blue visible 
already light showed sun would presently rise 
food hastily eaten started way 
could mistake general direction keeping sun right hand made way north 
top hill somewhat higher others caught view plinlimmon 
make straight oswald said ought come road near camp 
go fearlessly time welsh hardly likely moving yesterday day doubt sheltered best could arbors like 
walking another two hours heard distant sound trumpet 
two three miles away roger 
shall careful 
walked mile descended glen came suddenly party twenty welshmen sitting round fire 
concealed thick undergrowth twenty yards away first saw 
welsh evidently heard coming rustle leaves breaking twigs two three standing looking direction caught sight 
gave loud yell brought rest feet 
run roger run
