next day thursday

room formerly used purposes storage glass china merchant workshop saddler explained pervading odour leather 
little group men stood conversation near fire egremont appearance seated desks producing note book laid open 
thus ranged seen eight number 
fourteen invitations addressed nine presented preliminary meeting one know since proved unfaithful 
egremont looked round ackroyd entering young man 
front bench two men yet know name 
mr bower clearly distinguishable personal importance ennui disguised listened opening sentences lecture

man fair instance way prosperity affects average proletarian better qualities honesty perseverance sobriety took ignoble color essential vulgarity nature would never offensively declared ill fortune kept anxious daily bread 
formerly egremont impressed intelligent manner closer observation proved little worth intelligence subordination paltry character 
bower regarded originator course lectures obsequiousness easy see deemed co operation indispensable success project 
first natural egremont sometimes seemed address words specially late purposely avoided bower began feel services lacked recognition 
casual mention joseph bunce 
spare frame hollow cheeks suggested insufficiency diet yet far manliness appearance portly bower 
divined independence enough worthier origin secretly inflated neighbor 
features first sight means pleasing coarseness undeniable familiarity revealed sensitive significance irregular nose prominent lips small chin long throat 
egremont caught light eyes warranty rough tongue could shape words 
often appeared difficulty following lecture would shrug nervously knit brows mutter 
whenever noticed egremont would pause little repeat simpler form saying satisfactory result bunce showed clearer face jotted something dirty note book stumpy pencil

evenings pure enjoyment 
delighted subject inexpressible pleasure listening continuously speech cultivated man 
note books class examined egremont strongly advised use gilbert jottings would probably alone found substantial value seeing alone possessed mental habit necessary practice 
bunce would doubtless come next though long distance carlylean editor might disengaged many rudely forcible scrap comment 
bower pages would smelt day book 
grail egremont mentally directed best things say seldom repaid quick gleam sympathy grave interesting face 
remaining five hearers average artisans inquiring type followed perseverance though times one would furtively regard watch allow eyes stray room 
made bargain bent honourably carrying share 
egremont already began doubt whether really fixing anything thoughts 
likely serve greater purpose whereto instruction preliminary looked forward fix eyes grail forget others 
beginning regret choice invitations sent depended upon bower another man might aided effectually 
yet fact bower selection remarkably good one 
would difficult assemble nine lambeth workmen higher aggregate intellect responded summons would hand easiest thing find nine man available anything futile wrangling politics religion 
egremont would know day yet young social reform 
lectures much say good 
egremont capacity teaching education without resources would probably chosen academic career done service

annabel present wedding 
second week march mr newthorpe felt able leave ullswater annabel little mind leave purpose immediately establishment eastbourne 
indeed would rather attended wedding circumstances 
father gravely ill 
organic disease vaguely called nervous breakdown clear mr newthorpe must count upon moderate activity either mind body henceforth 
quite unprepared collapse accepted genial pessimism 
fate said life result nothing nothing point view early aspirations 
yet annabel memory life passion 
lay silence days spring combated winter learned acquiescence among happier men could look back upon days great joy forward without ignoble anxiety 
felt abandonment ullswater final yet would say annabel 
mrs ormonde made ready house short distance two would live events summer beyond must hinge circumstances 
broke journey couple days london staying relatives 
days paula behaved prettily 
certain affection grown uncle whilst ullswater meeting dolefully changed conditions touched best feelings 
yet cousin reserved behavior bear evidence latent tenderness admiration contained letter saw 
annabel looked something 
longing affection sympathy paula girl friend 
paula would speak mr dalmaine absurdest thing politics 
annabel retired 
glad reach length quiet house sea glad near mrs ormonde 
circumstances annabel early life worked happily inherited disposition 
father free choose would planned training differently likelihood less advantage derived compromise parents 
though time mother death still waited formal recognition member society sixteen riper growth majority young ladies season led forth review perfect arts civilisation 
mother learned directly indirectly much little world deems greater world satellite father received love knowledge reverence nobler modes life 
marked happy balance character came without seemed naturally assimilate due proportions tastes imaginative temper tending joyousness susceptible grave impressions 
relished books yet never allowed hold bodily exercise knew happiness solitude yet could render welcomest companionship one time conversed earnestly older wiser another willing playmate laughing girls 
loved could possibility loved one another turn seemed discover sure insight strength beauty diverse characters 
breadth sympathy developed self consciousness kind women never attain habitually studying making comparison others cultivated understanding emotions simultaneously 
time serious study began exchanged london mountain solitude 
henceforth father influence exerted freely annabel reached age profiting 
bringing brilliant drawing room well stocked library preserved two dangers english girls free born class mainly exposed escaped puritanism yet equally withheld frivolous worldliness 
well balance admirably maintained thus far submitted risks life awaited come change conditions 
would beautiful woman unaware social instincts society would straightway best abuse might outweigh spiritual tendencies 
year life ullswater consolidated womanhood 
bent books eagerness 
shock sorrow compelled muse problems yet either realized solved light tradition childwise 
mind ripe modern processes thought hitherto implicit education 
father annabel companionship invaluable 
repaid richly abundance youthful life anxious guidance gave thoughts 
loving tact sweetened many hour would else spent profitless brooding signs become aware warned needed drawn always ready bright converse priceless sympathy 
without would seldom exerted wander far house annabel could time lead hill valley pretending need holiday 
communion kind frequently existing father daughter fellowship study made mental comrades respect intellectual powers added natural love 
discuss classical archaeology fire new theories day art science something passed one time another scrutiny 
yet limit imposed fine feeling 
mr newthorpe never tried pass sacred bound parts father province mother 
much girl heart would gladly read yet could reveal 
instance often speak egremont 
letter arrived mr newthorpe always gave annabel read times subject spoke introduced 
walter departure one conversation annabel told come pass went far speak certain trouble paula account

much 
thereafter spoke egremont unconstrained way 
annabel showed frank interest concerned far mr newthorpe could discern nothing interest friendliness 
months went discerned change 
life cheerful steadily industrious ever nothing betrayed unsettlement thought 
father chance entered room studied found bent books face beautiful calm zeal 
first grave symptoms illness father opened new chapter annabel life 
time lay aside books little fated scheme existence required point new experiences 
student habit readily reconcile demands practical energy endurance first strain fear stricken love relaxed annabel fell days grievous weakness despondency summoned study miseries sick room mere nervous force failed 
father relapse able face demand upon sternly 
trial passing severe one 
invalid could keep bright face make presence ever blessing 
alone cared longer books beauty home 
remember passage letter egremont world seems dark life dreadful penalty 
could uttered much text one secret 
one day mr newthorpe recovering strength came letter mrs tyrrell announced date paula marriage 
annabel received letter read 
sitting father little later said return humorous mood wonder footing egremont new household suppose annabel replied acquaintance mr dalmaine continue slightest 
paused little quietly glad marriage 
annabel said nothing

annabel led conversation away 
singular thoughts subject 
paula letter first announcing engagement made mention egremont curious way least strange hap paula marry man egremont expressed antipathy 
father said annabel new care dark mood feed upon 
felt words glad marriage concerned 
meant father glad removal perchance one barrier egremont 
long weeks anguished spectacle suffering become first desire comfort sufferer 
ideal placid life shattered things availed formerly seemed weak rely upon 
dark world guidance save hand love egremont full intellectual sympathy thought becoming wife painful associations could bring abandon ideal love developed development must relinquish hope great passion take hand man merely liked respected question must decide walter met might seek win 
idealism derived father would allow yet regard life compromise women skilled practically though better part end revolts 
yet life bestow highest blessing upon tyrrells house london feared lest egremont come 
mrs tyrrell spoke much first evening lamenting withdrawn friends 
come 
eastbourne mr newthorpe health began improve 
even week change marked 
seemed taken resolve restore old order things force 
doubtless conversations mrs ormonde annabel incentive effort relieved weight suffering could see girl 
paula marriage day said course conversation annabel aunt desires much part season 
think would care go may annabel reject idea 
opinion need change father continued 
last quarter year done harm

town secretly attracting 
odour tyrrells house exercised certain seduction 
though saw one two old acquaintances dining room drawing room brought past vividly back 
wholly alien mother blood stage life world without appeal circumstances favourable revival element character touched upon speaking growth childhood 
common piece observation studious gravity youth succeeded desire action enjoyment 
annabel disposition study return though quietness restored surroundings 
thus though settlement eastbourne seemed relief soon found effect hoped

came faces unanticipated moments saw looked walking back lake side declared taste rain sweet 
best life involuntary flash memory upon instants eager past better present joy ever core disappointment better far better hope warm without burning 
annabel surpassingly beautiful knew brief vision 
beautiful still new type loveliness come admiration could regard without emotion 
journey london one incessant anticipation tormented doubt 
would presence conquer royally assure dominion convert intellectual fealty passionate desire regarded without emotion 
yet annabel calm wished 
force could exchange greetings without evidence friendly pleasure 
irritated hour ago said coming would way disturb 
hour talk left father guest together went room first feeling acknowledged one disappointment 
egremont changed thought better 
lost something perchance freshness purpose become well 
seemed talk undertakings less spontaneously tone could quite say tone perhaps suggested least little lack sincerity 
agitation entered room meant nothing nothing

thought make life great foolish game suppose saying thousand pounds shall buy yacht play shall lift living man soul darkness light broke laughed bitterly 
annabel glanced 
noticed thoughts cast frequent mind though formerly strange 
used face problems simple directness positive spirit idealist enthusiasm leaned scepticism though endeavor conceal tendency 
struck likeness change suffering yet touch sympathies anxious forthwith avoid coincidence 
offer answer replied

hope grave enough fitting companion opened lips altered words speak 
saw minutes chance meeting 
impressed favourably 
walked leisurely way half hour turned mists creeping westward pevensey afternoon air growing chill 
sound sea divided lengthwise two tracts different hue near land pale green spread horizon cold gray 
nothing passed could recall last day together nothing beyond one exclamation egremont annabel hardly appeared notice 
neither desired prolong conversation

future made promises beyond saying library building two rooms devoted lectures 
library chief care 
something solid would establish self confidence 
yes thoughts present failure 
first lecture far away best 
dealt religion 
addressed audience ready philosophical views would met flattering reception 
egremont point view strictly aesthetic aimed replacing religious enthusiasm commonly understood aesthetic 
loveliness christian legend started 
dealt new testament much formerly dealt elizabethan poets 
would appeal vulgar aggressive rationalists 
let rationalism filter course time vulgar prepared yet 
bad superstitious worse far worse brutally irreverent brutal irreverence inevitably came atheism preached street corner 
men preached last guide human souls coarsest fiber without note music fit world grosser purposes 
presumed attack ministry christ good say point better made two three hearers feel little sore indignant 
yet whole lecture appealed one audience 
gilbert grail heard emotion carried away heart 
others little sounding brass tinkling cymbals 
night friday going grail course ceremonious preparation necessary yet wasted couple hours previous time setting forth
