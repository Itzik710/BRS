ah said mighty angel continuing descent meet us almost gate within hearing words well soldiers take heaven storm hear horde black bats frontiers make short work seeing horse elephants clambering behind us take animals royal stables added tend turn king forest 
welcome home said us bending low sweetest smile 
immediately turned led way higher 
scales armor flashed like flakes lightning 
thought form tell felt thus received officers heaven

went city passed 
wall upper side huge pile broken rocks upsloping like moraine eternal glacier openings rocks river came billowing 
top could dimly discern seemed three four great steps stair disappearing cloud white snow steps saw mind eye grand old chair throne ancient days 
steps issued plenteously unceasingly new born river water life 
great angel could guide us farther rocks must ascend alone heart beating hope desire held faster hand lona began climb soon let go use hands well feet toilsome ascent huge stones 
length drew near cloud hung steps like borders garment passed fringe entered deep folds 
hand warm strong laid hold mine drew little door golden lock 
door opened hand let mine go pushed gently 
turned quickly saw board large book act closing behind 
stood alone library

last waking also dream still chamber death asleep dreaming yet ripe enough wake go sleep outright heartily come awake soon waking dream surely dream better waking yet come sport false vision dream must yet lovelier truth heart dreaming moments doubt cry could god create lovely things dreamed whence came thy dream answers hope

man dreams dream sport dream another gives able fulfil 
never sought mirror 
hand sent back go door days appointed time wait till change come 
look round books seem waver wind rippled solid mass another world break 
sometimes abroad like thing takes place heavens earth trees grass appear moment shake pass away lo settled old familiar face times seem hear whisperings around loved talking would distinguish words cease still 
know whether things rise brain enter without 
seek come let go 
strange dim memories abide identification often misty windows past look upon broad daylight never dream 
may notwithstanding awake dreaming wake last life mother child carries life bosom shall know wake shall doubt 
wait asleep awake wait 
novalis says life dream perhaps become one
