chapter xxiv 
dove joke 
primrose always considered good manager 
talents contriving buying short making shilling utmost shilling capable observable earliest days 
last years mother life primrose entrusted family purse shopkeepers rosebury known better offer bright looking young lady best lowest price 
primrose therefore came london felt pretty confident talents knew possessed would stand good stead 
still hoped find cheapest shops get best money 
laid plans accuracy common sense divided little sum three live weekly instalments resolved go beyond 
alas primrose never reckoned certain grave difficulty confronted 
hitherto dealings honest tradespeople misfortune sisters get house honesty far practiced 
thousand little ways mrs dove could pilfer girls would world acknowledged would really steal oh consider stealing use coal instead course mistake means considered stealing baked little joint oven sunday boil first way secure good soup various hungry young doves consider stealing confuse baker account loaves consumed children paid primrose consider stealing add water milk supplied mainwarings things point emphatic thought reverse stealing borrow 
primrose fortnight house began ask first loan odd sixpence half crown shilling two shillings 
returned half crown generally done fashion oh please miss want settle little account 
oh dear dear certain half crown purse 
well sure forgot dove took went work morning 
please miss mainwaring accept one sixpence account settle rest hour two 
miss quite comfortable 
yes arrangement certainly quite comfortable mrs dove could score half crown debt slate quite stare primrose ventured ask odd shilling still owing 
still incredible may sound mrs dove considered strictly honest woman 
perhaps girls deal might struggled badly true still fashion 
alas alas mrs dove considered honest mr dove pretend lay claim excellent quality 
poor primrose little guessed lost five pound note given trouble almost brought gray hairs bright yellow head really taken dove come attics girls away quietly taken hinges primrose trunk back lifted lid helped neatly deftly solitary note girls discovered loss one indignant dove 
come speak examined trunk presence told cousin detective business would put scent thief meantime pleased although remarkably poor man lend young ladies ten shillings 
although would think accepting loan girls thought dove behaved rather kindly occasion certainly never least suspected pocket money gone 
without therefore blame poor primrose found christmas approached days grew short cold little money possession course quarter allowance would soon due days came broken last sovereign 
still resource sisters forgotten luckily dove knew nothing still letter mr danesfield never opened always kept safely locked trunk 
worlds would yet break seal letter meant hour great need 
primrose fondly proudly hoped dark dreadful hour would never approach success sisters might yet return letter unopened kind donor 
dark days christmas kept heart worked hard china painting achieving sufficient success power art enable produce pretty alas yet unsaleable articles 
mr jones master assured however goods must ere long find market struggled bravely 
perhaps whole jasmine tried present life sister 
jasmine highly strung temperament could easily depressed easily elated kind nature pours forth sweetest best sunshine cold blasts adversity blow keenly rather tropical little flower expansion would come beautiful blossoms young life would fail fulfil promise 
jasmine never meant nature poor born italy something languor love ease beauty birthplace seemed always linger round 
talents certain conditions might even developed genius sense word hardy primrose could endure even conquer jasmine might die 
little sister young acutely feel change part primrose jasmine perhaps one three whose spirits par old rosebury days although daisy little mind remained tranquil trouble ways means greatly fret fact skies leaden attic room foggy still daisy also suffered rather delicate little body 
caught cold london fogs cold brought cough cough produced loss appetite 
two elder sisters however scarcely yet uneasy miss egerton saw likeness little constance growing growing daisy sweet face 
thus christmas drew near girls yet found mission life means crushed however primrose tired repeating firmly believed new year sunshine london life would
