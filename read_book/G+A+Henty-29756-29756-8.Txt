jethro happened battle lost prince conveying back city 
rough fall narrow escape life fighting even fighting good 
king father amuba said struggling feet 
see fall know naught certain jethro replied 
terrible fight raging carry could take share 
besides arrow left arm moment later would gone body instead

indeed true jethro called amuba attention wound principally sake diverting thoughts moment fear father 
amuba drove looked back

footmen small chance catching rebu 
surely men ought retreat good order jethro 
scattered slaughtered thousands egyptian chariots 
could oppose much resistance anyhow jethro replied 
plain footmen withstand chariot charge 
many doubtless fall scatter right left numbers reach hills safety take refuge woods jungles many outrun chariots 
new causeway narrow cross abreast thus though many men overtaken killed trust greater part escape 
let us draw short time jethro 
see several chariots horsemen behind main body fugitives doubtless friends

rebu well disciplined chariots thundered little groups gathered together shield overlapping shield spears projecting within circle shot arrows whirled stones slings 
horses wounded arrows often refused obey drivers rushed headlong across plain others charged fall pierced spears chariots often empty occupants broke phalanx 
thus although many fell many succeeded gaining gates town number men available defense already largely increased amuba reached walls 
although egyptian chariots came great numbers night fell without appearance main body egyptian army 
darkness set great numbers rebu troops escaped hills made way town 
men contingents furnished rebu cities naturally made way direct homes morning six thousand men left behind guard city army set swelled four times numbers 
although little half force marched battle return large number fugitives caused great abatement panic misery prevailed 
women whose husbands sons returned rejoiced regarded lost whose friends yet returned gained hopes narratives fresh comers loved ones might also survived would ere long make way back 
example queen already done much restore confidence

since foundation grandfather late king town never taken although several times besieged rebu strong hopes chariots egyptians longer feared could oppose successful resistance efforts enemy 
noon egyptian army seen advancing confident defenders city felt could resist feeling apprehension enormous force seen upon plain 
egyptian army three hundred thousand strong

host jethro said amuba arm dressed arrival palace accompanied young prince walls 
seems nation rather army 
wonder defeated yesterday long held ground many escaped battle 
wonderful truly jethro 
look long line chariots moving regular order footmen 
well us forced inactive 
others although countless numbers much walls 
towers erect upon plains place level us rock steep climbed 
would seem impossible take prince must confident 
know many towns believed impregnable captured egyptians must prepared daring enterprises 
gates already fastened great thickness rocks piled strongest part wall parts roads leading formed timber burned reach gates except climbing points 
provisions enough last well nigh year harvest brought whole district round together many thousands cattle wells abundance 
yes heard preparations made jethro doubt resist first onslaught egyptians hold far longer difficulty victualing huge army immense 
way think attack part see method offers hope success 
tell 
know us peoples around cities seem impregnable 
egyptians skilled devices war 
laid siege captured great numbers cities doubtless full plans expedients know nothing 
however morrow morning show us something 
nothing attempted day 
generals first inspect walls see assault delivered army given day rest least called upon assault position 
afternoon cort ge chariots made circuit walls shore sea round great plateau sea keeping beyond range arrows 
archers jethro said egyptian king would overbold venturing near 
wonderful strongly shoot 
arrows fully double range power sufficient carry strongest shields even strengthened metal 
seen thought impossible living men bigger stronger could sent arrows power 
stand different attitude archers though shafts fully foot longer draw head 
regarded good bowman till met egyptians feel child might watching man performing feats strength even imagined possibility 
evening great council met 
included principal officers army priests royal councilors leading men state 
discussion determined present crisis best postpone taking steps appoint successor late king long siege lasted amusis endowed absolute powers 
order loss time necessity consulting one amuba present mother council though neither took active part 
commencement announcement made name willing abide whatever council decide indeed mother son desired terrible danger hung state supreme power placed hands whomsoever general voice might select person best fitted take command extremity 
night body king consumed great funeral pile 
ordinary occasions ceremony would taken place narrow promontory jutting sea five miles city 
previous monarchs consumed sight multitude people buried beneath great mounds earth 
priests long ago pronounced place sacred kingdom declared anger gods would fall upon ventured set foot upon holy ground 
impossible present lay ashes king side forefathers ceremony therefore conducted within royal inclosure officiating priests wife son deceased present 
ashes collected placed casket destined better times returned laid sight whole people sacred inclosure promontory 
early next morning trumpets guards walls called troops arms 
soon amuba reached post saw egyptian army marching city 
arrived within bowshot archers formed front lines opened fire upon defenders walls 
arrows however part fell short besieged rained upon effect 
therefore withdrawn short distance contracting ranks vast number footmen poured irregular order ran forward foot rock sheltered arrows wall 
going amuba exclaimed laying aside bow 
jethro shook head 
working plan said 
shall see long 
listen 
even din caused vast multitude sharp metallic sound presently heard like innumerable hammers striking steel 
surely amuba exclaimed never thinking quarrying rock away great task even whole people egypt 
certainly jethro agreed yet think else intentions 
nigh hour mystery solved 
blast trumpet sounded post egyptian king placed taken along whole line great number heads appeared along edge rock foot walls 
egyptians employed driving spikes crevices rock 
standing first driven inserted others three feet higher proceeded number men climbed face rock 
let ropes ladders hauled steepest places 
great numbers ropes hung assist followed ascent men first showed brow followed stream others ledge cases feet wide crowded soldiers 
ladders hauled placed wall egyptians swarmed great numbers rebu prepared assault storm stones beams wood arrows javelins missiles rained egyptians 
many ladders spite number men upon thrown back defenders fell crash edge rock plain 
egyptians gained footing wall rebu recovered first surprise daring manner attack soon rallied attacked egyptians fury every case latter slain fighting thrown embattlements 
several hours egyptians continued efforts losing vast numbers men without obtaining success recalled sound trumpet 
serious jethro amuba said wiping perspiration forehead encouraging men assisting lifting casting massive stones beams wood 
difficult repulse conditions jethro said manner attack surprise indeed us fought greatest bravery 
see next time benefited lesson shall new device cope 
found way scale rock may expect little rest 
fight renewed evening darkness fell large number egyptians ascended rock 
rebu poured missiles upon time sufficient number climbed able stand along close foot wall great extent sheltered missiles 
night dark one night long rebu continued shower missiles upon invisible foe whose continued presence assured sounds time time heard 
daylight enabled defenders see going foot walls raised shout surprise dismay 
night egyptians hoisted ropes quantity timber brought construction shelters engaged siege operations 
timbers cut prepared fitting together easily jointed even dark 
thus besiegers looked saw forty fifty shelters erected foot walls 
formed sloped like pent house thickly covered hides 
besieged soon found solid constructions beams great stones dropped upon simply bounded leaped plain 
ladders fastened together fixed egyptians shelters plain men work could relieved reinforced occasion required 
vain besieged showered missiles vain poured caldrons boiling oil prepared readiness 
strength beams defied first hides lapping prevented second penetrating 
truly terrible foes prince jethro said 
told might expect new plans devices think day siege began find overcome difficulties natural defenses established safety foot walls 
done jethro men working shelters speedily dislodge stones facing walls without difficulty dig earthwork behind 
matter serious jethro agreed yet reason alarm 
greater portion troops assembled behind wall egyptians gain way pour openings reinforced slowly would speedily hurl edge cliff 
fear 
fear jethro fear prince know fear 
children struggle kind opposed egyptians 
already wholly overthrown calculations know next afraid 
must plain us dig walls shall rush overpower 
perhaps intend work right left undermine walls large portions tumble breaches made 
jethro shook head 
would destroy egyptian shelters bury workmen even manage retire walls fell would gain nothing 
fact wish could tumble walls case heap earth stones would rise edge rock egyptians could climb small numbers time could destroy without difficulty 
see builders made mistake surrounding city high wall would best built mere breastwork edge cliff round 
comes amusis shall hear opinion matter 
amusis looked flushed anxious although saw prince assumed expression carelessness 
egyptians going burrow walls said drive like rats holes 
think jethro know jethro said gravely 
dig walls shall certainly say drive holes believe going 
think going amusis asked roughly 
idea amusis 
wish quite sure taken trouble nothing

suppose one ever saw gods people know one head dog another cat like gods stronger others people offer sacrifices gods ask help going battle beaten victorious win day lose morrow 
gods stronger one day another care help people sometimes prevent temples burned images thrown strange 
strange chebron 
long ago asking jethro nearly question could give answer 
ask father

yes one would think chebron said thoughtfully 
yet father always taught highest duty pay honor gods way money well spent raising fresh temples adding beauty exist 
highest duty assuredly pay honor gods chebron honor paid acceptably another deeper question great deal young enter upon 
time enough years hence 
see temple standing right bank river stop night

amuba lay upon soft couch made layer bulrushes covered thick woollen cloth rested head pillow bulrushes jethro bound neither rebu learned adopt egyptian fashion using stool pillow 
stools long somewhat curved middle fit neck 
common people roughly made wood smoothed head came head stools wealthy constructed ebony cedar scarce woods beautifully inlaid ivory 
amuba made several trials head stools succeeded going sleep one head half hour sufficing cause aching neck glad take pillow rushes accustomed 
indeed sleep upon stool pillows necessary lie upon side arm placed raise head exact level stool amuba accustomed throw sleep back position first lay generally thoroughly tired either hunting exercise arms found cramped fixed position necessary sleeping hard stool absolutely intolerable 
week journey river continued arrived memphis remained days 
ameres passed time ceremonial visits taking part sacrifices temple 
chebron amuba visited temples public buildings one day went inspect great pyramids attended jethro 
surpasses anything seen jethro said stood foot great pyramid cheops 
wonderful structure frightful waste human labor marvelous indeed amuba said 
wealth power monarch must raise colossal pile thought said chebron kings bound laws well people 
could king exacted terrible toil labor subjects must cost kings bound laws chebron replied powerful haughty tyrannize people 
cheops one 
father telling ground people build wonderful tomb

shall busy days begin ameres said son evening arrival therefore good opportunity see something various branches sport enjoyed part egypt 
steward place men disposal take amuba jethro 
see slaves carry provisions tents necessary much sport rise early improbably may sleep close hand 
morning chebron interview steward told arranged plan expedition

lord father said would probably away week return would time time day hunting parts 
thought time occupied better make distant expedition begin 
hour later twenty slaves drew house carrying heads provisions tents necessaries 
horse provided chebron decided would walk amuba 
advantage going horse said move pace footmen possibly may find something shoot way 
leader party upon hearing chebron decision told doubtless left cultivated country extended miles north game would found 
six dogs accompanied 
four powerful animals kept chase formidable beasts hyena lion although lions flat country abounded broken grounds foot hills south

dogs held high honor egypt

chebron amuba carrying bows walked along chatting gayly head party 
jethro rabah foreman came next 
followed two slaves leading dogs leashes ready slipped moment notice carriers followed rear 
occasionally passed scattered villages women came doors look strangers generally offerings milk fruit made 
men part work fields 
stout looking race

stubborn deal replied 
till ground well pay portion produce without grumbling extra labor asked sure trouble 
easier manage thousand egyptian peasants hundred israelites forced labor required public service always necessary bring troops obtain 
indeed hardly treated fairly suffered much 
arrived egypt reign usertuen land allotted

many burdens laid upon 
give far fair share labor toward public works making bricks erection royal tombs pyramids 
strange shave heads people chebron said 
amuba laughed jethro 
different chebron replied 
labor get dust soil hair 
besides keep cut quite short 
still think would comfortable followed fashion 
matter habit amuba replied 
us first came sight poorer people going heads shaven quite repulsive comfort surely one hair must comfortable great wigs better class wear 
keep sun chebron said one doors seldom worn house one comes one wash dust 
wash dust hair amuba said 
still think israelites wear hair inconveniently long yet long plaits women wear back certainly graceful women fair comely 
chebron shook head 
may fair amuba think would make troublesome wives 
lack altogether subdued submissive look women 
would say opinions submissive lords rabah women like men spirit fire foreman answered much voice domestic matters know us 
certainly use tongues times soldiers take away gangs men public works trouble men 
latter sullen know must submit women gather little distance scream curses abuse troops sometimes even pelt stones knowing soldiers draw weapon upon although infrequently necessary order put stop tumult haul two three leaders prison 
thought viragoes chebron said laugh 
would rather hunt lion women one villages set upon 
miles cultivation became rare sandhills took place level fields hollows patches cultivated ground 
rabah ordered slave leading two fleet dogs keep close readiness slip 
may see deer time said 
abound sandy deserts form shelter yet within easy distance fields vegetation fails go food 
minutes later deer started clump bushes 
dogs instantly let slip started pursuit 
hurry hundred yards take position mound rabah exclaimed chebron time signaled slaves behind stop 
dogs know duty see presently drive stag within shot 
chebron called amuba follow ran forward 
time reached mound stag far away dogs laboring pursuit 
present seemed gained little upon soon hidden sight among sandhills 
spite assurance rabah lads doubts whether dogs would ever drive quarry back spot standing full quarter hour pursuers pursued came sight 
pace greatly fallen one dogs twenty yards behind stag flank distance away evidently aiding turning toward spot boys standing 
shoot together chebron said 
come within fifty yards us 
waited stag abreast 
dog flank fallen back side companion leave stag clear arrows hunters 
lads fired together stag abreast running faster allowed arrows flew behind 
uttered exclamations disappointment deer run twenty yards gave sudden leap air fell 
jethro crept taken post behind bushes left clump readiness shoot others miss arrow brought stag ground 
well done jethro amuba shouted 
long since hunting seem lost skill matters since brought 
dogs stood quiet beside deer struggling ground well trained interfere 
jethro ran cut throat 
others soon standing beside 
species smaller deer europe belong two long straight horns 
make useful addition fare night rabah said although perhaps sorts better eating 
dogs never pull amuba asked 
seldom 
two particularly fleet doubt whether would caught 
deer run long time although let dogs gain upon leave choose 
still known couple run deer could succeed driving within bowshot know well ought course deer use food unless animals properly killed blood allowed escape 
several stags startled escaped dogs fatigued first run able keep 
dogs therefore unloosed allowed range country 
started several hyenas killed others brought bay lads ran dispatched arrows others took flight sufficient time got safely away hyena unless overtaken start run long swiftly tire heavy dogs party 
walking fifteen miles lads stopped suddenly brow sandhill 
front wide expanse water bordered band vegetation 
long rushes aquatic plants formed band water edge huts patches cultivated ground dotted country

better us go near margin water air salubrious unaccustomed 
best hunting ground lies miles left river high floods come valley times wet marshy

chapter vi 
fowling fishing 
tents made light cloth intended keep night dews rather afford warmth soon pitched fires lighted fuel brought order save time searching rabah went search fish fowl 
returned half hour peasant carrying four ducks several fine fish 
shall said stag larder complete 
everything meat brought us 
chebron although kept bravely fatigued walk glad throw sand enjoy prospect new one never seen wide expanse water 
top hill made faint dark line distance rabah told bank sand separated lake great sea 
present position invisible nothing wide expanse water stretching away seemed touch sky met view 
dotted dark patches rabah told clumps waterfowl shallow water near margin quarter mile away could see vast numbers wading birds white cranes white black ibises numbers waterfowl looking like black specks moved briskly among 
sometimes loud cries number would rise wing either make straight line across water circle round settle found alarm groundless 
lovely exclaimed amuba standing beside leaning bow looking water 
amuba reply immediately chebron looking saw tears cheeks 
amuba asked anxiously 
nothing chebron sight wide water takes thoughts homeward 
city stood sea like large say great sea looking far large eye see across view looked upon daily walls palace save shores higher 
maybe see day amuba chebron said gently 
amuba shook head 
fear chances small indeed chebron 
jethro talked hundreds times route hither determined fell hands harsh masters would hazards try day make escape journey long would lie countries subject egypt 
people land passed speak languages strange us would well nigh impossible make journey safety 
still would tried 
well contented lot mad indeed forsake slender chances finding way back land rebu indeed even reached might well received knows king may reigning could get away sure arriving safely would exchange comforts civilized country like egypt life described among people doubt chebron life far luxurious far civilized rebu 
side palaces houses huts 
ignorant even reading writing 
pile rushes beds rough table stools constitute furniture perhaps one really happier things 
may enjoyments greater cares 
suppose every man loves country best think love much 
first place settled generations large numbers people constantly moving west either joining one peoples push past us far east beside wherever went take country us build houses like left behind live chase fishing one place another egyptians could nowhere find country like egypt 
suppose people country familiar language familiar faces ways 
grant freely egyptians far greater people powerful learned masters many arts owners many comforts luxuries yet one longs sometimes one free life among rebu 
one thing amuba prince 
common man born labor toil fight bidding king might perhaps find life even egyptian peasant easier pleasant 
may amuba said thoughtfully yet think poorest among us far freer independent richest egyptian peasants 
grovel ground king passed along 
open braver fellows rise rank 
could fish hunt till ground fashion arms chose life tied usage custom 
man poor one perhaps half savage one man egyptian peasants free may name slaves law custom 
see meal ready grand appetite 
amuba 
almost worth walking long way sake appetite one gets end 
meal excellent one 
one slaves brought adept cooking fish birds venison alike excellent vegetables formed large portion ordinary egyptian repast neglected 
going morrow rabah chebron asked meal concluded 
arranged morrow pleasure lord shall go fowling 
boat take along lake point three miles best sport day carry another eight miles place spoke good sport obtained 
shall meet landing everything readiness 
well chebron said 
amuba jethro course come 
soon daylight rabah led chebron lake lad amuba jethro entered boat constructed rushes covered pitch drew two three inches water 
two men long poles already boat fowlers profession skilled various devices waterfowl captured 
night preparing boat expedition fastening rushes round lower ends dipped water upper ends six feet rushes thickly placed together form impenetrable screen 
boat square stern opening inches wide rushes enable boatman standing propel boat pole 
one men took station bow peered little opening rushes directed comrade stern course take 
bottom boat lay two cats knowing part presently come watched done air intelligent interest 
basket well stored provisions jar wine placed board boat pushed noiselessly 
parting reeds fingers peeping boys saw boat making deeper part lake skirting edge keeping yards band rushes margin 
keep distance way chebron asked man pole 
man nodded 
long close rushes waterfowl notice approach push middle might take alarm although often capture way case get windward flock want reach drift slowly upon shall get sport keeping close 
birds numerous soon work 
five minutes man bow motioned passengers approaching flock waterfowl 
took bow arrows stood readiness man stern used pole even quickly silently 
presently signal comrades ceased poling 
round boat slight sounds low contented quackings fluttering wings birds raised shook water backs 
parting rushes front two lads jethro peeped 
right middle flock wildfowl feeding without thought danger clump rushes midst 
arrows already notches rushes parted little three shafts loosed 
twangs bows startled ducks stopping feeding gazed rushes heads one side 
three arrows glanced time one birds aimed wounded uttering cry pain terror flapped along surface water

instantly wild cries alarm whole flock arose fairly settled flight two fell pierced arrows 
cats standing alert cry alarm given leaped overboard stern proceeded pick dead ducks among included first flown away dropped water fifty yards boat 
dozen times scene repeated three score ducks geese lay bottom boat 
time party enough sport indeed lost greater part arrows failed strike bird aimed went far deep mud bottom could recovered 
let men show us skill throwing sticks chebron said 
see better arrows 
men turned boat head toward patch rushes growing shallow water hundred yards lake 
numbers ducks geese feeding round whole rushes movement swimming feeding among plants time seed 
birds much occupied mark approach fresh clump rushes 
men removed screen side boat furthest birds stood readiness holding half dozen sticks two feet long made curved crooked wood 
close birds boat swung round deafening cries birds rose men great rapidity hurled sticks one another among last directed birds feeding among rushes able rise rapidly companions 
lads astonished effect produced simple missiles 
closely packed birds stick striking one whirled twisted among others one missile frequently bringing three four birds 
cats instant work 
flapping noise prodigious although many birds killed outright others struck wing leg slightly injured 
made along surface water others succeeded getting flying away greater part either killed cats knocked head poles two fowlers 
altogether twenty seven birds added store boat 
puts arrows shame altogether amuba chebron said 
always heard fowlers lakes skilled throwing sticks could believed possible two men short space effected slaughter idea enormous quantities birds lakes 
jethro examining sticks well ducks retrieved cats 
curious things said amuba 
thinking men used straight sticks would much better wondering chose curved wood doubt shape something 
see men threw gave strong spinning motion 
seems secret action 
wonderful see whirled among fowl striking one head another leg another wing happened hit one plump body seemed stop 
sure one sticks kept eyes fixed must knocked six birds 
practice things ever get back home teach use people 
almost many waterfowl sea 
seen almost black southern end bordered swamps reed covered marshes 
catch jethro chebron asked 
net decoys sometimes wade among heads hidden among floating boughs get near enough seize legs pull water way man catch score comrades wiser 
catch way one fowlers listening remarked 
weave little bowers large enough heads shoulders go leave three four floating days near spot mean work 
wild fowl get accustomed easily go among capture numbers 
think fowling must good trade chebron said 
good enough times man replied ducks year 
long legged birds always found numbers ducks uncertain geese 
certain times year leave us altogether 
say go across great sea north others go far south nubia 
even uncertain 
sometimes thick scarce one seen hear swarming lakes west 
course wading birds use food see ducks geese scarce hard time 
even got boat load long way take market weather hot may get spoiled sell price low parts flocks hard lay enough money keep us families slack time 
great cities thebes memphis lay near us would different 
could consume could catch get better prices unless favorable circumstances hope fowl keeping good long passage river thebes 
fact decoys starve 
course take alive send baskets thebes way get fair price 
sort decoys use jethro asked 
many kinds man replied 
sometimes arch rushes tie together top form long passages little channels among rushes strew corn water place near entrance ducks trained swim outside flock comes near enter passage feeding others follow 
sort door push aside easily pass open return 
sort decoy use country jethro said 
another way fowler went choose spot rushes form thick screen twenty yards deep along bank light net two three hundred feet long pegged shore behind thrown tops rushes reaching within foot two water 
rolled shaken go water 
two men stand among rushes ends net another goes far lake boat 
sees flock ducks swimming near shore poles boat toward rapidly frighten taking flight enough attract attention cause uneasiness 
goes backward forward gradually approaching shore course managing drive toward point net 
opposite closes faster ducks swim among rushes 
directly men ends net shake rolled part whole flock prisoners 
fowlers enter rushes take try fly upward stopped net 
luck two three catches made day thousand ducks sometimes double number captured 
put flat baskets high enough stand heads openings top put board boat taken nile 
yes often seen baskets taken boats chebron said thought cruel pack closely 
feed must often fortnight way trader bought us fowlers waits got enough together freight large craft would pay work upon small scale accompanies river feeds regularly little balls made moistened flour way establishments upper egypt raise fowl stuff markets 
boat large one taking forty fifty thousand fowl course takes two three boys help light matter feed number must little water well meal 
seems strange us fowl abundant people raise feed bullocks 
suppose true 
quite true chebron replied 
amuba went one great breeding farms two three months ago 
two sorts one hatch fat 
one went embraced branches unusual 
hatching places collectors go round people keep fowls miles round bring eggs beside buy others greater distance 
eggs placed sand laid floor low chamber heated means flues fire underneath 
requires great care keep temperature exactly right course men pass lives work regulate exactly know feel heat eggs kept 
eight ten chambers place visited every two three days one hatches ready fresh eggs put 
people send eggs come proper time receive number chickens proportion eggs sent one chicken given two eggs 
hatchers give less remain payment work see careful hatching 
hatch ninety chickens every hundred eggs pays well owing heat great little twenty thirty every hundred raised make good loss 
course always put great many eggs bought 
thus able give right number customers even eggs turned well 
remain proper number given farmers breeders sell others part business bring chickens 
fattening business quite different 
places long rows little boxes piled wall five feet high 
door boxes hole fowl put head little sort shutter closes 
fowl placed bow 
attendants go around two together one carries basket filled little balls meal lifts shutter fowl puts head catches neck makes open beak hand pushes ball meal throat 
skillful operation takes scarce moment go next long rows fed last charge 
begin afresh 
keep dark fowler asked 
told us dark restless slept time meals 
time flap lifted think daylight pop heads see 
ten days get quite fat plump ready market 
seems wonderful deal trouble fowler said 
suppose fine market close hand get good prices pays 
seems reasonable hatching business 
let fowls hatch eggs imagine 
fowls lay vastly greater number eggs hatch chebron said 
well fed fowl lay two hundred fifty eggs year left hatch two broods fifteen eggs 
thus see pays peasants much better rear fowls sell eggs profit send eggs hatching places get hundred twenty five chickens year instead thirty 
suppose fowler agreed 
lord end journey 
point land servant hired us standing readiness 
hope satisfied day sport 
chebron said greatly pleased minutes boat reached landing place rabah awaiting 
one fowlers carrying dozen finest fowl killed accompanied spot rabah chosen encampment 
like last stood foot sandhills hundred yards lake 
place going hunt near chebron first question 
lord two miles away 
accordance order last night arranged fish morrow 
afternoon move tents mile nearer country hunt best go close near edge great swamps air unhealthy accustomed 
long get hunting chebron said better say day fishing first work would seem tame excitement hunting river horse 
shall glad dinner soon get although done justice food put board quite ready 
twelve hours fresh air sea gives one appetite hyena 
everything already readiness lord 
thought better wait game brought home well morrow purchased fish fowl peasants 
seen boat last two three hours able calculate time arrival thus everything readiness 
dinner similar previous day except hare took place venison change better hare delicacy much appreciated egyptians 
following day spent fishing 
purpose long net used method precisely similar use modern times 
one end net fastened shore net coiled boat 
rowed lake fishermen paying net went 
circuit made back shore men seized two ends net hauled land capturing fish inclosed within sweep 
seeing two three hauls made lads went jethro board boat 
provided fishermen long two pronged spears 
boat quietly rowed along edge rushes water deeper usual 
however clear could see bottom spears struck fish swimming 
first uniformly unsuccessful ignorant allowance must made diffraction puzzled finding spears instead going straight fish struck seemed bend angle water edge 
fishermen however explained allowance must made allowance greater greater distance fish boat lay precisely could strike directly 
even instructed matter succeeded poorly presently laid spears contented watching boatmen rarely failed striking bringing prey aimed 
presently attention attracted four boats containing six eight men 
two come either direction neared volleys abuse exchanged occupants 
chebron asked two fishermen laid spears faces full excitement turned round watch boats 
boats come two villages lord present feud arising fishing nets carried away 
sent regular challenge days since custom champions going fight 
see number men one side equal boats size 
amuba jethro looked great interest seen painted walls representations fights boatmen common occurrence egyptians combative race fierce feuds often carried long time neighboring villages 
men armed poles ten feet length inch half diameter favorite weapons occasions kind 
boats come close contact furious battle commenced clattering sticks heavy thuds blows shouts combatants creating clamor caused waterfowl within circle half mile fly screaming away across lake 
men used heavy weapons considerable ability greater part blows warded 
many however took effect combatants knocked water others fell prostrate boats dropped long staves disabling blow arm 
marvelous kill jethro said 
surely shaving head amuba always struck us peculiar uses must tend thicken skull surely heads men could borne blows without crushed like water jars 
certainly ground jethro supposition proved fact herodotus long afterward writing desperate conflicts villagers egypt asserted skulls thicker people 
men fell water scrambled back boats renewed fight sank immediately seen 
last fully half men side put hors de combat four five killed drowned boats separated advantage resting either party still shouting defiance jeers men poled direction respective villages 
desperate fights common chebron asked fishermen 
yes often quarrels one replied quietly resuming fishing nothing ordinary way taken place 
water side villages champions fight boats seen equal parties meet spot halfway villages decide foot 
sometimes fight short sticks hand protected basket hilt left arm piece wood extending elbow tips fingers fastened straps serving shield usually fight long pole call neboot 
fine weapon jethro said guard heads admirably sliding hands far apart 
back amuba like organize regiment men armed weapons 
would need part used guard covered light iron prevent sword ax cutting addition would make splendid weapons footmen armed sword shield would find hard indeed repel assault 
drawback would amuba observed man would require much room wield weapon must stand far apart would opposed three four swordsmen enemy line 
true amuba certainly hit upon weak point use weapon single combat fighting broken ranks would grand 
get back thebes find peasant instruct use neboots certainly learn 
ought make fine player one fishermen said looking jethro powerful figure 
like crack head neboot hands 
sun getting low best moving point disembark 
another capital day rabah chebron said reached new encampment 
hope rest turn successful 
think promise lord 
making inquiries among villagers find swamp river bed abounds hippopotami 
hunt foot lord 
enough water river bed flat boats made bundles rushes pass many places deep pools animals lie heat day 
ferocious animals amuba asked 
never yet seen one though say common upper nile well found swamps like mouth none anywhere neighborhood thebes 
suppose much traffic afraid showing water 
would food rabah said 
found swamps like places upper nile river shallow bordered aquatic plants whose roots principally live 
timid creatures found little frequented places 
struck generally try make escape although occasionally rush enormous mouth open boat tear pieces kill hunter seldom happens 
rule try fly 
must cowardly beasts jethro said scornfully 
would rather hunt animal ever small make fight life 
however shall see 
upon following morning started scene action 
exclamation surprise broke simultaneously ascending sandhill saw plain mile wide extending feet 
covered rushes aquatic plants extended south far eye could see 
one month year rabah said river eleven little swamp though shallower boats make way many miles 
little water always finds way either nile canals 
one places northern egypt river horse still found none allowed hunt unless sufficient rank obtain permission governor province 
steward wrote obtained soon knew letter father accompanying would desire sport 
crocodiles amuba asked 
many rabah replied although found lakes 
people like theban zone hold high respect regard dangerous enemies kill without mercy 
chapter vii 
hippopotamus crocodile 
guided rabah party descended edge swamp 
shallow water lay three boats rather rafts constructed bundles bulrushes 
turned front form sort swan necked bow outline exactly similar iron modern skates 
upon stood native pole pushing rafts along three four spears 
unusual shape lads examined curiosity 
broad short blades loosely attached shafts animal struck shaft would drop leaving head imbedded flesh 
head attached cord wound spindle passing handle 
rafts look would carry three chebron said 
push man replied better two 
stop onshore permission chebron jethro said 
see number men ropes 
suppose something business accompany 
ropes hauling beasts ashore struck 
well go help pull 
share use one little rafts indeed think weight would bury water 
morning lord boatman said addressing chebron found river horse lying pool mile river 
think large one give us good sport 
chebron amuba took places two rafts men laying spears taking poles pushed shore 
noiselessly made way among rushes 
sometimes channels narrow reeds almost brushed rafts sides opened wide pools water deepened much poles could scarce touch bottom 
word spoken men warned slightest noise would scare hippopotami cause sink bottom pools would difficult capture 
half hour poling reached pool larger hitherto passed extending one side almost bank river 
man raft signed chebron take one spears lad shook head motioned undertake attack felt ignorant habits animal would folly engage adventure 
man nodded indeed doubting course affair would take needed thrust powerful arm drive spear thick hide hippopotamus 
amuba imitated chebron example preferring spectator instead actor unknown sport 
three four minutes boats lay motionless blowing sound heard boatman pointed seemed boys two lumps black mud projecting inch two water near margin rushes 
could believed formed part animal slight ripples widening glassy water showed movement spot indicated 
noiseless push chebron hunter sent boat direction handed end pole chebron signing push boat back gave signal 
within ten yards two little black patches sudden movement widened enormous head huge beast rose feet startled discovery made men close hand 
instant hunter hurled spear force 
tough animal hide sharp head cut way 
roar beast plunged rushes shaft spear falling socket strong cord ran rapidly reel held hunter 
presently strain ceased 
laid shelter hunter said follow give second spear 
pushing rushes aside boat forced along caught sight hippopotamus standing belly water 
going charge chebron asked grasping spear 
little chance 
upset boat throw among rushes lie face water 
divert attention come back get boat made 
another spear thrown good effect 
roar great splash 
chebron thought animal upon turned dashed back pool first lying 
thought would hunter said 
always seek shelter bottom deep pools see water deep enough cover 
boat followed hippopotamus 
amuba still raft pool 
become chebron asked passed beyond rushes 
sunk bottom pool amuba replied 
gave start tell 
heard bursting rushes rushed mouth open mouth like cavern thought going charge us turned sank bottom pool 
long lie chebron asked hunter 
long time left going stir 
saying directed boat toward rushes nearest bank pushed boat 
oh jethro chebron said seeing rebu men accompanied standing bank 
happened chebron killed one heard sort roar great splashing 
killed two spear heads sticking 
hunter handed cords men told pull steadily hard enough break cords 
took end rope carried poled back pool 
cords strong enough pull great beast shore chebron asked 
oh would move pulling causes spear heads give pain gets uneasy rises surface anger 
see throw noose head pull upon 
two three minutes animal head appeared water 
instant hunter threw noose 
aim correct jerk tightened round neck 
pull shouted 
peasants pulled gradually hippopotamus drawn toward bank although struggling swim opposite direction 
soon however reached shallow water feet touched ground threw whole weight upon rope 
peasants thrown ground rope dragged fingers hippopotamus made way bottom pool 
peasants regained feet pulled rope cords 
hippopotamus rose dragged shallow break away 
eight ten times happened 
getting tired hunter said 
next time time get shore 
land attack spears arrows 
hippopotamus indeed exhausted allowed dragged ashore next effort without opposition 
soon attacked spears hunters jethro boys 
latter found unable drive weapons thick skin betook bows arrows 
hunters however knew points skin thinnest drove spears deep animal behind fore leg boys shot arrows mouth 
another noose thrown head issued water peasants pulling ropes prevented charging 
three four thrusts given hunters one spears touched vital part hippopotamus sank knees rolled dead 
peasants sent shout joy flesh hippopotamus means bad eating store food sufficient whole neighborhood 
shall search another lord hunter asked chebron 

think enough 
fun killing animal spirit defend 
think amuba quite agree chebron 
one might almost well slaughter cow 
exclaimed suddenly loud scream heard short distance away 
woman voice 
chebron darted full speed direction sound closely followed amuba jethro 
ran hundred yards along bank saw cause outcry 
immense crocodile making way toward river dragging along figure woman 
spite reverence crocodile chebron hesitate moment rushing forward smote crocodile nose strength shaft spear 
crocodile dropped victim turned upon assailant jethro amuba close behind also attacked 
crocodile seeing accession enemies set river snapping jaws together 
mind tail one hunters exclaimed running 
warning late next moment amuba received tremendous blow sent ground 
hunter moment plunged spear animal soft skin back leg 
jethro followed example side 
animal checked flight turning round round lashed tail directions 
keep clear hunter shouted 
mortally wounded need blows 
fact crocodile received death wound 
movements became languid ceased lash tail though still snapped nearest gradually action also ceased head sank dead 
jethro soon delivered blow ran amuba 
hurt asked anxiously 
think amuba gasped 
brute knocked breath body better hit leg think would broken done 
woman dead time see jethro replied 
let help feet let us see ribs broken 
see afterward 
amuba getting declared think seriously hurt although unable time stand upright 
expect bruised jethro 
certainly tremendous whack gave expect shall able take part sporting next days 
crocodile worth dozen hippopotami 
courage 
walked across chebron stooping figure crocodile victim 
girl amuba exclaimed 
older sister chebron 
think dead chebron asked hushed tones 
think fainted jethro replied 
shouted one peasants gathered round crocodile one run water bring gourdful 
think dead amuba said 
seemed crocodile seized leg 
must carry somewhere jethro said get woman attend 
see hut near

cottage close hand said returned 
dare say belongs 
bidding two peasants run fetch women lifted slight figure carried slope two lads following 
turning round foot sandhill saw cottage lying nestled behind

eight women class paid mourners came along beating breasts throwing dust upon heads uttering loud lamentations 
ameres clad leopard skin hands censer vase libation accompanied attendants bearing various implements used services followed number priests also clad leopard skins came along 
immediately behind followed consecrated boat placed upon sledge containing mummy case large exterior case covered paintings

procession reformed went order tomb 
mummy case placed slab prepared sacrifice libation incense offered 
door tomb closed fastened sacrificial services would held periodically many years 
procession returned foot house 
time certain clew obtained authors murder 
upon going temple day neco death chebron found sorts rumors current 
affair previous night greatly magnified generally believed strong party men entered temple intention carrying sacred vessels disturbed going break subterranean apartments kept fled ladders escaped wall sufficient force could collected detain 
generally supposed affair way connected death neco 
upon chebron return news amuba agreed necessary inform ameres doings previous night 
evening meal ameres called chebron study 
heard aught temple chebron strange affair took place last night see connection brother death still strange 
heard first discovered thieves last night say ptylus though hour know 
four five others named priests aroused curiously one temple day 
received letter ptylus saying suddenly called visit relations living seashore near mouths nile 
others sent similar excuses 
sent houses appear left early hour morning 
strange none notified yesterday occasion absent 
motive thus running away naturally would obtain praise honor saved vessels temple heard anything would seem throw light upon subject heard nothing father tell much 
spoken first thing morning news neco 
chebron related ameres amuba night visited temple ascended stairs behind image god overheard plot murder unknown person 
extraordinary tale chebron ameres said brought story conclusion 
certainly would slain overtaken 
door led staircase came open imagine 
place used rare occasions deemed absolutely necessary influence one direction another course events 
suppose last used months since door must carelessly fastened opened 
still minor matter fortunate made discovery 
conspiracy say overheard much serious 
mind sudden absence ptylus others would seem show conscious guilt 
presence temple late singular say know much conversation overheard 
plot directed form idea though doubtless personage high importance 
think father chebron said hesitatingly plot could murder neco amuba thought talked afternoon 
think ameres said pause 
hardly likely four five persons would plot together carry murder one position must one far greater importance 
neco may liked certainly held esteem priests temple 
see father chebron said ptylus ambitious man may hoped time become high priest 
neco would stood way office hereditary eldest son fitted undertake neco would almost certainly selected 
true chebron reason credit ptylus wickedness beside would hardly take people confidence entertain scheme 
moreover knowing overheard last night although tell much may gathered listener would assuredly carried plan execution besides say plan arrived whole temple disturbed would hardly met afterward arranged fresh scheme murder 

neco killed must suspected one overheard 
figure unlike 
may probably obtained glimpse walls noticed priest attire 
temple late probably left discovered 
believing overheard thinking one listeners neco decided safety remove 
course mere assumption ptylus one overheard last night 
absence day thing alone wholly insufficient enable us move matter 
whole affair terrible mystery assured best unravel 
present case nothing 
ptylus four priests absent doubtless return find accusation laid 
suppose person overheard whoever either afraid come forward perhaps heard words ignorant identity speakers 
indeed would bold man would venture prefer terrible accusation five priests temple 
blame matter could foreseen events happened 
gods learned learned perhaps intend day shall instrument bringing guilty justice 
conspiracy doubt say plot whomsoever directed abandoned never sure much known passed whether overheard may waiting commission crown denounce

however think idea committed act horrible sacrilege fear death weighs 
serious matter one could almost laugh one crushed earth accidentally killed cat 
upon entering house chebron made way room father engaged study

amuba killed hawk arrow struck tree flew wide mark entering cats house killed paucis chosen two days take place sacred cat temple bubastes 
exclamation horror broke high priest recoiled pace son 
unhappy boy said life indeed forfeited 
king could save son fury populace perpetrated deed 
life thinking father chebron said first horrible sacrilege alone bear consequences must fall upon mother sister even related one committed crime terrible disgrace 
ameres walked room several times spoke 
share consequences chebron must bear best said last calmer tone used must first think 
terrible affair yet say accident guiltless intentional sacrilege 
plea nothing 
death punishment slaying cat one slain chosen succeed cat bubastes others one sacred 
question done must fly instantly though fear flight vain soon news known spread one end egypt every man hand even time discovery may made 
hardly father amuba buried cat among bushes left door house open may supposed time wandered away

still would one expect man like father high priest gods 
father wise well learned man jethro said knows gods altogether offended affair fate slayer responsible 
real slayer cat twig turned arrow see blame anything like much blame hawk shot 
however consolation chebron threw couch state complete prostration 
seemed even could terrible thing hidden must denounce bear penalty 
could exist knowledge ban gods life would curse rather gift circumstances 
physically chebron coward toughness mental fiber enables men bear almost unmoved misfortunes would crush others ground 
comforting assurances amuba jethro failed give slightest consolation 
loved amuba brother matters opinion would weighed greatly amuba knew nothing gods egypt could feel slightest terrible nature act sacrilege therefore point opinion could weight 
jethro amuba said told going escort mysa one day top hills order could thence look upon whole city

unfortunately share greater trouble feeling horror regard sacrilege rebu hold life one animal sacred life another hesitation shooting cat deer 
surely gods powerful egypt impotent elsewhere yet powerful vengeance fallen upon peoples slay without hesitation animals dear often wondered chebron said falling readily snare amuba many conversations subjects points constantly presenting unable solve 
hour later servant entered told chebron amuba ameres wished speak former recovered extent nervous excitement first suffered 
two lads bowed respectfully high priest standing submissively waited address 
sent said pause seems although amuba concerned sad business probable engaged time popular fury might nicely discriminate 
paused expecting reply amuba said quietly saying chebron lord 
consider fully guilty 
mere accident arrow mine turned aside mark aimed ready share lot whether decide truth shall published whether attempt fly 
ameres bowed head gravely looked son 
father although ready yield wishes obey matters would beseech allow denounce bear fate 
feel would infinitely rather die live terrible weight guilt upon head 
expected much chebron applaud decision ameres said gravely 
chebron face brightened amuba fell 
ameres pause went think chebron accidental killing cat deadly offense gods say denounce consider 
chebron gazed father could scarce credit sense hearing even amuba looked surprised 
frequently asked questions chebron either turned aside refused answer 
indeed seeing inherited spirit inquiry deemed best ascend highest order priesthood knowledge would acquire would render rendered dissatisfied state things around 
unfortunate accident never spoken subject feel duty tell 
hard struggle since left thought every point view ought 
one hand tell things known inner circle things known whispered one life would forfeited

chebron amuba listened awestruck silence words high priest

thought first told overheard possibly plot life

opposite effect

storm burst populace town become thoroughly imbued idea sacred cat slain outburst fanatical rage time carry

jethro tell prepared worst 
dear father

noble father killed base cowardly mob urged villains priesthood 
chebron threw one couches wept bitterly amuba almost deeply affected ameres behaved kindness father 
following morning chebron sufficiently recovered ask jethro relate details father death

went gate 
got fell crowd people rushed 
two three gardeners run could nothing stop 
reached house father came portico said good people front silent moment abashed presence calm manner spoke others behind set cry sacred cat find others shouted impious priest ameres replied search place though indeed seems need permission seeing taken matter hands 
pray enter house

cry raised let us search garden struck two parties among mob one ignorant bigoted believing really offense committed gods men kept background moving spirits 
pleased saw crowd readily abandon idea searching house scatter garden seemed one gardeners others might obtained sort clew might put road discovery 
saw several among crowd dogs trained chase made uneasy 
told one men run summon troops followed crowd 
uneasy see without wasting time searching elsewhere made straight inclosure animals kept 
sooner get began search urging dogs assist 
suddenly started touch upon shoulder looking round saw ameres 
remember instructions jethro said quiet voice commit chebron charge 
oh lord exclaimed troops short distance away

offended gods ever wronged one countrymen 
fly moment yell rage among crowd knew one accursed hounds must smelled dead cat scratched earth

death eyes rushing toward shouting despiser gods slayer sacred cat seeing rushed 
confusion

late besides pursuers close behind without pause took road farm 
think tell 
chebron weeping bitterly amuba deeply affected went 
console chebron 
know feeling blame greatly calamity 
know father said accident doubtless great god arrow fly declared believed result conspiracy heard temple men determined take life 
minutes later embalmer entered bringing food 
saw chebron informed fate befallen father 
heard aught passing city amuba asked 
yes chigron answered naught else talked 
many concerned deed escaped either entrance soldiers arrived walls many seized prison sacrilegious deed raising hand person high priest osiris 
tumults city night many maintaining deed well done others contrary 
taken declared informed one said knew certain cat buried inclosure slain young lord seen going bows arrows inclosure time cat never seen 
general opinion though prisoners taken punished flogging death lives also assuredly forfeited even friendship king father would avail protect like others must obey law law egypt whomsoever shall take life cat shall slain 
perfectly willing die chebron said greatest regret follow first impulse denounce accidental killer cat 
blame could attached father 
disgrace would fallen upon whole family embalmer said nearly related one performed impious action must needs suffer 
blame chebron know father 
told arranged needs furnish hiding place although might need refuge would fault 
understand could said seeing terrible guilt even accidentally taking life cat specially cat sacred others land 
still know father wisdom equaled goodness although understand saying content accept power save 
doubtless search hot one must hope best 
go see jethro said 
may safe move away remain 
case embalmer said need disguised start 
known ameres two fair skinned slaves one concerned young lord matter also fighting furiously garden heard slaying several master enemies managed make escape 
fortunately materials hand 
use paints stains abundance sere clothes dead decorations coffins easily make dark people 
one wigs egyptian garments alter long look one fairly face fear whatever discovery must look even blackened lashes lightness eyes would betray 
half hour jethro transformed middle class citizen thebes started mission inquiry 
day officials came establishment made many inquiries missing lads 
contented denials went whole buildings examining chambers closely 
known said chigron several times came ameres patron 
duty search house shelter might given though hardly believe one would hold communication far less receive house persons guilty act sacrilege 
however chance escaping us 
messages sent egypt 
moreover horses gone far 
first house searched servants say son ameres frequently 
frequently chigron replied though certainly came sometimes interested watching various processes 
chebron fact several times embalmer amuba accompanied although would preferred staying away whole scene repulsive 
chebron temperament differed however widely friend 
dead sacred egypt rites ceremonies connected bore religious character 
fear death deemed sleep would last three thousand years 
reason bodies human beings sacred animals carefully embalmed laid away either massive tombs rock hewn caverns 
believed proved rightly remains carefully prepared would endure time thought spirit returned would resume former shape particulars 
thus dead ranks embalmed process however case wealthy differing widely bodies poorer classes submitted 
many kinds embalming varying according means family deceased 
process employed wealthy long expensive one 
first official called scribe marked side corpse aperture made cut another person fled pursued execrations pelted stones although necessary operation considered dishonorable one injury sacred body

amuba gifted strong imagination saw whole matter merely preservation body opinion much better either buried placed funeral pile destroyed fire visits embalmers constituted unpleasant part duties chebron companion 
jethro anticipated left visit city would short duration return hour latest day passed night fell without return lads became exceedingly anxious feared something serious taken place detain 
either disguise detected seized populace great misfortune must befallen 
arranged indeed night started upon journey jethro return made list articles deemed necessary flight chigron promised purchase 
plans however completely upset nonappearance late afternoon chigron went city ascertain could jethro discovered name associated boys 
believed indeed taken actual part slaying cat deemed certain close connection disappearance shortly time suddenly left farm league 
chigron returned news far could learn nothing heard jethro 
subject talked city event previous day indignation people equally divided murderers ameres slayers sacred cat 
boys full grief perplexity 
amuba jethro taken place elder brother 
cheered darkest moment life friend companion ever since thought ill might befallen filled sorrow 
mingled intense anxiety future 
without jethro strong arm advice terrible journey accomplished chebron state either act plan 
deep depression seized upon cared whether escaped would indeed hailed detection death boons 
intense therefore amuba relief late evening footstep heard outer chamber jethro entered 
sprang feet cry gladness 
oh jethro thank gods returned 
suffered terribly account 
happened long delayed return fresh trouble jethro replied stern voice 
fresh trouble jethro way even chebron scarcely sat languidly couch jethro entrance looked interest jethro answer 
mysa carried replied grimly 
chebron sprang feet 
devoted sister moment new calamity effaced remembrance preceded 
mysa carried exclaimed moment amuba 
done done learn questions broke quickly lads 
leaving went arranged city jethro replied 
difficulty learning learn business seemed suspended streets full groups people talking events yesterday 
whole city shaken fact two terrible acts sacrilege slaying sacred cat bubastes murder high priest osiris taken place within short time 
prophesy terrible calamity befall land offended gods way wreak vengeance upon 
royal order issued enjoining men search arrest every person concerned murder ameres doubtless severest penalties dealt 
decree orders arrest wherever found enjoins upon officials throughout kingdom keep strict watch towns villages examine strangers may present send hither bound chains young men may fail give satisfactory account 
sacrifices offered temples throughout land appease wrath gods 
messengers dispatched directions provinces seemed consider certain hours hiding place would discovered 
made sure made either seacoast desert one side messengers would reach coast long could considered impossible us get unnoticed 
went house intending go simply see neighborhood heard news 
gates open quite crowd people passing gratify curiosity gazing scene 
relying upon disguise went rest 
none entered house guard soldiers stationed 
passed round back presently lyptis old female slave came fetch water 
spoke assumed character shook head made reply 
believing like others house attached family could trusted spoke natural voice knew

tears streaming face 
oh jethro exclaimed gods ever hurl calamities upon household dear master dead lord chebron hunted men hunt wild beast dear young mistress mysa missing missing exclaimed 
mean heard said 
heard nothing cried 
tell gates beaten crowd rushed along garden four men burst house ran chamber chamber entered young mistress 
heard scream moment later came bearing figure enveloped wrapping 
strove stop naught women house 
struck two us ground rushed 
us ran garden crying aid saw terrible scene 
great struggle going presently broke forth covered blood wounds ran swiftly past 
none heeded us cries 
soldiers arrived told officer happened late nothing could done 
guard house things would never happened 
asked could describe appearance men 
said attired respectable citizens language manner believed ruffians lowest class

quite sure said 
one bore figure three cleared way

however learned went streets 
chapter xiii 
search mysa 
perhaps ruth gone tell mother mysa lost chebron suggested jethro gone far story 
could hardly jethro replied told mother returned early morning house many relatives weeping mourning round body father 
ruth gone would either returned lyptis would heard 
hear mother bore misfortunes jethro overwhelmed grief lyptis said father death overwhelmed seemed thought anything else 
course told night mysa missing seemed make impression upon 
said doubtless friends carried save danger chebron wickedness brought upon us 
morning made inquiries seem serious alarm magistrates came last night inquire whole matter took note mysa carried coming morning found nothing heard gave orders search made proclamation issued afternoon denouncing punishment carried enjoining could give information subject present immediately 
since came house wandering trying think best done hoping something might occur would put upon track villains carried mysa 
think carrying plans morrow jethro chebron asked anxiously 
could never go away ignorance become 
certainly chebron 
consider duty well inclination stay found 
father spoke well see way could aid said must take chance meaning take chance guardianship mother obtain day husband could love 
present misfortune entirely alters case 
need active help whatever risks must postpone start 
whether able stay doubtful 
day passes without news received capture provinces north us increase belief hiding somewhere neighborhood city case search become earnest 
however day two may safe 
though must abide chigron opinion 
running small risk concealing us considers danger becoming greater willing run must betake hills 
lonely spots could lie concealed long time least long supplies food water could carry us hold 
rate must set aside thought flight present devote energies discovery rescue mysa 
think far look contrivers outrage amuba said 
seems piece whole misfortunes befallen us 
know ameres refused request ptylus mysa wife son 
came plot overheard temple murder one 
knowledge overheard put stop scheme 
came stirring people partly story unfortunate cat partly whispers ameres although high priest osiris yet scorner gods 
came attack upon house main body mob attacked ameres chosen band carried mysa 
villain ptylus several motives spur 
first place anger rejection son suit next would death ameres naturally succeed high priesthood thirdly may thought could obtain possession mysa marry son would bring small portion father lands dowry 
influence high priest would king council could rely upon obtaining share estate especially villain would calculate chebron well father would put way 
keep mysa immured power high priest consolidated gain consent king match mysa could refuse accept fate prepared 
think accurately reasoned case amuba penetrated whole conspiracy 
question must jethro chebron cried excitedly pacing chamber 
mysa bear plexo 
spoke something like horror heard proposal ptylus made 
like 
thin lipped crafty cruel 
mysa better dead married 
think promise chebron jethro said grimly marriage shall never come 
may find mysa may hidden either ptylus house one many chambers temple caves near rate find plexo leave egypt slay well father regard murderer ameres 
may able get away case must journey alone going quit egypt leave enjoy gains crime 
finished speaking chigron entered 
coming see jethro returned 
told reasons prolonged absence abduction mysa determination remain search place concealment 
shook head 
rash resolution 
even free come go choose chance finding hiding place would small indeed hunted quest seems absolutely hopeless one 
remaining long think would madness 
say 
first place many men employed coming going would sure noticed one second place cave would scarcely escape search second time 
workmen could conceal house saw men search approaching could place one inner casings mummies put two three casings 
lying would among number corpses similar state advancement toward burial none would think opening cases 
many people would well nigh impossible without observation unless indeed search made night workmen departed would hardly likely happen 
therefore think impossible stay another day two many caves burial places higher hillside might concealed 
many sarcophagi 
choose one several coffins remove mummies casings another cave party searchers approach place lie sarcophagus lower lid upon 
would sacrilege move dead chebron said shudder 
would sacrilege others chigron replied us whose business duty handle dead 
replace mummies cases left none worse temporary removal 
necessary course signs habitation cave nothing excite suspicions disturbed 
think good plan jethro said 
make sleeping places open air near 
shall sleep open air journey would hardship begin 
think best remove one caves 
never saying searchers may therefore chigron early daybreak go choose cave make arrangements 
think indeed best plan embalmer agreed 
course take care bring every night store provisions 
leave sleep 
long however occupants chamber threw upon piles rushes 
sometimes talked mysa discussed possible plans discovering concealed 
wondered become ruth would friendless great city might money sufficient buy meal 
ornaments jethro said silver bracelet mysa gave always wore 
two silver necklaces earrings 
think handed mother seemed good would fetch money 
ruth shrewd little maid though fifteen years old long accustomed manage house look grandfather 
run away think except perhaps noise tumult thought going killed 
even case would probably found way back morning sooner 
help thinking chebron said followed mysa 
although many months sure fond 
certainly jethro said 
often thought walking behind pretty see together 
mysa knew much everything yet hebrew maid gave opinion decidedly mysa listened talked grave way elder sister 
think might followed hope may 
case women must seen 
women scared senses chebron said doubt screaming wringing hands attending nothing else 
could sure ruth mysa feel less anxious certain would comfort support 
would indeed jethro agreed 
moreover greater hopes finding concealed possible get away spread alarm sure ruth would seize first opportunity promptly 
short time lay chigron entered said morning beginning break 
rose followed 
led along foot hill distance turning began ascend spot sloped gradually 
passed many tombs partly erected masonry partly cut rock behind walking fully half hour stopped entrance one 
one thought suitable purpose said 
one lonely little likelihood chance passer coming near 
second place know stone door rolls across entrance cemented place 
know indeed tomb belongs 
last mummy placed short time back son man buried told cemented wife grievously sick feared would shortly follow father 
therefore difficulty effecting entry 
second place hard small tomb cut rock left owners changing minds larger tomb made lower hill 
nothing beyond chamber narrow entrance made hide mummies chamber heap stones earth entrance none would suspect existence 
nothing could better jethro said 
let us set work prepare 
stone across entrance tomb three feet high width pushed back without difficulty entered 
four wooden sarcophagi stood 
jethro aided chigron opening three 
mummies cases taken outer cases opened replaced coffins mummies inner cases removed 
carried unfinished tomb fifty yards away deposited 
stones piled together conceal entrance men returned tomb 
perfectly safe chigron said 
keep stone rolled back unless see one approaching would sure make considerable number searchers mounting hillside long reach 
see course close door enter one sarcophagi lie inner case close lid sarcophagus place lid inner case 
think unlikely extreme search made rate search untenanted tombs 
fact stone left uncemented mere accident probably known owner 
extreme resource could need take hiding places 
far passers concerned might remain outside altogether case would run risk noticed 
may sure hills closely scanned figures seen moving party might set see whether fugitives eagerly sought 
therefore say daytime keep concealed 
soon dark course issue pass night wherever may think fit 
illustration c b hiding place chebron friends 
page 
shall certainly follow advice jethro said 
undoubtedly plan propose far safest 
think much chance earnest search made among tombs though likely enough may visit open empty say would never dream examining tombs use would naturally suppose securely fastened 
case worst coffins us betake assuredly one would think examining 
come chigron said soon dark give provisions days together peasants dresses prepared money ameres committed charge 
likely anything occur decide make move suddenly best everything readiness occasion possibly arise 
come morrow night well hour sunset 
name time exactly order sleep distance away hour meet leave protection gods 
evening shall dismantle chamber used remove signs inhabited 
chebron thanked embalmer earnestly kindness shown trouble taken risk run behalf 
would done could chigron said 
father son highest claims upon half fortune would spend carry last wishes ameres expressed 
soon embalmer left three friends sat within entrance tomb looking quiet city lying plain 
wish peasant dresses chebron said might go join search mysa 
would dangerous jethro said decidedly 
many seen taking part services procession chance passing unnoticed 
amuba less likely detected skin stained eyebrows blackened head shaved might manage pass providing walked eyes fixed ground way would much chance coming upon traces mysa 
search make must night 
shall day station near house ptylus 
expect gain information gazing high wall surrounds follow closely without attracting observation slaves servants may come especially two issue forth together may catch words talk possibly gather clew mystery 
still chance small must look forward way returning news 
wish jethro chebron said possible would go house see old woman get bring suit priests garments could night enter temple wander unquestioned chambers courts 
nights dark unless pass close lamp none could recognize 
overheard one conversation importance may could overhear another 
would danger attempt jethro said doubtfully 
matters chebron exclaimed impetuously 
trouble come upon us even slight risk would willing face truth think chance whatever recognized 
see often amuba went though nights always moonlit never addressed noticed amuba one regular attendants temple alone right penetrate beyond great courts 
jethro said 
shall explore temple amuba search every cavern hills 
many great tombs behind temple selected hiding place ptylus may chosen one place concealment mysa 
many tombs built princes nobles wealthy priests reception death could turned comfortable dwelling 
spent time searching must unsuccessful try away 
ptylus doubt like ameres farms country residences may hidden one 
believe amuba said better plan us establish watch plexo 
ptylus duties doubt fully occupied securing election high priesthood plexo would probably go sometimes see mysa place imprisonment naturally anxious conciliate frighten giving consent marry soon possible 
therefore watch sufficiently closely sure lead us last 
certainly best way amuba 
think clearly plan promises best chance success 
might search country years without finding although wish keep hopes really despaired mind 
say follow plexo sooner later sure bring us 
shall want many disguises 
think matter walk day see chigron evening beg get disguises seem best us use 
jethro chebron said visit temple evening said 
long midnight quiet give plenty time sleep daytime work 
get garb peasant woman 
dress female head covering could surely get even know best would pass without suspicion 
many women taller 
disguise would question amuba well nigh tall besides wide strong looking would well 
yes think could pass woman jethro agreed certainly us watch rascal better 
think likely succeed night day 
plexo duties temple would likely pay visits dark 
would mere question speed foot amuba used trained running swift horse outpace us 
going city 
feel hopeful lads first time begin think chance discovering villains carried mysa 
day passed slowly chebron amuba 
would show outside tomb chigron earnestly begged besides frequently people hillside many came daily offer prayers tombs relatives 
still much talk chances finding mysa question placed recovered prospects long adventurous journey lay 
amuba encouraged talk points started conversation afresh whenever dropped saw excitement concerning mysa done great deal chebron 
weaned thoughts death father consequences arisen unfortunate shot given fresh subject thought revived spirits interest life 
lads glad late afternoon saw jethro ascending hill 
news said came 
day neighborhood house ptylus followed came two together 
overheard many scraps conversation one talked upon subject death ameres sacred cat want success search 
fact mysa carried spoken twice convinced manner slaves spoke subject slightest idea master concerned matter assuredly knowledge whatever house 
course possible might without generally known slaves 
still know things leak household everything done master mistress soon becomes public property one among heard something unusual going would time known servants 
hardly thought ptylus would ventured carried home might suppose mother suspicions might directed toward made complaint search house might ordered besides many servants secret kept 
clew obtained temple following plexo 
soon dark descended hill together 
chebron attired garments bearing distinguishing marks priesthood jethro brought obtained old lyptis 
near house embalmer lad stopped jethro went returned half hour various disguises asked chigron obtain 
exception scanty attire two peasants hid present bushes near path rubbed amuba skin fluid obtained chigron putting peasants clothes took way toward house ptylus 
chebron went toward temple short distance house jethro amuba sat wall close gate none could leave without knowledge 
beyond servants visitors one came 
ten clock heard bolts gates fastened remained near midnight chebron joined 
spent time wandering court court temple beyond solitary priest moving replenishing lamps altars seen one entirely unnoticed 
amuba chebron inclined dispirited want success watching jethro chid impatience 
suppose said going find secret well hidden hours watching 
may weeks succeed 
morrow begin watch two three hours sundown 
better known servants house ptylus often taken messages besides disguise could well loiter without attracting attention could 
therefore content watching northern road city upon chance taking way dress peasants watch house 
chebron might sit wall fifty yards house north side amuba best keep side road somewhat south gate 
way sight yet together solitary figures less likely attract attention two together two boys people looking 
scarcely know skins darkened trust small fear others detecting disguise 
accordingly next day three hours noon amuba chebron disguised peasants went house ptylus took posts arranged 
late afternoon amuba noticed one slaves house ptylus suddenly checked walk passed chebron gazed fixedly 
amuba left spot standing walked quickly direction 
slave spoke chebron rose feet 
moment later slave seized 
struggling amuba ran 
find slave exclaimed

springing back avoid grasp assailant amuba struck strength face reeled backward repeated blow man fell heavily ground

soon learned started along road would return hurried past people already gathered 
brought sword intention chariot returned would leap upon surprise slay officials drive knew would able take part making escape heard already insensible carried chariot 
groups people along road torches thought sudden surprise would probably successful 
last heard chariot approaching 
driven slowly expected 
came large group people distance ahead stopped moment official addressed people 
shout sound exultation felt convinced either upon arrival found already dead miraculous way escaped 
therefore hurried back next group 
chariot came shout news malefactor officials checked horses replied mistake made 
prince assures us lad poor slave wholly innocent affair 
satisfied jealousy honor gods peasants attacked lad committed grievous wrong fell upon wholly innocent person 
assuring wounds bound suffered depart 
prince intends lay complaint council persons cruelly maltreated nearly murdered innocent person stated interfered matter saw slave attacking young lad fled fearing trouble punishment inflicted upon aggressor 
announcement received silence chariot driven much murmuring 
account certainly appearance truth already known narrative slave recognized chebron person rescued youth stranger youth pursued chebron escaped 
still murmuring prince important matter suffered youth depart without searching examination 
said even boy story true deserved punishment attacking slave arrested chebron others said certainly beaten almost death punished sufficiently

hurried back news night watched morning came without arrival almost anxious fearing badly injured rejoin us day would almost certainly recaptured 
search chebron would assuredly actively carried insisted remaining quiet made frequent journeys city news beyond certainty recaptured although diligent search made well chebron learned nothing 
amuba relieved necessity much talk fill gaps story tell us persuaded egyptian prince innocence

first tell chebron took pursuers track idea sacrificing made sure able outrun done easily fresh people constantly taking pursuit last running 
amuba related whole story flight attack peasants rescue recited whole conversation rescuer proceedings leaving house 
see concluded strangely enough teaching father chebron tale ruth told us grandfather told god forefathers saved life 
prince israelitish birth also believed one god could hardly would saved vengeance people says disfavor king conduct allowing go free merely assertion innocence likely harm

strange story jethro said amuba brought narrative conclusion marvelous escape 
arrival prince upon spot moment must killed 
compassionate nature would never first place interfered behalf common faith would held officials arrived claim 
fortunate indeed kindness guide evidently long rest steps took reduce heat wounds must fallen hands searchers morning 
consider extraordinary critical moment rescued perhaps one man egypt would courage save 
upon following morning jethro amuba succeeded difficulty dissuading chebron determination give argument powerful effect would disobeying last orders father 
resolved future better disguise attired woman watch upon house ptylus recommenced station away 
thought indeed search neighborhood likely less rigorous elsewhere would thought probable fugitives would return spot recognized 
amuba disguise completely altered 
still dress peasant means pigments obtained chigron jethro transformed give casual observer appearance advanced years 
long discussion plan would adopt amuba jethro wishing chebron leave watching entirely 
would hear saying confident disguise woman one would know

doubtless day merely paid visit friends 
indeed fourth night waiting plexo came along 
time pass jethro therefore certain turned main road either right left point post jethro amuba

whole affection given father mother comparatively little 
child seldom allowed come room 
declared noise much talk made head ache fidgeting much borne 
since time much 
father seen welfare mysa would put aside grave studies walk talk always indulgent always anxious give pleasure 
therefore thoroughly entered mysa feelings saw possible alternative 
could go mysa jethro asked 
could placed wherever mother time would sure hear would reclaim 
shall go chebron amuba mysa said positively 
impossible jethro replied 
going upon tremendous journey full danger fatigue 
going among unknown savage peoples chances hundred one ever arriving end journey 
young men like chebron amuba past eighteen speedily men chance would success us walk well chebron mysa said 
know chebron 
suppose could suffer hardship well 
rate would rather suffer anything stop 
people murdered father 
mother would sell highest bidder 
chances great never get journey safety make much greater 
chebron world go goes die dies 
gods protect well journey

jethro silent 
addition charge would assuredly add immensely difficulties journey hand remembered anxiety ameres mysa asked late master would wished known matters stood 
glanced amuba chebron saw wishes agreed mysa 
turned away abruptly minutes paced garden 
returned group among word exchanged since left 
mysa said gravely great thing ask disguising presence add greatly difficulties add also perils may render impossible carry father wishes conduct chebron land beyond persecution egypt 
enterprise must undertaken light spirit 
go must prepared face death forms hunger thirst weapons wild natives

terrible journey men terrible still women still resolved resolved strength mind woman child turned back upon egypt never repent step taken wish return steadfast trials may befall us say shall share lot 
mysa uttered exclamation joy 
promise jethro whatever may happen hardship danger death shall never hear word complaint 
glad ruth think well ruth said gravely 
great undertaking think god hand 
would fain leave land idols except none world care 
jethro amuba said best already almost dark therefore could set 
could make use chariot jethro considered short time 
except carrying things may want first start see said leave chariot morrow morning would found known ptylus chariot missing would soon recognized thus clue afforded fact fled south 
traveling beyond night would question 
besides hold three 
use must drive north throw scent 
think worth 
undertake part business amuba said 
much morrow jethro arrange 
boat hired stores laid got readiness 
think best plan start girls thebes 
chebron occupy hiding place hill chigron glad take girls house 
danger immediate search made 
night priest son return servants suppose slept 
late morrow afternoon alarm likelihood messenger sent consternation confusion caused great probably one think carrying news officials next morning 
besides story mysa missing generally known reason taken place attributed us therefore next forty eight hours think would perfectly safe embalmer drive chariot thirty forty miles north turn horses loose sure noticed ere long return foot join hiding place morrow night 
think plan good one amuba 
start make search house 
nothing want take us would touch treasure villains house full toss things look robbery motive taken place 
men bonds know nothing real state things 
plexo rushed aid could time tell take arms follow indeed doubtful whether idea aught seemed 
therefore first impression assuredly malefactors worst kind escaped slaves men respect gods assuredly egyptians even worst criminals would cold blood laid hands high priest osiris 
laid hands father chebron said bitterly 
yes cold blood 
reports first spread among untrue gods maddened fanaticism horror death sacred cat 
cold blood said egyptian however vile criminal would lift hand priest 
may well come amuba would strange one us took part search 
ten minutes jethro amuba turned place confusion forcing open chests cabinets littering floor garments taking valuable vases jewels threw pond round fountain would concealed view water lilies floated surface 
examined afresh fastenings captives felt assured possibility could free 
sure freed morrow night amuba said otherwise like leave die hunger thirst 
glad jethro said thought chance forty hours instead twenty 
doubtless first evil business carried villain master may think lucky indeed take would every way safest best course namely run sword bodies silence forever 
thought could tell anything would really think anything tell add danger 
course priest wife knows mysa hidden proclaim fact missing would consider might afford clew apprehension attacked house slew husband son therefore see would much gained silencing people think differently finish 
amuba shook head although human life days thought little save egyptians shrank thought slaying captives cold blood 
tell nothing jethro 
best moving nothing talk 
think plans arranged long ago except course must get rather larger boat intended together garments girls 
think would best chebron still disguised woman settle morrow night 
good store dresses us choose chigron amuba led horses stone water trough allowed quench thirst 
mounted chariot drove rest party set foot thebes 
late reached chigron house thought better arouse inmates comment would excited arrival women late hour unexpected master girls therefore passed night rock chamber behind building jethro chebron lay outside 
soon dawn broke moved distance away 
jethro went house soon sign one astir told chigron discovered rescued mysa 
chigron much disturbed heard death high priest son 
say men villains jethro two high priests slaughtered course month enough bring anger gods upon egypt 
however poor girls responsible way willingly shelter especially one night shall vastly relieved know fairly journey 
well understand jethro said believe gratitude sheltered long live may well outweigh doubts may present whether acted wisely aiding victims superstitions countrymen 
chigron called servants told heard arrival country friends ordered room prepared 
went returned hour later two girls
