seeing keenly felt insult offered ladies asked table willingly prepared sudden departure 
mr germaine far away false friends experience tells recover tranquillity 
enough 
little daughter goes us course 
early morning drove school suburbs educated took away 
needless say delighted prospect traveling 
shocked schoolmistress waving hat head crying hooray like boy 
good lady careful inform daughter could possibly learned cry hooray house 
probably time read narrative committed care 
hardly dare ask stand estimation 
possible might seen good husband left london suddenly things must tell writing infinitely preferred saying friendly hand mine

poor little green flag revealed us lost control 
old time banks lake came back heart hungered darling happier days said yes may think ought still said 
take poor old dame dermody view believe kindred spirits reunited could parted take view simpler still love dearly fond meantime departure england seems wisest course adopt 
long woman lives say said already whenever find opportunity 
child might hear reports mother might injured gets older 
propose take abode time least neighborhood naples 
away yet may hope live without annoyance among people whose social law law mercy 
whatever may happen always one last consolation sustain us love 
talked traveling continent dined us 
wander way english consul naples friend husband address 
wonder whether shall ever meet seem hard charge misfortunes life faults 
speaking misfortunes may say close letter man owe never likely cross path 
van brandts amsterdam received certain information way new zealand 
determined prosecute returns 
little likely give opportunity 
traveling carriage door must say good 
husband sends kindest regards best wishes 
manuscript quite safe leave london send bankers address inclosed 
think sometimes think kindly 
appeal confidently kindness forget kissed parting
