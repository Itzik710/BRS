design present work sufficiently explained introduction 
reader must observe subjects planned treated two volumes 
subjects understanding passions make compleat chain reasoning willing take advantage natural division order try taste public 
good fortune meet success shall proceed examination morals politics criticism compleat treatise human nature 
approbation public consider greatest reward labors determined regard judgment whatever best instruction 
introduction 
nothing usual natural pretend discover anything new world philosophy sciences insinuate praises systems decrying advanced 
indeed content lamenting ignorance still lie important questions come tribunal human reason acquaintance sciences would readily agree 
easy one judgment learning perceive weak foundation even systems obtained greatest credit carried pretensions highest accurate profound reasoning 
principles taken upon trust consequences lamely deduced want coherence parts evidence whole every met systems eminent philosophers seem drawn disgrace upon philosophy 
required profound knowledge discover present imperfect condition sciences even rabble without doors may judge noise clamor hear goes well within 
nothing subject debate men learning contrary opinions 
trivial question escapes controversy momentous able give certain decision 
disputes multiplied every thing uncertain disputes managed greatest warmth every thing certain 
amidst bustle reason carries prize eloquence man needs ever despair gaining proselytes extravagant hypothesis art enough represent favourable colors 
victory gained men arms manage pike sword trumpeters drummers musicians army 
hence opinion arises common prejudice metaphysical reasonings kinds even amongst profess scholars value every part literature 
metaphysical reasonings understand particular branch science every kind argument way abstruse requires attention comprehended 
often lost labor researches commonly reject without hesitation resolve must ever prey errors delusions shall least natural entertaining 
indeed nothing determined scepticism along great degree indolence justify aversion metaphysics 
truth within reach human capacity certain must lie deep abstruse hope shall arrive without pains greatest geniuses failed utmost pains must certainly esteemed sufficiently vain presumptuous 
pretend advantage philosophy going unfold would esteem strong presumption easy obvious 
evident sciences relation greater less human nature however wide may seem run still return back one passage another 
even 
mathematics natural philosophy natural religion measure dependent science man since lie cognizance men judged powers faculties 
impossible tell changes improvements might make sciences thoroughly acquainted extent force human understanding could explain nature ideas employ operations perform reasonings 
improvements hoped natural religion content instructing us nature superior powers carries views farther disposition towards us duties towards consequently beings reason also one objects concerning reason 
therefore sciences mathematics natural philosophy natural religion dependence knowledge man may expected sciences whose connexion human nature close intimate sole end logic explain principles operations reasoning faculty nature ideas morals criticism regard tastes sentiments politics consider men united society dependent 
four sciences logic morals criticism politics comprehended almost everything way import us acquainted tend either improvement ornament human mind 
expedient hope success philosophical researches leave tedious lingering method hitherto followed instead taking castle village frontier march directly capital center sciences human nature masters may every else hope easy victory 
station may extend conquests sciences intimately concern human life may afterwards proceed leisure discover fully objects pore curiosity 
question importance whose decision comprised science man none decided certainty become acquainted science 
pretending therefore explain principles human nature effect propose compleat system sciences built foundation almost entirely new one upon stand security 
science man solid foundation sciences solid foundation give science must laid experience observation 
astonishing reflection consider application experimental philosophy moral subjects come natural distance whole century since find fact interval betwixt origins sciences reckoning thales socrates space time nearly equal betwixt lord bacon late philosophers mr locke lord shaftesbury dr mandeville mr hutchinson dr butler etc england begun put science man new footing engaged attention excited curiosity public 
true however nations may rival us poetry excel us agreeable arts improvements reason philosophy owing land toleration liberty 
ought think latter improvement science man less honor native country former natural philosophy ought rather esteem greater glory upon account greater importance science well necessity lay reformation 
seems evident essence mind equally unknown us external bodies must equally impossible form notion powers qualities otherwise careful exact experiments observation particular effects result different circumstances situations 
though must endeavor render principles universal possible tracing experiments utmost explaining effects simplest fewest causes still certain go beyond experience hypothesis pretends discover ultimate original qualities human nature ought first rejected presumptuous chimerical 
think philosopher would apply earnestly explaining ultimate principles soul would show great master science human nature pretends explain knowing naturally satisfactory mind man 
nothing certain despair almost effect upon us enjoyment sooner acquainted impossibility satisfying desire desire vanishes 
see arrived utmost extent human reason sit contented though perfectly satisfied main ignorance perceive give reason general refined principles beside experience reality reason mere vulgar required study first discovered particular extraordinary phaenomenon 
impossibility making farther progress enough satisfy reader writer may derive delicate satisfaction free confession ignorance prudence avoiding error many fallen imposing conjectures hypotheses world certain principles 
mutual contentment satisfaction obtained betwixt master scholar know require philosophy 
impossibility explaining ultimate principles esteemed defect science man venture affirm defect common sciences arts employ whether cultivated schools philosophers practiced shops meanest artizans 
none go beyond experience establish principles founded authority 
moral philosophy indeed peculiar disadvantage found natural collecting experiments make purposely premeditation manner satisfy concerning every particular difficulty may 
loss know effects one body upon another situation need put situation observe results 
endeavor clear manner doubt moral philosophy placing case consider evident reflection premeditation would disturb operation natural principles must render impossible form conclusion phenomenon 
must therefore glean experiments science cautious observation human life take appear common course world men behavior company affairs pleasures 
experiments kind judiciously collected compared may hope establish science inferior certainty much superior utility human comprehension

origin ideas 
perceptions human mind resolve two distinct kinds shall call impressions ideas 
difference betwixt consists degrees force liveliness strike upon mind make way thought consciousness 
perceptions enter force violence may name impressions name comprehend sensations passions emotions make first appearance soul 
ideas mean faint images thinking reasoning instance perceptions excited present discourse excepting arise sight touch excepting immediate pleasure uneasiness may occasion 
believe necessary employ many words explaining distinction 
every one readily perceive difference betwixt feeling thinking 
common degrees easily distinguished though impossible particular instances may nearly approach 
thus sleep fever madness violent emotions soul ideas may approach impressions hand sometimes happens impressions faint low distinguish ideas 
notwithstanding near resemblance instances general different one make scruple rank distinct heads assign peculiar name mark difference footnote 

footnote 
make use terms impression idea sense different usual hope liberty allowed 
perhaps rather restore word idea original sense mr locke perverted making stand perceptions 
terms impression would understood express manner lively perceptions produced soul merely perceptions particular name either english language know 
another division perceptions convenient observe extends impressions ideas 
division simple complex 
simple perceptions impressions ideas admit distinction separation 
complex contrary may distinguished parts 
though particular color taste smell qualities united together apple easy perceive least distinguishable 
divisions given order arrangement objects may apply consider accuracy qualities relations 
first circumstance strikes eye great resemblance betwixt impressions ideas every particular except degree force vivacity 
one seem manner reflexion perceptions mind double appear impressions ideas 
shut eyes think chamber ideas form exact representations impressions felt circumstance one found 
running perceptions find still resemblance representation 
ideas impressions appear always correspond 
circumstance seems remarkable engages attention moment 
upon accurate survey find carried away far first appearance must make use distinction perceptions simple complex limit general decision ideas impressions resembling 
observe many complex ideas never impressions corresponded many complex impressions never exactly copied ideas 
imagine city new jerusalem whose pavement gold walls rubies though never saw 
seen paris shall affirm form idea city perfectly represent streets houses real proportions perceive therefore though general great resemblance betwixt complex impressions ideas yet rule universally true exact copies 
may next consider case stands simple perceptions 
accurate examination capable venture affirm rule holds without exception every simple idea simple impression resembles every simple impression correspondent idea 
idea red form dark impression strikes eyes sun shine differ degree nature 
case simple impressions ideas impossible prove particular enumeration 
every one may satisfy point running many pleases 
one deny universal resemblance know way convincing desiring shew simple impression correspondent idea simple idea correspondent impression 
answer challenge certain may silence observation establish conclusion 
thus find simple ideas impressions resemble complex formed may affirm general two species perception exactly correspondent 
discovered relation requires farther examination curious find qualities 
let us consider 
stand regard existence impressions ideas causes effects 
full examination question subject present treatise therefore shall content establishing one general proposition simple ideas first appearance derived simple impressions correspondent exactly represent 
seeking phenomena prove proposition find two kinds kind phenomena obvious numerous conclusive 
first make certain new review already asserted every simple impression attended correspondent idea every simple idea correspondent impression 
constant conjunction resembling perceptions immediately conclude great connexion betwixt correspondent impressions ideas existence one considerable influence upon 
constant conjunction infinite number instances never arise chance clearly proves dependence impressions ideas ideas impressions 
may know side dependence lies consider order first appearance find constant experience simple impressions always take precedence correspondent ideas never appear contrary order 
give child idea scarlet orange sweet bitter present objects words convey impressions proceed absurdly endeavor produce impressions exciting ideas 
ideas upon appearance produce correspondent impressions perceive color feel sensation merely upon thinking 
hand find impression either mind body constantly followed idea resembles different degrees force liveliness constant conjunction resembling perceptions convincing proof one causes priority impressions equal proof impressions causes ideas ideas impressions 
confirm consider another plain convincing phaenomenon ever accident faculties give rise impressions obstructed operations one born blind deaf impressions lost also correspondent ideas never appear mind least traces either 
true organs sensation entirely destroyed likewise never put action produce particular impression 
form idea taste pine apple without actually tasted 
however one contradictory phaenomenon may prove absolutely impossible ideas go correspondent impressions 
believe readily allowed several distinct ideas colors enter eyes sounds conveyed hearing really different though time resembling 
true different colors must less different shades color produces distinct idea independent rest 
denied possible continual gradation shades run color insensibly remote allow means different without absurdity deny extremes 
suppose therefore person enjoyed sight thirty years become perfectly well acquainted colors kinds excepting one particular shade blue instance never fortune meet 
let different shades color except single one placed descending gradually deepest lightest plain perceive blank shade wanting said sensible greater distance place betwixt contiguous colors 
ask whether possible imagination supply deficiency raise idea particular shade though never conveyed senses believe opinion may serve proof simple ideas always derived correspondent impressions though instance particular singular scarce worth observing merit alone alter general maxim 
besides exception may amiss remark head principle priority impressions ideas must understood another limitation viz ideas images impressions form secondary ideas images primary appears reasoning concerning 
properly speaking exception rule much explanation 
ideas produce images 
selves new ideas first ideas supposed derived impressions still remains true simple ideas proceed either mediately immediately correspondent impressions 
first principle establish science human nature ought despise simplicity appearance 
remarkable present question concerning precedency impressions ideas made much noise terms disputed whether innate ideas whether ideas derived sensation reflexion 
may observe order prove ideas extension color innate philosophers nothing shew conveyed senses 
prove ideas passion desire innate observe preceding experience emotions 
carefully examine arguments shall find prove nothing ideas preceded lively perceptions derived represent 
hope clear stating question remove disputes concerning win render principle use reasonings seems hitherto

division subject 
since appears simple impressions prior correspondent ideas exceptions rare method seems require examine impressions consider ideas 
impressions way divided two kinds sensation reflexion 
first kind arises soul originally unknown causes 
second derived great measure ideas following order 
impression first strikes upon senses makes us perceive heat cold thirst hunger pleasure pain kind 
impression copy taken mind remains impression ceases call idea 
idea pleasure pain returns upon soul produces new impressions desire aversion hope fear may properly called impressions reflexion derived 
copied memory imagination become ideas perhaps turn give rise impressions ideas 
impressions reflexion antecedent correspondent ideas posterior sensation derived 
examination sensations belongs anatomists natural philosophers moral therefore shall present entered upon 
impressions reflexion viz 
passions desires emotions principally deserve attention arise mostly ideas necessary reverse method first sight seems natural order explain nature principles human mind give particular account ideas proceed impressions 
reason chosen begin ideas 
sect 
iii 
ideas memory imagination 
find experience impression present mind makes appearance idea may two different ways either new appearance retains considerable degree first vivacity somewhat intermediate betwixt impression idea entirely loses vivacity perfect idea 
faculty repeat impressions first manner called memory imagination 
evident first sight ideas memory much lively strong imagination former faculty paints objects distinct colors employed latter 
remember past event idea flows upon mind forcible manner whereas imagination perception faint languid without difficulty preserved mind steddy uniform considerable time 
sensible difference betwixt one species ideas another 
fully hereafter 
part ii sect 

another difference betwixt two kinds ideas less evident namely though neither ideas memory imagination neither lively faint ideas make appearance mind unless correspondent impressions gone prepare way yet imagination restrained order form original impressions memory manner tied respect without power variation 
evident memory preserves original form objects presented ever depart recollecting thing proceeds defect imperfection faculty 
historian may perhaps convenient carrying narration relate event another fact posterior takes notice disorder exact means replaces idea due position 
case recollection places persons formerly acquainted 
chief exercise memory preserve simple ideas order position 
short principle supported number common vulgar phaenomena may spare trouble insisting farther 
evidence follows us second principle liberty imagination transpose change ideas 
fables meet poems romances put entirely question 
nature totally confounded nothing mentioned winged horses fiery dragons monstrous giants 
liberty fancy appear strange consider ideas copyed impressions two impressions perfectly inseparable 
mention evident consequence division ideas simple complex 
ever imagination perceives difference among ideas easily produce separation 
sect 
iv 
connexion association ideas 
simple ideas may separated imagination may united form pleases nothing would unaccountable operations faculty guided universal principles render measure uniform times places 
ideas entirely loose unconnected chance alone would join impossible simple ideas fall regularly complex ones commonly without bond union among associating quality one idea naturally introduces another 
uniting principle among ideas considered inseparable connexion already excluded imagination yet conclude without mind join two ideas nothing free faculty regard gentle force commonly prevails cause among things languages nearly correspond nature manner pointing every one simple ideas proper united complex one 
qualities association arises mind manner conveyed one idea another three viz 
resemblance contiguity time place cause effect 
believe necessary prove qualities produce association among ideas upon appearance one idea naturally introduce another 
plain course thinking constant revolution ideas imagination runs easily one idea resembles quality alone fancy sufficient bond association 
likewise evident senses changing objects necessitated change regularly take lie contiguous imagination must long custom acquire method thinking run along parts space time conceiving objects 
connexion made relation cause effect shall occasion afterwards examine bottom therefore shall present insist upon 
sufficient observe relation produces stronger connexion fancy makes one idea readily recall another relation cause effect betwixt objects 
may understand full extent relations must consider two objects connected together imagination one immediately resembling contiguous cause also interposed betwixt third object bears relations 
may carried great length though time may observe remove considerably weakens relation 
cousins fourth degree connected causation may allowed use term closely brothers much less child parent 
general may observe relations blood depend upon cause effect esteemed near remote according number connecting causes interposed betwixt persons 
three relations mentioned causation extensive 
two objects may considered placed relation well one cause actions motions former cause existence latter 
action motion nothing object considered certain light object continues different situations easy imagine influence objects upon one another may connect imagination 
may carry farther remark two objects connected relation cause effect one produces motion action also power producing 
may observe source relation interest duty men influence society placed ties government subordination 
master one situation arising either force agreement power directing certain particulars actions another call servant 
judge one disputed cases fix opinion possession property thing betwixt members society 
person possessed power required convert action exertion every case considered possible many probable especially case authority obedience subject pleasure advantage superior 
therefore principles union cohesion among simple ideas imagination supply place inseparable connexion united memory 
kind attraction mental world found extraordinary effects natural shew many various forms 
effects every conspicuous causes mostly unknown must resolved original qualities human nature pretend explain 
nothing requisite true philosopher restrain intemperate desire searching causes established doctrine upon sufficient number experiments rest contented sees farther examination would lead obscure uncertain speculations 
case enquiry would much better employed examining effects causes principle 
amongst effects union association ideas none remarkable complex ideas common subjects thoughts reasoning generally arise principle union among simple ideas 
complex ideas may divided relations modes substances 
shall briefly examine order shall subjoin considerations concerning general particular ideas leave present subject may considered elements philosophy 
sect 
v relations 
word relation commonly used two senses considerably different 
either quality two ideas connected together imagination one naturally introduces manner explained particular circumstance even upon arbitrary union two ideas fancy may think proper compare 
common language former always sense use word relation philosophy extend mean particular subject comparison without connecting principle 
thus distance allowed philosophers true relation acquire idea comparing objects common way say nothing distant things nothing less relation distance relation incompatible 
may perhaps esteemed endless task enumerate qualities make objects admit comparison ideas philosophical relation produced 
diligently consider shall find without difficulty may comprised seven general heads may considered sources philosophical relation 
first resemblance relation without philosophical relation exist since objects admit comparison degree resemblance 
though resemblance necessary philosophical relation follow always produces connexion association ideas 
quality becomes general common great many individuals leads mind directly one presenting great choice thereby prevent imagination fixing single object 
identity may esteemed second species relation 
relation consider applied strictest sense constant unchangeable objects without examining nature foundation personal identity shall find place afterwards 
relations universal identity common every whose existence duration 
identity universal comprehensive relations space time sources infinite number comparisons distant contiguous etc 
objects admit quantity number may compared particular another fertile source relation 
two objects possess quality common degrees possess form fifth species relation 
thus two objects heavy one may either greater less weight 
two colors kind may yet different shades respect admit comparison 
relation contrariety may first sight regarded exception rule relation kind subsist without degree resemblance 
let us consider two ideas contrary except existence non existence plainly resembling implying idea object though latter excludes object times places supposed exist 
objects fire water heat cold found contrary experience contrariety causes effects relation cause effect seventh philosophical relation well natural one 
resemblance implied relation shall explained afterwards 
might naturally expected join difference relations 
consider rather negation relation anything real positive 
difference two kinds opposed either identity resemblance 
first called difference number kind

modes substances would fain ask philosophers found much reasonings distinction substance accident imagine clear ideas whether idea substance derived impressions sensation reflection conveyed us senses ask manner perceived eyes must color ears sound palate taste senses 
believe none assert substance either color sound taste 
idea substance must therefore derived impression reflection really exist 
impressions reflection resolve passions emotions none possibly represent substance 
therefore idea substance distinct collection particular qualities meaning either talk reason concerning 
idea substance well mode nothing collection simple ideas united imagination particular name assigned able recall either others collection 
difference betwixt ideas consists particular qualities form substance commonly referred unknown something supposed inhere granting fiction take place least supposed closely inseparably connected relations contiguity causation 
effect whatever new simple quality discover connexion rest immediately comprehend among even though enter first conception substance 
thus idea gold may first yellow color weight malleableness fusibility upon discovery dissolubility aqua regia join qualities suppose belong substance much idea beginning made part compound one 
principal union regarded chief part complex idea gives entrance whatever quality afterwards occurs equally comprehended others first presented 

take place modes evident considering mature 

simple ideas modes formed either represent qualities united contiguity causation dispersed different subjects united together uniting principle regarded foundation complex idea 
idea dance instance first kind modes beauty second 
reason obvious complex ideas receive new idea without changing name distinguishes mode 
sect

abstract ideas 
material question started concerning abstract general ideas whether general particular mind conception 
great philosopher dr berkeley 
disputed received opinion particular asserted general ideas nothing particular ones annexed certain term gives extensive signification makes recall upon occasion individuals similar 
look upon one greatest valuable discoveries made late years republic letters shag endeavor confirm arguments hope put beyond doubt controversy 
evident forming general ideas abstract every particular degree quantity quality object ceases particular species account every small alteration extension duration properties 
may therefore thought plain dilemma decides concerning nature abstract ideas afforded much speculation philosophers 
abstract idea man represents men sizes qualities concluded either representing possible sizes possible qualities representing particular one 
esteemed absurd defend former proposition implying infinite capacity mind commonly inferred favor letter abstract ideas supposed represent particular degree either quantity quality 
inference erroneous shall endeavor make appear first proving utterly impossible conceive quantity quality without forming precise notion degrees secondly showing though capacity mind infinite yet form notion possible degrees quantity quality manner least however imperfect may serve purposes reflection conversation 
begin first proposition mind form notion quantity quality without forming precise notion degrees may prove three following arguments 
first observed whatever objects different distinguishable whatever objects distinguishable separable thought imagination 
may add propositions equally true inverse whatever objects separable also distinguishable whatever objects distinguishable also different 
possible separate distinguishable distinguish different order therefore know whether abstraction implies separation need consider view examine whether circumstances abstract general ideas distinguishable different retain essential parts 
evident first sight precise length line different distinguishable line 
precise degree quality quality 
ideas therefore admit separation distinction difference 
consequently conjoined conception general idea line notwithstanding abstractions refinements appearance mind precise degree quantity quality however may made represent others different degrees 
secondly contest object appear senses words impression become present mind without determined degrees quantity quality 
confusion impressions sometimes involved proceeds faintness unsteadiness capacity mind receive impression real existence particular degree proportion 
contradiction terms even implies flattest contradictions viz 
possible thing 
since ideas derived impressions nothing copies representations whatever true one must acknowledged concerning 
impressions ideas differ strength vivacity 
foregoing conclusion founded particular degree vivacity 
therefore affected variation particular 
idea weaker impression strong impression must necessarily determinate quantity quality case must copy representative 
thirdly principle generally received philosophy everything nature individual utterly absurd suppose triangle really existent precise proportion sides angles 
therefore absurd fact reality must also absurd idea since nothing form clear distinct idea absurd impossible 
form idea object form idea simply thing reference idea object extraneous denomination bears mark character 
impossible form idea object possest quantity quality yet possest precise degree either follows equal impossibility forming idea limited confined particulars 
abstract ideas therefore individual however may become general representation 
image mind particular object though application reasoning universal 
application ideas beyond nature proceeds collecting possible degrees quantity quality imperfect manner may serve purposes life second proposition proposed explain 
found resemblance footnote 
among several objects often occur us apply name whatever differences may observe degrees quantity quality whatever differences may appear among 
acquired custom kind hearing name revives idea one objects makes imagination conceive particular circumstances proportions 
word supposed frequently applied individuals different many respects idea immediately present mind word able revive idea individuals touches soul may allowed speak revives custom acquired surveying 
really fact present mind power draw distinctly imagination keep readiness survey may prompted present design necessity 
word raises individual idea along certain custom custom produces individual one may occasion 
production ideas name may applied eases impossible abridge work partial consideration find inconveniences arise reasoning abridgment 
footnote 
evident even different simple ideas may similarity resemblance necessary point circumstance resemblance shoud distinct separable differ 
blue green different simple ideas resembling blue scarlet tho perfect simplicity excludes possibility separation distinction 
case particular sounds tastes smells 
admit infinite resemblances upon general appearance comparison without common circumstance 
may certain even abstract terms simple idea 
comprehend simple ideas 
resemble simplicity 
yet nature excludes composition circumstance resemble distinguishable separable rest 
case degrees quality 
resembling yet quality individual distinct degree 
one extraordinary circumstances present affair mind produced individual idea upon reason attendant custom revived general abstract term readily suggests individual chance form reasoning agrees 
thus mention word triangle form idea particular equilateral one correspond afterwards assert three angles triangle equal individuals scalenum isosceles overlooked first immediately crowd upon us make us perceive falshood proposition though true relation idea formed 
mind suggests always ideas upon occasion proceeds imperfection faculties one often source false reasoning sophistry 
principally case ideas abstruse compounded 
occasions custom entire seldom run errors 
nay entire custom idea may annext several different words may employed different reasonings without danger mistake 
thus idea equilateral triangle inch perpendicular may serve us talking figure rectilinear figure regular figure triangle equilateral triangle 
ar terms therefore case attended idea wont applied greater lesser compass excite particular habits thereby keep mind readiness observe conclusion formed contrary ideas usually comprized 
habits become entirely perfect perhaps mind may content forming idea one individual may run several order make comprehend meaning compass collection intends express general term 
may fix meaning word figure may revolve mind ideas circles squares parallelograms triangles different sizes proportions may rest one image idea 
however may certain form idea individuals whenever use general term seldom never exhaust individuals remain represented means habit recall whenever present occasion requires 
nature abstract ideas general terms manner account foregoing paradox ideas particular nature general representation 
particular idea becomes general annexed general term term customary conjunction relation many particular ideas readily recalls imagination 
difficulty remain subject must regard custom readily recalls every particular idea may occasion excited word sound commonly annex 
proper method opinion giving satisfactory explication act mind producing instances analogous principles facilitate operation 
explain ultimate causes mental actions impossible 
sufficient give satisfactory account experience analogy 
first observe mention great number thousand mind generally adequate idea power producing idea adequate idea decimals number comprehended 
imperfection however ideas never felt reasonings seems instance parallel present one universal ideas 
secondly several instances habits may revived one single word person rote periods discourse number verses put remembrance whole loss recollect single word expression begin 
thirdly believe every one examines situation mind reasoning agree annex distinct compleat ideas every term make use talking government church negotiation conquest seldom spread minds simple ideas complex ones composed 
however observable notwithstanding imperfection may avoid talking nonsense subjects may perceive repugnance among ideas well fall comprehension 
thus instead saying war weaker always recourse negotiation say always recourse conquest custom acquired attributing certain relations ideas still follows words makes us immediately perceive absurdity proposition manner one particular idea may serve us reasoning concerning ideas however different several circumstances 
fourthly individuals collected together said placed general term view resemblance bear relation must facilitate entrance imagination make suggested readily upon occasion 
indeed consider common progress thought either reflection conversation shall find great reason satisfyed particular 
nothing admirable readiness imagination suggests ideas presents instant become necessary useful 
fancy runs one end universe collecting ideas belong subject 
one would think whole intellectual world ideas subjected view nothing pick proper purpose 
may however present beside ideas thus collected kind magical faculty soul though always perfect greatest geniuses properly call genius however inexplicable utmost efforts human understanding 
perhaps four reflections may help remove difficulties hypothesis proposed concerning abstract ideas contrary hitherto prevailed philosophy tell truth place chief confidence already proved concerning impossibility general ideas according common method explaining 
must certainly seek new system head plainly none beside proposed 
ideas particular nature time finite number custom become general representation contain infinite number ideas 
leave subject shall employ principles explain distinction reason much talked little understood schools 
kind distinction betwixt figure body figured motion body moved 
difficulty explaining distinction arises principle explained ideas different separable 
follows thence figure different body ideas must separable well distinguishable different ideas neither separable distinguishable 
meant distinction reason since implies neither difference separation 
remove difficulty must recourse foregoing explication abstract ideas 
certain mind would never dreamed distinguishing figure body figured reality neither distinguishable different separable observe even simplicity might contained many different resemblances relations 
thus globe white marble presented receive impression white color disposed certain form able separate distinguish color form 
observing afterwards globe black marble cube white comparing former object find two separate resemblances formerly seemed really perfectly inseparable 
little practice kind begin distinguish figure color distinction reason consider figure color together since effect undistinguishable still view different aspects according resemblances susceptible 
would consider figure globe white marble form reality idea figure color tacitly carry eye resemblance globe black marble manner would consider color turn view resemblance cube white marble 
means accompany ideas kind reflection custom renders us great measure insensible 
person desires us consider figure globe white marble without thinking color desires impossibility meaning consider figure color together still keep eye resemblance globe black marble globe whatever color substance

infinite divisibility ideas space time 
whatever air paradox contrary first unprejudiced notions mankind often greedily embraced philosophers shewing superiority science coued discover opinions remote vulgar conception 
hand anything proposed us causes surprize admiration gives satisfaction mind indulges agreeable emotions never persuaded pleasure entirely without foundation 
dispositions philosophers disciples arises mutual complaisance betwixt former furnish plenty strange unaccountable opinions latter readily believe 
mutual complaisance give evident instance doctrine infinite divisibility examination shall begin subject ideas space time 
universally allowed capacity mind limited never attain full adequate conception infinity though allowed would sufficiently evident plainest observation experience 
also obvious whatever capable divided infinitum must consist infinite number parts impossible set bounds number parts without setting bounds time division 
requires scarce induction conclude hence idea form finite quality infinitely divisible proper distinctions separations may run idea inferior ones perfectly simple indivisible 
rejecting infinite capacity mind suppose may arrive end division ideas possible means evading evidence conclusion 
therefore certain imagination reaches minimum may raise idea conceive sub division diminished without total annihilation 
tell thousandth ten thousandth part grain sand distinct idea numbers different proportions images form mind represent things nothing different inferior image represent grain sand supposed vastly exceed 
consists parts distinguishable distinguishable separable 
whatever may imagine thing idea grain sand distinguishable separable twenty much less thousand ten thousand infinite number different ideas 
case impressions senses ideas imagination 
put spot ink upon paper fix eye upon spot retire distance last lose sight plain moment vanished image impression perfectly indivisible 
want rays light striking eyes minute parts distant bodies convey sensible impression removed beyond distance impressions reduced minimum incapable farther diminution 
microscope telescope renders visible produces new rays light spreads always flowed means gives parts impressions naked eye appear simple uncompounded advances minimum formerly imperceptible 
may hence discover error common opinion capacity mind limited sides impossible imagination form adequate idea goes beyond certain degree minuteness well greatness 
nothing minute ideas form fancy images appear senses since ideas images perfectly simple indivisible 
defect senses give us disproportioned images things represent minute uncompounded really great composed vast number parts 
mistake sensible taking impressions minute objects appear senses equal nearly equal objects finding reason objects vastly minute hastily conclude inferior idea imagination impression senses 
however certain form ideas shall greater smallest atom animal spirits insect thousand times less mite ought rather conclude difficulty lies enlarging conceptions much form notion mite even insect thousand times less mite 
order form notion animals must distinct idea representing every part according system infinite divisibility utterly impossible recording indivisible parts atoms extremely difficult reason vast number multiplicity parts

infinite divisibility space time 
wherever ideas adequate representations objects relations contradictions agreements ideas applicable objects may general observe foundation human knowledge 
ideas adequate representations minute parts extension whatever divisions subdivisions may suppose parts arrived never become inferior ideas form 
plain consequence whatever appears impossible contradictory upon comparison ideas must really impossible contradictory without farther excuse evasion 
every thing capable infinitely divided contains infinite number parts otherwise division would stopt short indivisible parts immediately arrive 
therefore finite extension infinitely divisible contradiction suppose finite extension contains infinite number parts vice versa contradiction suppose finite extension contains infinite number parts finite extension infinitely divisible 
latter supposition absurd easily convince consideration clear ideas 
first take least idea form part extension certain nothing minute idea conclude whatever discover means must real quality extension 
repeat idea twice thrice c find compound idea extension arising repetition always augment become double triple quadruple c till last swells considerable bulk greater smaller proportion repeat less idea 
stop addition parts idea extension ceases augment carry addition infinitum clearly perceive idea extension must also become infinite 
upon whole conclude idea infinite number parts individually idea infinite extension finite extension capable containing infinite number parts consequently finite extension infinitely divisible footnote 

footnote 
objected infinite divisibility supposes infinite number proportional aliqiot parts infinite number proportional parts form infinite extension 
distinction entirely frivolous 
whether parts calld aliquot proportional inferior minute parts conceive therefore form less extension conjunction 
may subjoin another argument proposed noted author mons 
malezieu seems strong beautiful 
evident existence belongs unity never applicable number account unites number composed 
twenty men may said exist one two three four c existent deny existence latter former falls course 
therefore utterly absurd suppose number exist yet deny existence unites extension always number according common sentiment metaphysicians never resolves unite indivisible quantity follows extension never exist 
vain reply determinate quantity extension unite one admits infinite number fractions inexhaustible sub divisions 
rule twenty men may considered unit 
whole globe earth nay whole universe may considered unit 
term unity merely fictitious denomination mind may apply quantity objects collects together unity exist alone number reality true number 
unity exist alone whose existence necessary number another kind must perfectly indivisible incapable resolved lesser unity 
reasoning takes place regard time along additional argument may proper take notice 
property inseparable time manner constitutes essence parts succeeds another none however contiguous ever co existent 
reason year concur present year every moment must distinct posterior antecedent another 
certain time exists must composed indivisible moments 
time could never arrive end division moment succeeds another perfectly single indivisible would infinite number co existent moments parts time believe allowed arrant contradiction 
infinite divisibility space implies time evident nature motion 
latter therefore impossible former must equally 
doubt readily allowed obstinate defender doctrine infinite divisibility arguments difficulties impossible give answer perfectly clear satisfactory 
may observe nothing absurd custom calling difficulty pretends demonstration endeavoring means elude force evidence 
demonstrations probabilities difficulties take place one argument counter ballance another diminish authority 
demonstration admits opposite difficulty mere sophism consequently never difficulty

qualities idea space time 
discovery coued made happily deciding controversies concerning ideas abovementioned impressions always take precedency every idea imagination furnished first makes appearance correspondent impression 
latter perceptions clear evident admit controversy though many ideas obscure almost impossible even mind forms tell exactly nature composition 
let us apply principle order discover farther nature ideas space time 
upon opening eyes turning surrounding objects perceive many visible bodies upon shutting considering distance betwixt bodies acquire idea extension 
every idea derived impression exactly similar impressions similar idea extension must either sensations derived sight internal impressions arising sensations 
internal impressions passions emotions desires aversions none believe ever asserted model idea space derived 
remains therefore nothing senses convey us original impression 
impression oar senses convey us principal question decides without appeal concerning nature idea 
table alone sufficient view give idea extension 
idea borrowed represents impression moment appears senses 
senses convey impressions colored points disposed certain manner 
eye sensible thing farther desire may pointed 
impossible shew thing farther may conclude certainty idea extension nothing copy colored points manner appearance 
suppose extended object composition colored points first received idea extension points purple color follows every repetition idea would place points order respect also bestow precise color alone acquainted 
afterwards experience colors violet green red white black different compositions finding resemblance disposition colored points composed omit peculiarities color far possible found abstract idea merely disposition points manner appearance agree 
nay even resemblance carryed beyond objects one sense impressions touch found similar sight disposition parts hinder abstract idea representing upon account resemblance 
abstract ideas really nothing particular ones considered certain light annexed general terms able represent vast variety comprehend objects alike particulars others vastly wide 
idea time derived succession perceptions every kind ideas well impressions impressions reflection well sensations afford us instance abstract idea comprehends still greater variety space yet represented fancy particular individual idea determinate quantity quality 
disposition visible tangible objects receive idea space succession ideas impressions form idea time possible time alone ever make appearance taken notice mind 
man sound sleep strongly occupyed one thought insensible time according perceptions succeed greater less rapidity duration appears longer shorter imagination 
remarked great philosopher perceptions certain bounds particular fixed original nature constitution mind beyond influence external objects senses ever able hasten retard thought 
wheel burning coal rapidity present senses image circle fire seem interval time betwixt revolutions meerly impossible perceptions succeed rapidity motion may communicated external objects 
wherever successive perceptions notion time even though real succession objects 
phenomena well many others may conclude time make appearance mind either alone attended steady unchangeable object always discovered perceivable succession changeable objects 
confirm may add following argument seems perfectly decisive convincing 
evident time duration consists different parts otherwise coued conceive longer shorter duration 
also evident parts co existent quality co existence parts belongs extension distinguishes duration 
time composed parts coexistent unchangeable object since produces none coexistent impressions produces none give us idea time consequently idea must derived succession changeable objects time first appearance never severed succession 
therefore found time first appearance mind always conjoined succession changeable objects otherwise never fall notice must examine whether conceived without conceiving succession objects whether alone form distinct idea imagination 
order know whether objects joined impression inseparable idea need consider different case plain may conceived apart 
every thing different distinguishable everything distinguishable may separated according maxims explained 
contrary different distinguishable distinguishable separated 
precisely case respect time compared successive perceptions 
idea time derived particular impression mixed others plainly distinguishable arises altogether manner impressions appear mind without making one number 
five notes played flute give us impression idea time though time sixth impression presents hearing senses 
sixth impression mind reflection finds 
five sounds making appearance particular manner excite emotion mind produce affection kind observed give rise new idea 
necessary produce new idea reflection mind revolving thousand times ideas sensation ever extract new original idea unless nature framed faculties feels new original impression arise contemplation 
takes notice manner different sounds make appearance may afterwards consider without considering particular sounds may conjoin objects 
ideas objects certainly must possible without ideas ever arrive conception time since appears primary distinct impression plainly nothing different ideas impressions objects disposed certain manner succeeding 
know pretend idea duration applicable proper sense objects perfectly unchangeable take common opinion philosophers well vulgar 
convinced falsehood need reflect foregoing conclusion idea duration always derived succession changeable objects never conveyed mind thing stedfast unchangeable 
inevitably follows thence since idea duration derived object never propriety exactness applied thing unchangeable ever said duration 
ideas always represent objects impressions derived never without fiction represent applied 
fiction apply idea time even unchangeable suppose common duration measure rest well motion shall consider sect 
afterwards 
another decisive argument establishes present doctrine concerning ideas space time founded simple principle ideas compounded parts indivisible 
argument may worth examining 
every idea distinguishable also separable let us take one simple indivisible ideas compound one extension formed separating others considering apart let us form judgment nature qualities 
plain idea extension 
idea extension consists parts idea according supposition perfectly simple indivisible 
therefore nothing absolutely impossible 
compound idea extension real composed ideas many non entities would real existence composed non entities absurd 
therefore must ask idea simple indivisible point wonder answer appear somewhat new since question scarce ever yet thought 
wont dispute concerning nature mathematical points seldom concerning nature ideas 
idea space conveyed 
mind two senses sight touch anything ever appear extended either visible tangible 
compound impression represents extension consists several lesser impressions indivisible eye feeling may called impressions atoms corpuscles endowed color solidity 

requisite atoms colored tangible order discover senses also necessary preserve idea color tangibility order comprehend imagination 
nothing idea color tangibility render conceivable mind 
upon removal ideas sensible qualities utterly annihilated thought imagination 
parts whole 
point considered colored tangible convey us idea consequently idea extension composed ideas points never possibly exist 
idea extension really exist conscious parts must also exist order must considered colored tangible 
therefore idea space extension regard object either sight feeling 
reasoning prove indivisible moments time must filled real object existence whose succession forms duration makes conceivable mind

objections answered 
system concerning space time consists two parts intimately connected together

second objection derived necessity would penetration extension consisted mathematical points 
simple indivisible atom touches another must necessarily penetrate impossible touch external parts supposition perfect simplicity excludes parts

taking penetration sense annihilation one body upon approach another ask one sees necessity colored tangible point annihilated upon approach another colored tangible point contrary evidently perceive union points results object compounded divisible may distinguished two parts preserves existence distinct separate notwithstanding contiguity let aid fancy conceiving points different colors better prevent coalition confusion 
blue red point may surely lie contiguous without penetration annihilation

many objections drawn mathematics indivisibility parts extension though first sight science seems rather favourable present doctrine contrary demonstrations perfectly conformable definitions 
present business must defend definitions refute demonstrations 
surface defined length breadth without depth line length without breadth depth point neither length breadth depth

else coued thing exist without length without breadth without depth two different answers find made argument neither opinion satisfactory 
first objects geometry surfaces lines points whose proportions positions examines mere ideas mind never never exist nature 
never exist one pretend draw line make surface entirely conformable definition never exist may produce demonstrations ideas prove impossible

vain search contradiction thing distinctly conceived mind 
imply contradiction impossible coued ever conceived 
therefore medium betwixt allowing least possibility indivisible points denying idea latter principle second answer foregoing argument founded 
pretended l art de penser 
though impossible conceive length without breadth yet abstraction without separation consider one without regarding manner may think length way betwixt two towns overlook breadth 
length inseparable breadth nature minds excludes partial consideration distinction reason manner explained 
refuting answer shall insist argument already sufficiently explained impossible mind arrive minimum ideas capacity must infinite order comprehend infinite number parts idea extension would composed 
shall endeavor find new absurdities reasoning 
surface terminates solid line terminates surface point terminates line assert ideas point line surface indivisible impossible ever conceive terminations let ideas supposed infinitely divisible let fancy endeavor fix idea last surface line point immediately finds idea break parts upon seizing last parts loses hold new division infinitum without possibility arriving concluding idea 
number fractions bring nearer last division first idea formed

school sensible force argument maintained nature mixed among particles matter divisible infinitum number mathematical points order give termination bodies others eluded force reasoning heap unintelligible cavils distinctions 
adversaries equally yield victory 
man hides confesses evidently superiority enemy another fairly delivers arms 
thus appears definitions mathematics destroy pretended demonstrations idea indivisible points lines surfaces conformable definition existence certainly possible idea impossible ever conceive termination figure without conception geometrical demonstration 
go farther maintain none demonstrations sufficient weight establish principle infinite divisibility regard minute objects properly demonstrations built ideas exact maxims precisely true 
geometry decides anything concerning proportions quantity ought look utmost precision exactness 
none proofs extend far 
takes dimensions proportions figures justly roughly liberty 
errors never considerable would err aspire absolute perfection 
first ask mathematicians mean say one line surface equal greater less another let give answer whatever sect belongs whether maintains composition extension indivisible points quantities divisible infinitum 
question embarrass 
mathematicians defend hypothesis indivisible points yet readiest justest answer present question 
need reply lines surfaces equal numbers points equal proportion numbers varies proportion lines surfaces also varyed 
though answer well obvious yet may affirm standard equality entirely useless never comparison determine objects equal unequal respect 
points enter composition line surface whether perceived sight touch minute confounded utterly impossible mind compute number computation never afford us standard may judge proportions 
one ever able determine exact numeration inch fewer points foot foot fewer ell greater measure reason seldom never consider standard equality inequality 
imagine extension divisible infinitum impossible make use answer fix equality line surface numeration component parts 
since according hypothesis least well greatest figures contain infinite number parts since infinite numbers properly speaking neither equal unequal respect equality inequality portions space never depend proportion number parts 
true may said inequality ell yard consists different numbers feet composed foot yard number inches 
bat quantity call inch one supposed equal call inch impossible mind find equality proceeding infinitum references inferior quantities evident last must fix standard equality different enumeration parts 
see dr barrow mathematical lectures 
pretend equality best defined congruity two figures equal upon placing one upon parts correspond touch 
order judge definition let us consider since equality relation strictly speaking property figures arises merely comparison mind makes betwixt 
consists therefore imaginary application mutual contact parts must least distinct notion parts must conceive contact 
plain conception would run parts greatest minuteness possibly conceived since contact large parts would never render figures equal 
minutest parts conceive mathematical points consequently standard equality derived equality number points already determined useless standard 
must therefore look quarter solution present difficulty 
many philosophers refuse assign standard equality assert sufficient present two objects equal order give us notion proportion 
definitions say fruitless without perception objects perceive objects longer stand need definition 
reasoning entirely agree assert useful notion equality inequality derived whole united appearance comparison particular objects 
evident eye rather mind often able one view determine proportions bodies pronounce equal greater less without examining comparing number minute parts 
judgments common many cases certain infallible 
measure yard foot presented mind question first longer second doubt principles clear self evident 
therefore three proportions mind distinguishes general appearance objects calls names greater less equal 
though decisions concerning proportions sometimes infallible always judgments kind exempt doubt error subject 
frequently correct first opinion review reflection pronounce objects equal first esteemed unequal regard object less though appeared greater another 
correction judgments senses undergo often discover error juxtaposition objects impracticable use common invariable measure successively applied informs us different proportions 
even correction susceptible new correction different degrees exactness according nature instrument measure bodies care employ comparison 
therefore mind accustomed judgments corrections finds proportion makes two figures eye appearance call equality makes also correspond common measure compared form mixed notion equality derived looser stricter methods comparison 
content 
sound reason convinces us bodies vastly minute appear senses false reason would perswade us bodies infinitely minute clearly perceive possessed instrument art measuring secure us ill error uncertainty 
sensible addition removal one minute parts discernible either appearance measuring imagine two figures equal equal removal addition therefore suppose imaginary standard equality appearances measuring exactly corrected figures reduced entirely proportion 
standard plainly imaginary 
idea equality particular appearance corrected juxtaposition common measure 
notion correction beyond instruments art make mere fiction mind useless well incomprehensible 
though standard imaginary fiction however natural anything usual mind proceed manner action even reason ceased first determined begin 
appears conspicuously regard time though evident exact method determining proportions parts even exact extension yet various corrections measures different degrees exactness given obscure implicit notion perfect entire equality 
case many subjects 
musician finding ear becoming every day delicate correcting reflection attention proceeds act mind even subject fails entertains notion compleat tierce octave without able tell whence derives standard 
painter forms fiction regard colors 
mechanic regard motion 
one light shade swift slow imagined capable exact comparison equality beyond judgments senses 
may apply reasoning curve right lines 
nothing apparent senses distinction betwixt curve right line ideas easily form ideas objects 
however easily may form ideas impossible produce definition fix precise boundaries betwixt 
draw lines upon paper continued surface certain order lines run along one point another may produce entire impression curve right line order perfectly unknown nothing observed united appearance 
thus even upon system indivisible points form distant notion unknown standard objects 
upon infinite divisibility go even length reduced meerly general appearance rule determine lines either curve right ones 
though give perfect definition lines produce exact method distinguishing one yet hinders us correcting first appearance accurate consideration comparison rule whose rectitude repeated trials greater assurance 
corrections carrying action mind even reason fails us form loose idea perfect standard figures without able explain comprehend 
true mathematicians pretend give exact definition right line say shortest way betwixt two points 
first place observe properly discovery one properties right line deflation 
ask one upon mention right line thinks immediately particular appearance accident considers property right line comprehended alone definition unintelligible without comparison lines conceive extended 
common life established maxim straightest way always shortest would absurd say shortest way always shortest idea right line different shortest way betwixt two points 
secondly repeat already established precise idea equality inequality shorter longer right line curve consequently one never afford us perfect standard 
exact idea never built loose undetermined 
idea plain surface little susceptible precise standard right line means distinguishing surface general appearance 
vain mathematicians represent plain surface produced flowing right line 
immediately objected idea surface independent method forming surface idea ellipse cone idea right line precise plain surface right line may flow irregularly means form figure quite different plane therefore must suppose flow along two right lines parallel plane description explains thing returns circle 
appears ideas essential geometry viz 
equality inequality right line plain surface far exact determinate according common method conceiving 
incapable telling case degree doubtful particular figures equal line right one surface plain one form idea proportion figures firm invariable 
appeal still weak fallible judgment make appearance objects correct compass common measure join supposition farther correction one either useless imaginary 
vain recourse common topic employ supposition deity whose omnipotence may enable form perfect geometrical figure describe right line without curve inflexion 
ultimate standard figures derived nothing senses imagination absurd talk perfection beyond faculties judge since true perfection thing consists conformity standard 
since ideas loose uncertain would fain ask mathematician infallible assurance intricate obscure propositions science vulgar obvious principles prove instance two right lines one common segment impossible draw one right line betwixt two points tell opinions obviously absurd repugnant clear ideas would answer deny two right lines incline upon sensible angle absurd imagine common segment 
supposing two lines approach rate inch twenty leagues perceive absurdity asserting upon contact become one 
beseech rule standard judge assert line supposed concur make right line two form small angle betwixt must surely idea right line line agree 
therefore mean takes points order rule peculiar essential right line must inform besides judging manner allow extension composed indivisible points perhaps intend besides say must inform neither standard form idea right line firmness senses imagination determine order violated preserved 
original standard right line reality nothing certain general appearance evident right lines may made concur yet correspond standard though corrected means either practicable imaginable 
whatever side mathematicians turn dilemma still meets 
judge equality proportion accurate exact standard viz 
enumeration minute indivisible parts employ standard useless practice actually establish indivisibility extension endeavor explode 
employ usual inaccurate standard derived comparison objects upon general appearance corrected measuring juxtaposition first principles though certain infallible coarse afford subtile inferences commonly draw 
first principles founded imagination senses conclusion therefore never go beyond much less contradict faculties 
may open eyes little let us see geometrical demonstration infinite divisibility extension much force naturally attribute every argument supported magnificent pretensions 
time may learn reason geometry falls evidence single point reasonings command fullest assent approbation 
indeed seems requisite give reason exception shew really must make exception regard mathematical arguments infinite divisibility utterly sophistical 
evident idea quantity infinitely divisible imagined glaring absurdity endeavor prove quantity admits division prove means ideas directly opposite particular 
absurdity glaring argument founded 
attended new absurdity involves evident contradiction 
might give instances arguments infinite divisibility derived point contact 
know mathematician refuse judged diagrams describes upon paper loose draughts tell us serving convey greater facility certain ideas true foundation reasoning

whichever side chuses runs equal difficulties

third objection carries matter still farther asserts idea vacuum real possible also necessary unavoidable 
assertion founded motion observe bodies maintained would impossible inconceivable without vacuum one body must move order make way another 

shall enlarge upon objection principally belongs natural philosophy lies without present sphere 
order answer objections must take matter pretty deep consider nature origin several ideas lest dispute without understanding perfectly subject controversy 
evident idea darkness positive idea merely negation 
light properly speaking colored visible objects 
man enjoys sight receives perception turning eyes every side entirely deprived light common one born blind certain one idea either light darkness

question whether intervals afford us idea extension without body begin first case evident two luminous bodies appear eye perceive whether conjoined separate whether separated great small distance distance varies perceive increase diminution motion bodies 
distance case thing colored visible may thought vacuum pure extension intelligible mind obvious senses 
natural familiar way thinking shall learn correct little reflection 
may observe two bodies present formerly entire darkness change discoverable appearance two objects rest continues perfect negation light every colored visible object 
true may said remote bodies also distance interposed betwixt nothing darkness negation light without parts without composition invariable indivisible 
since distance causes perception different blind man receives eyes conveyed us darkest night must partake properties blindness darkness afford us ideas extension impossible dark undistinguishable distance betwixt two bodies ever produce idea 
sole difference betwixt absolute darkness appearance two visible luminous objects consists said objects manner affect senses 
angles rays light flowing form motion required eye passage one different parts organs affected produce perceptions judge distance 
perceptions simple indivisible never give us idea extension 
may illustrate considering sense feeling imaginary distance interval interposed betwixt tangible solid objects 
suppose two cases viz 
man supported air moving limbs fro without meeting thing tangible man feeling something tangible leaves motion sensible perceives another tangible object ask wherein consists difference betwixt two cases one make scruple affirm consists meerly perceiving objects sensation arises motion cases sensation capable conveying us idea extension unaccompanyed perception give us idea mixed impressions tangible objects since mixture produces alteration upon 
though motion darkness either alone attended tangible visible objects convey idea vacuum extension without matter yet causes falsly imagine form idea 
close relation betwixt motion darkness real extension composition visible tangible objects 
first may observe two visible objects appearing midst utter darkness affect senses manner form angle rays flow meet eye distance betwixt find visible objects give us true idea extension 
sensation motion likewise nothing tangible interposed betwixt two bodies feel compounded body whose different parts placed beyond 
secondly find experience two bodies placed affect senses manner two others certain extent visible objects interposed betwixt capable receiving extent without sensible impulse penetration without change angle appear senses 
like manner one object feel another without interval perceiving sensation call motion hand organ sensation experience shews us possible object may felt sensation motion along interposed impression solid tangible objects attending sensation 
words invisible intangible distance may converted visible tangible one without change distant objects 
thirdly may observe another relation betwixt two kinds distance nearly effects every natural phaenomenon 
qualities heat cold light attraction c diminish proportion distance little difference observed whether distance marled compounded sensible objects known manner distant objects affect senses 
three relations betwixt distance conveys idea extension filled colored solid object 
distant objects affect senses manner whether separated one distance second species distance found capable receiving first equally diminish force every quality 
relations betwixt two kinds distance afford us easy reason one often taken imagine idea extension without idea object either sight feeling 
may establish general maxim science human nature wherever close relation betwixt two ideas mind apt mistake discourses reasonings use one 
phaenomenon occurs many occasions consequence forbear stopping moment examine causes

three relations mentioned resemblance fertile source error indeed mistakes reasoning borrow largely origin

last circumstance great consequence may general observe wherever actions mind forming two ideas resembling apt confound ideas take one 
shall see many instances progress treatise 
though resemblance relation readily produces mistake ideas yet others causation contiguity may also concur influence 
might produce figures poets orators sufficient proofs usual reasonable metaphysical subjects draw arguments quarter 
lest metaphysicians esteem dignity shall borrow proof observation may made discourses viz 
usual men use words ideas talk instead thinking reasonings 
use words ideas commonly closely connected mind easily mistakes 
likewise reason substitute idea distance considered either visible tangible room extension nothing composition visible tangible points disposed certain order 
causing mistake concur relations causation resemblance 
first species distance found convertible second respect kind cause similarity manner affecting senses diminishing every quality forms relation resemblance 
chain reasoning explication principles prepared answer objections offered whether derived metaphysics mechanics 
frequent disputes concerning vacuum extension without matter prove reality idea upon dispute turns nothing common see men deceive particular especially means close relation another idea presented may occasion mistake 
may make almost answer second objection derived conjunction ideas rest annihilation 
every thing annihilated chamber walls continue immoveable chamber must conceived much manner present air fills object senses 
annihilation leaves eye fictitious distance discovered different parts organ affected degrees light shade feeling consists sensation motion hand member body

afterwards experience comes play persuade us two bodies situated manner described really capacity receiving body betwixt obstacle conversion invisible intangible distance one visible tangible

certainty arises comparison ideas discovery relations unalterable long ideas continue 
relations resemblance proportions quantity number degrees quality contrariety none implyed proposition whatever beginning also cause existence 
proposition therefore intuitively certain 
least one would assert intuitively certain must deny infallible relations must find relation kind implyed time enough examine 
argument proves foregoing proposition neither intuitively demonstrably certain 
never demonstrate necessity cause every new existence new modification existence without shewing time impossibility thing ever begin exist without productive principle latter proposition proved must despair ever able prove former 
latter proposition utterly incapable demonstrative proof may satisfy considering distinct ideas separable ideas cause effect evidently distinct easy us conceive object non existent moment existent next without conjoining distinct idea cause productive principle 
separation therefore idea cause beginning existence plainly possible imagination consequently actual separation objects far possible implies contradiction absurdity therefore incapable refuted reasoning mere ideas without impossible demonstrate necessity cause 
accordingly shall find upon examination every demonstration produced necessity cause fallacious sophistical 
points time place say philosophers mr hobbes 
suppose object exist equal unless cause peculiar one time one place means determines fixes existence must remain eternal suspence object never begin want something fix beginning

object exists absolutely without cause certainly cause assert one follows suppose point questions take granted utterly impossible thing ever begin exist without cause upon exclusion one productive principle must still recourse another

employed demonstrate necessity cause 
whatever produced without cause produced nothing words nothing cause 
nothing never cause something equal two right angles 
intuition perceive nothing equal two right angles something perceive never cause consequently must perceive every object real cause existence 
believe necessary employ many words shewing weakness argument said foregoing 
founded fallacy derived turn thought 
sufficient observe exclude causes really exclude neither suppose nothing object causes existence consequently draw argument absurdity suppositions prove absurdity exclusion 
every thing must cause follows upon exclusion causes must accept object nothing causes 
point question whether every thing must cause therefore according reasoning ought never taken granted 
still frivolous say every effect must cause implyed idea effect 
every effect necessarily pre supposes cause effect relative term cause correlative

thus advancing insensibly discovered new relation betwixt cause effect least expected entirely employed upon another subject

though reasoning seems obvious yet would folly despair soon shall continue thread discourse found discovery constant conjunction objects always draw inference one object another shall examine nature inference transition impression idea

reason determined us would proceed upon principle instances experience must resemble experience course nature continues always uniformly

thus reason fails us discovery ultimate connexion causes effects even experience informed us constant conjunction impossible us satisfy reason extend experience beyond particular instances fallen observation 
suppose never able prove must resemblance betwixt objects experience lie beyond reach discovery 
already taken notice certain relations make us pass one object another even though reason determine us transition may establish general rule wherever mind constantly uniformly makes transition without reason influenced relations 
exactly present case 
reason never shew us connexion one object another though aided experience observation constant conjunction past instances 
mind therefore passes idea impression one object idea belief another determined reason certain principles associate together ideas objects unite imagination 
ideas union fancy objects seem understanding coued never draw inference causes effects repose belief matter fact 
inference therefore depends solely union ideas 
principles union among ideas reduced three general ones asserted idea impression object naturally introduces idea object resembling contiguous connected 
principles allow neither infallible sole causes union among ideas 
infallible causes 
one may fix attention sometime one object without looking farther 
sole causes

though allow weakness three relations irregularity imagination yet assert general principles associate ideas resemblance contiguity causation 
indeed principle union among ideas first sight may esteemed different found bottom depend origin 
every individual species objects found experience constantly united individual another species appearance new individual either species naturally conveys thought usual attendant 
thus particular idea commonly annexed particular word nothing required hearing word produce correspondent idea scarce possible mind utmost efforts prevent transition 
case absolutely necessary upon hearing particular sound reflect past experience consider idea usually connected sound 
imagination supplies place reflection accustomed pass word idea interposes moment delay betwixt hearing one conception 
though acknowledge true principle association among ideas assert betwixt ideas cause effects essential part reasonings relation

probability chances 
order bestow system full force evidence must carry eye moment consider consequences explain principles species reasoning derived origin 
philosophers divided human reason knowledge probability defined first evidence arises comparison ideas obliged comprehend arguments causes effects general term probability 
though every one free use terms sense pleases accordingly precedent part discourse followed method expression however certain common discourse readily affirm many arguments causation exceed probability may received superior kind evidence 
one would appear ridiculous would say probable sun rise morrow men must dye though plain assurance facts experience affords us 
reason would perhaps convenient order preserve common signification words mark several degrees evidence distinguish human reason three kinds viz 
knowledge proofs probabilities 
knowledge mean assurance arising comparison ideas 
proofs arguments derived relation cause effect entirely free doubt uncertainty 
probability evidence still attended uncertainty 
last species reasoning proceed examine 
probability reasoning conjecture may divided two kinds viz 
founded chance arises causes 
shall consider order 
idea cause effect derived experience presenting us certain objects constantly conjoined produces habit surveying relation without sensible violence survey iii 
hand chance nothing real properly speaking merely negation cause influence mind contrary causation essential leave imagination perfectly indifferent either consider existence non existence object regarded contingent 
cause traces way thought manner forces us survey certain objects certain relations 
chance destroy determination thought leave mind native situation indifference upon absence cause instantly instated 
since therefore entire indifference essential chance one chance possibly superior another otherwise composed superior number equal chances 
affirm one chance manner superior another must time affirm something gives superiority determines event rather side words must allow cause destroy supposition chance established 
perfect total indifference essential chance one total indifference never either superior inferior another 
truth peculiar system acknowledged every one forms calculations concerning chances 
remarkable though chance causation directly contrary yet impossible us conceive combination chances requisite render one hazard superior another without supposing mixture causes among chances conjunction necessity particulars total indifference others 
nothing limits chances every notion extravagant fancy form upon footing equality circumstance give one advantage another 
thus unless allow causes make dice fall preserve form fall lie upon one sides form calculation concerning laws hazard 
supposing causes operate supposing likewise rest indifferent determined chance easy arrive notion superior combination chances 
dye four sides marked certain number spots two another affords us obvious easy instance superiority 
mind limited causes precise number quality events time undetermined choice particular event 
proceeding reasoning wherein advanced three steps chance merely negation cause produces total indifference mind one negation cause one total indifference never superior inferior another must always mixture causes among chances order foundation reasoning next consider effect superior combination chances upon mind manner influences judgment opinion 
may repeat arguments employed examining belief arises causes may prove manner superior number chances produces assent neither demonstration probability 
indeed evident never comparison mere ideas make discovery consequence affairs impossible prove certainty event must fall side superior number chances 
suppose case certainty overthrow established concerning opposition chances perfect equality indifference 
said though opposition chances impossible determine certainty side event fall yet pronounce certainty likely probable side superior number chances inferior said would ask meant likelihood probability likelihood probability chances superior number equal chances consequently say likely event win fall side superior rather inferior affirm superior number chances actually superior inferior inferior identical propositions consequence 
question means superior number equal chances operates upon mind produces belief assent since appears neither arguments derived demonstration probability 
order clear difficulty shall suppose person take dye formed manner four sides marked one figure one number spots two another put dye box intention throwing plain must conclude one figure probable give preference inscribed greatest number sides 
manner believes lie uppermost though still hesitation doubt proportion number chances contrary according contrary chances diminish superiority encreases side belief acquires new degrees stability assurance 
belief arises operation mind upon simple limited object us therefore nature easily discovered explained 
nothing one single dye contemplate order comprehend one curious operations understanding 
dye formed contains three circumstances worthy attention 
first certain causes gravity solidity cubical figure c determine fall preserve form fall turn one sides 
secondly certain number sides supposed indifferent 
thirdly certain figure inscribed side 
three particulars form whole nature dye far relates present purpose consequently circumstances regarded mind forming judgment concerning result throw 
let us therefore consider gradually carefully must influence circumstances thought imagination 
first already observed mind determined custom pass cause effect upon appearance one almost impossible form idea 
constant conjunction past instances produced habit mind always conjoins thought infers existence one usual attendant 
considers dye longer supported box without violence regard suspended air naturally places table views turning one sides 
effect intermingled causes requisite forming calculation concerning chances 
secondly supposed though dye necessarily determined fall turn one sides yet nothing fix particular side determined entirely chance 
nature essence chance negation causes leaving mind perfect indifference among events supposed contingent 
therefore thought determined causes consider dye falling turning one sides chances present sides equal make us consider every one one another alike probable possible 
imagination passes cause viz 
throwing dye effect viz 
turning one six sides feels kind impossibility stopping short way forming idea 
six sides incompatible dye turn one principle directs us consider lying uppermost look upon impossible neither direct us entire force particular side case side would considered certain inevitable directs us whole six sides manner divide force equally among 
conclude general one must result throw run minds determination thought common force falls share one suitable proportion rest 
manner original impulse consequently vivacity thought arising causes divided split pieces intermingled chances 
already seen influence two first qualities dye viz 
causes number indifference sides learned give impulse thought divide impulse many parts unites number sides 
must consider effects third particular viz 
figures inscribed side 
evident several sides figure inscribe must concur influence mind must unite upon one image idea figure divided impulses dispersed several sides upon figure inscribed 
question side turned perfectly equal one coued ever advantage another 
question concerning figure figure presented one side evident impulses belonging sides must unite one figure become stronger forcible union 
four sides supposed present case figure inscribed two another figure

probability causes 
said concerning probability chances serve purpose assist us explaining probability causes since commonly allowed philosophers vulgar call chance nothing secret concealed cause 
species probability therefore must chiefly examine 
probabilities causes several kinds derived origin viz 
association ideas present impression 
habit produces association arises frequent conjunction objects must arrive perfection degrees must acquire new force instance falls observation 
first instance little force second makes addition third becomes still sensible slow steps judgment arrives full assurance 
attains pitch perfection passes several inferior degrees esteemed presumption probability 
gradation therefore probabilities proofs many cases insensible difference betwixt kinds evidence easily perceived remote degrees near contiguous 
worthy remark occasion though species probability explained first order naturally takes place entire proof exist yet one arrived age maturity longer acquainted 
true nothing common people advanced knowledge attained imperfect experience many particular events naturally produces imperfect habit transition must consider mind formed another observation concerning connexion causes effects gives new force reasoning observation means build argument one single experiment duly prepared examined 
found follow object conclude ever follow maxim always built upon certain want sufficient number experiments frequently meet instances contrary leads us second species probability contrariety experience observation 
would happy men conduct lives actions objects always conjoined together nothing fear mistakes judgment without reason apprehend uncertainty nature 
frequently found one observation contrary another causes effects follow order experience obliged vary reasoning account uncertainty take consideration contrariety events 
first question occurs head concerning nature causes contrariety 
vulgar take things according first appearance attribute uncertainty events uncertainty causes makes often fail usual influence though meet obstacle impediment operation 
philosophers observing almost every part nature contained vast variety springs principles hid reason minuteness remoteness find least possible contrariety events may proceed contingency cause secret operation contrary causes 
possibility converted certainty farther observation remark upon exact scrutiny contrariety effects always betrays contrariety causes proceeds mutual hindrance opposition 
peasant give better reason stopping clock watch say commonly go right artizan easily perceives force spring pendulum always influence wheels fails usual effect perhaps reason grain dust puts stop whole movement 
observation several parallel instances philosophers form maxim connexion betwixt causes effects equally necessary seeming uncertainty instances proceeds secret opposition contrary causes 
however philosophers vulgar may differ explication contrariety events inferences always kind founded principles 
contrariety events past may give us kind hesitating belief future two several ways 
first producing imperfect habit transition present impression related idea 
conjunction two objects frequent without entirely constant mind determined pass one object entire habit union uninterrupted instances ever met uniform piece 

find common experience actions well reasonings constant perseverance course life produces strong inclination tendency continue future though habits inferior degrees force proportioned inferior degrees steadiness uniformity conduct 
doubt principle sometimes takes place produces inferences draw contrary phaenomena though perswaded upon examination shall find principle commonly influences mind species reasoning 
follow habitual determination mind make transition without reflection interpose moment delay betwixt view one object belief often found attend 
custom depends upon deliberation operates immediately without allowing time reflection 
method proceeding instances probable reasonings even fewer derived uninterrupted conjunction objects 
former species reasoning commonly take knowingly consideration contrariety past events compare different sides contrariety carefully weigh experiments side whence may conclude reasonings kind arise directly habit oblique manner must endeavor explain 
evident object attended contrary effects judge past experience always consider possible observed follow 
past experience regulates judgment concerning possibility effects concerning probability effect common always esteem likely 
two things considered viz 
reasons determine us make past standard future manner extract single judgment contrariety past events 
first may observe supposition future resembles past founded arguments kind derived entirely habit determined expect future train objects accustomed 
habit determination transfer past future full perfect consequently first impulse imagination species reasoning endowed qualities 
secondly considering past experiments find contrary nature determination though full perfect presents us steady object offers us number disagreeing images certain order proportion 
first impulse therefore broke pieces diffuses images partakes equal share force vivacity derived impulse 
past events may happen judge happen mixed proportion past 
intention therefore consider proportions contrary events great number instances images presented past experience must remain first form preserve first proportions 
suppose instance found long observation twenty ships go sea nineteen return 
suppose see present twenty ships leave port transfer past experience future represent nineteen ships returning safety one perishing 
concerning difficulty 
frequently run several ideas past events order form judgment concerning one single event appears uncertain consideration must change first form ideas draw together divided images presented experience since refer determination particular event upon reason 
many images supposed concur superior number concur one side 
agreeing images unite together render idea strong lively mere fiction imagination also idea supported lesser number experiments 
new experiment new stroke pencil bestows additional vivacity colors without either multiplying enlarging figure 
operation mind fully explained treating probability chance need endeavor render intelligible 
every past experiment may considered kind chance uncertain us whether object exist conformable one experiment another 
reason every thing said one subject applicable 
thus upon whole contrary experiments produce imperfect belief either weakening habit dividing afterwards joining different parts perfect habit makes us conclude general instances experience must necessarily resemble 
justify still farther account second species probability reason knowledge reflection contrariety past experiments shall propose following considerations without fearing give offence air subtilty attends 
reasoning ought still perhaps retain force however subtile manner matter preserves solidity air fire animal spirits well grosser sensible forms 
first may observe probability great allow contrary possibility otherwise would cease probability would become certainty 
probability causes extensive present examine depends contrariety experiments evident experiment past proves least possibility future 
secondly component parts possibility probability nature differ number kind 
observed single chances entirely equal circumstance give event contingent superiority another superior number chances 
like manner uncertainty causes discovery experience presents us view contrary events plain transfer past future known unknown every past experiment weight superior number throw ballance side 
possibility therefore enters every reasoning kind composed parts nature among compose opposite probability 
thirdly may establish certain maxim moral well natural phaenomena wherever cause consists number parts effect encreases diminishes according variation number effects properly speaking compounded one arises union several effects proceed part cause 
thus gravity body encreases diminishes encrease diminution parts conclude part contains quality contributes gravity whole 
absence presence part cause attended proportionable part effect 
connexion constant conjunction sufficiently proves one part cause 
belief event encreases diminishes according number chances past experiments considered compounded effect part arises proportionable number chances experiments 
let us join three observations see conclusion draw 
every probability opposite possibility 
possibility composed parts entirely nature probability consequently influence mind understanding 
belief attends probability compounded effect formed concurrence several effects proceed part probability 
since therefore part probability contributes production belief part possibility must influence opposite side nature parts entirely 
contrary belief attending possibility implies view certain object well probability opposite view 
particular degrees belief alike 
manner superior number similar component parts one exert influence prevail inferior producing stronger lively view object 
part presents particular view views uniting together produce one general view fuller distinct greater number causes principles derived 
component parts probability possibility alike nature must produce like effects likeness effects consists presents view particular object 
though parts alike nature different quantity number difference must appear effect well similarity 
view present cases full entire comprehends object parts impossible particular difference thing superior vivacity probability arising concurrence superior number views distinguish effects 
almost argument different light 
reasonings concerning probability causes founded transferring past future 
transferring past experiment future sufficient give us view object whether experiment single combined others kind whether entire opposed others contrary kind 
suppose acquires qualities combination opposition loses upon account former power presenting view object concurs opposes experiments like influence 
question therefore may arise concerning manner concurrence opposition 
concurrence choice left betwixt two hypotheses 
first view object occasioned transference past experiment preserves entire multiplies number views 
secondly runs similar correspondent views gives superior degree force vivacity 
first hypothesis erroneous evident experience informs us belief attending reasoning consists one conclusion multitude similar ones would distract mind many cases would numerous comprehended distinctly finite capacity 
remains therefore reasonable opinion similar views run unite forces produce stronger clearer view arises one alone 
manner past experiments concur transfered future event 
manner opposition evident contrary views incompatible impossible object exist conformable influence becomes mutually destructive mind determined superior force remains subtracting inferior 
sensible abstruse reasoning must appear generality readers accustomed profound reflections intellectual faculties mind apt reject chimerical whatever strikes common received notions easiest obvious principles philosophy 
doubt pains required enter arguments though perhaps little necessary perceive imperfection every vulgar hypothesis subject little light philosophy yet afford us sublime curious speculations 
let men fully perswaded two principles nothing object considered afford us reason drawing conclusion beyond even observation frequent constant conjunction objects reason draw inference concerning object beyond experience say let men fully convinced two principles throw loose common systems make difficulty receiving may appear extraordinary 
principles found sufficiently convincing even regard certain reasonings causation shall venture affirm regard conjectural probable reasonings still acquire new degree evidence 
first obvious reasonings kind object presented us considered affords us reason draw conclusion concerning object event 
latter object supposed uncertain uncertainty derived concealed contrariety causes former causes placed known qualities object would longer concealed would conclusion uncertain 
secondly equally obvious species reasoning transference past future founded merely conclusion understanding coued never occasion belief assurance 
transfer contrary experiments future repeat contrary experiments particular proportions coued produce assurance single event upon reason unless fancy melted together images concur extracted one single idea image intense lively proportion number experiments derived superiority antagonists 
past experience presents determinate object belief however faint fixes determinate object evident belief arises merely transference past future operation fancy conjoined 
may lead us conceive manner faculty enters reasonings 
shall conclude subject two reflections may deserve attention 
first may explained manner 
mind forms reasoning concerning matter fact probable casts eye backward upon past experience transferring future presented many contrary views object kind uniting together running one act mind serve fortify inliven 
suppose multitude views glimpses object proceeds experience 
voluntary act imagination effect follow least follows degree 
though custom education produce belief repetition derived experience yet requires long tract time along frequent undesigned repetition 
general may pronounce person would voluntarily repeat idea mind though supported one past experience would inclined believe existence object contented one survey 
beside effect design act mind separate independent separate influence joins force fellows 
united common object producing relation consequently make transition union forces 
phaenomenon shall understand better afterwards 
second reflection founded large probabilities mind judge minute differences observe betwixt 
chances experiments one side amount ten thousand ten thousand one judgment gives preference latter upon account superiority though plainly impossible mind run every particular view distinguish superior vivacity image arising superior number difference inconsiderable 
parallel instance affections 
evident according principles mentioned object produces passion us varies according different quantity object say evident passion properly speaking simple emotion compounded one great number weaker passions derived view part object 
otherwise impossible passion encrease encrease parts 
thus man desires thousand pound reality thousand desires uniting together seem make one passion though composition evidently betrays upon every alteration object preference gives larger number superior unite 
yet nothing certain small difference would discernible passions coued render distinguishable 
difference therefore conduct preferring greater number depends upon passions upon custom general rules 
found multitude instances augmenting numbers sum augments passion numbers precise difference sensible 
mind perceive immediate feeling three guineas produce greater passion two transfers larger numbers resemblance general rule assigns thousand guineas stronger passion nine hundred ninety nine 
general rules shall explain presently 
beside two species probability derived imperfect experience contrary causes third arising analogy differs material circumstances 
according hypothesis explained kinds reasoning causes effects founded two particulars viz constant conjunction two objects past experience resemblance present object one 
effect two particulars present object invigorates inlivens imagination resemblance along constant union conveys force vivacity related idea therefore said believe assent

vivacity first impression fully conveyed related idea either conjunction objects constant present impression perfectly resemble whose union accustomed observe

without degree resemblance well union impossible reasoning resemblance admits many different degrees reasoning becomes proportionably less firm certain

may begin observing difficulty present case concerning matter fact whether mind forms conclusion concerning continued existence perceptions concerning manner conclusion formed principles derived 
certain almost mankind even philosophers greatest part lives take perceptions objects suppose intimately present mind real body material existence 
also certain perception object supposed continued uninterrupted neither annihilated absence brought existence presence 
absent say still exists feel see 
present say feel see 
may arise two questions first satisfy supposing perception absent mind without annihilated 
secondly manner conceive object become present mind without new creation perception image mean seeing feeling perceiving 
first question may observe 
call mind nothing heap collection different perceptions united together certain relations supposed though falsely endowed perfect simplicity identity 
every perception distinguishable another may considered separately existent evidently follows absurdity separating particular perception mind breaking relations connected mass perceptions constitute thinking 
reasoning affords us answer second question 
name perception renders separation mind absurd contradictory name object standing thing never render conjunction impossible 
external objects seen felt become present mind acquire relation connected heap perceptions influence considerably augmenting number present reflections passions storing memory ideas 
continued uninterrupted may therefore sometimes present mind sometimes absent without real essential change 
interrupted appearance senses implies necessarily interruption existence 
supposition continued existence sensible objects perceptions involves contradiction 
may easily indulge inclination supposition 
exact resemblance perceptions makes us ascribe identity may remove seeming interruption feigning continued may fill intervals preserve perfect entire identity perceptions 
feign believe continued existence question whence arises belief question leads us fourth member system

relation causes smooth passage impression idea even gives propensity passage 
mind falls easily one perception scarce perceives change retains second considerable share vivacity first 
excited lively impression vivacity conveyed related idea without great diminution passage reason smooth transition propensity imagination 
suppose propensity arises principle besides relation evident must still effect convey vivacity impression idea 
exactly present case 
memory presents us vast number instances perceptions perfectly resembling return different distances time considerable interruptions 
resemblance gives us propension consider interrupted perceptions also propension connect continued existence order justify identity avoid contradiction interrupted appearance perceptions seems necessarily involve us 
propensity feign continued existence sensible objects propensity arises lively impressions memory bestows vivacity fiction words makes us believe continued existence body 
sometimes ascribe continued existence objects perfectly new us whose constancy coherence experience manner present senses resembles constant coherent objects resemblance source reasoning analogy leads us attribute qualities similar objects 
believe intelligent reader find less difficulty assent system comprehend fully distinctly allow little reflection every part carries proof along 
indeed evident vulgar suppose perceptions objects time believe continued existence matter must account origin belief upon supposition 
upon supposition false opinion objects perceptions identically interruption consequently opinion identity never arise reason must arise imagination 
imagination seduced opinion means resemblance certain perceptions since find resembling perceptions propension suppose 
propension bestow identity resembling perceptions produces fiction continued existence since fiction well identity really false acknowledged philosophers effect remedy interruption perceptions circumstance contrary identity

thus examining parts find supported strongest proofs together form consistent system perfectly convincing 
strong propensity inclination alone without present impression sometimes cause belief opinion 
much aided circumstance though led manner natural propensity imagination ascribe continued existence sensible objects perceptions find resemble interrupted appearance yet little reflection philosophy sufficient make us perceive fallacy opinion 
already observed intimate connexion betwixt two principles continued distinct independent existence sooner establish one follows necessary consequence 
opinion continued existence first takes place without much study reflection draws along wherever mind follows first natural tendency

though opinion false natural alone primary recommendation fancy 
second part proposition philosophical system acquires influence imagination vulgar one may observe natural unavoidable consequence foregoing conclusion primary recommendation reason imagination 
philosophical system found experience take hold many minds particular reflect ever little subject must derive authority vulgar system since original authority 
manner two systems though directly contrary connected together may explains follows 
imagination naturally runs train thinking 
perceptions objects resembling perceptions however broken uninterrupted appearance appealing interruption contrary identity interruption consequently extends beyond appearance perception object really continues exist even absent us sensible perception therefore continued uninterrupted existence 
little reflection destroys conclusion perceptions continued existence shewing dependent one would naturally expected must altogether reject opinion thing nature continued existence preserved even longer appears senses

long attention bent upon subject philosophical studyed principle may prevail moment relax thoughts nature display draw us back former opinion 
nay sometimes influence stop progress even midst profound reflections keep us running consequences philosophical opinion 
thus though clearly perceive dependence interruption perceptions stop short career never upon account reject notion independent continued existence 
opinion taken deep root imagination impossible ever eradicate strained metaphysical conviction dependence perceptions sufficient purpose

order set ease particular contrive new hypothesis seems comprehend principles reason imagination 
hypothesis philosophical one double existence perceptions objects pleases reason allowing dependent perceptions interrupted different time agreeable imagination attributing continued existence something else call objects 
philosophical system therefore monstrous offspring two principles contrary embraced mind unable mutually destroy 
imagination tells us resembling perceptions continued uninterrupted existence annihilated absence 
reflection tells us even resembling perceptions interrupted existence different 
contradiction betwixt opinions elude new fiction conformable hypotheses reflection fancy ascribing contrary qualities different existences interruption perceptions continuance objects 
nature obstinate quit field however strongly attacked reason time reason clear point possibility disguising 
able reconcile two enemies endeavor set ease much possible successively granting whatever demands feigning double existence may find something conditions desires 
fully convinced resembling perceptions continued identical independent never run opinion double existence 
since find satisfaction first supposition would look beyond 
fully convinced perceptions dependent interrupted different little inclined embrace opinion double existence since case clearly perceive error first supposition continued existence would never regard farther 
therefore intermediate situation mind opinion arises adherence two contrary principles makes us seek pretext justify receiving happily last found system double existence 
another advantage philosophical system similarity vulgar one means humor reason moment becomes troublesome sollicitous yet upon least negligence inattention easily return vulgar natural notions 
accordingly find philosophers neglect advantage immediately upon leaving closets mingle rest mankind exploded opinions perceptions objects continue identically uninterruptedly interrupted appearances

first suppose external objects resemble internal perceptions

order therefore make two cases alike necessary remove part impression man feels hand organ sensation impossible simple impression obliges us remove whole proves whole impression archetype model external objects 
may add solidity necessarily supposes two bodies along contiguity impulse compound object never represented simple impression 
mention though solidity continues always invariably impressions touch change every moment upon us clear proof latter representations former

one principle already acknowledged 
every thing different distinguishable every thing distinguishable separable imagination

conclusion since perceptions different every thing else universe also distinct separable may considered separately existent may exist separately need thing else support existence 
therefore substances far definition explains substance

inclination fancy determined incorporate taste extended object reason shows us impossibility union 
divided betwixt opposite principles renounce neither one involve subject confusion obscurity longer perceive opposition 
suppose taste exists within circumference body manner fills whole without extension exists entire every part without separation 
short use familiar way thinking scholastic principle crudely proposed appears shocking totum toto tolum qualibet parte much say thing certain place yet 
absurdity proceeds endeavoring bestow place utterly incapable endeavor arises inclination compleat union founded causation contiguity time attributing objects conjunction place 
ever reason sufficient force overcome prejudice certain present case must prevail 
choice left either suppose beings exist without place figured extended incorporated extended objects whole whole whole every part 
absurdity two last suppositions proves sufficiently veracity first 
fourth opinion

though view things refuse condemn materialists conjoin thought extension yet little reflection show us equal reason blaming antagonists conjoin thought simple indivisible substance

make evident let us part ii sect 

remember every idea derived preceding perception impossible idea perception object external existence ever represent specifically different 
whatever difference may suppose betwixt still incomprehensible us obliged either conceive external object merely relation without relative make perception impression 
consequence shall draw may first sight appear mere sophism upon least examination found solid satisfactory 
say since may suppose never conceive specific deference betwixt object impression conclusion form concerning connexion repugnance impressions known certainly applicable objects hand whatever conclusions kind form concerning objects certainly applicable impressions 
reason difficult 
object supposed different impression sure circumstance upon found reasoning common supposing form reasoning upon impression 
still possible object may differ particular 
first form reasoning concerning object beyond doubt reasoning must extend impression quality object upon argument founded must least conceived mind coued conceived unless common impression since idea derived origin 
thus may establish certain maxim never principle irregular kind sect 
form coherence perceptions 
reasoning experience discover connexion repugnance betwixt objects extends impressions though inverse proposition may equally true discoverable relations impressions common objects 
apply present case two different systems presented suppose 
necessity assigning substance ground inhesion 
observe first universe objects body sun moon stars earth seas plants animals men ships houses productions either art nature 
spinoza appears tells modifications subject inhere simple incompounded indivisible 
consider system beings viz 
universe thought impressions ideas 
observe another sun moon stars earth seas covered inhabited plants animals towns houses mountains rivers short every thing discover conceive first system 
upon enquiring concerning theologians present tell also modifications modifications one simple uncompounded indivisible substance 
immediately upon deafened noise hundred voices treat first hypothesis detestation scorn second applause veneration 
turn attention hypotheses see may reason great partiality find fault unintelligible far understand much alike impossible discover absurdity one common 
idea quality object agree may represent quality impression ideas derived impressions 
never therefore find repugnance betwixt extended object modification simple uncompounded essence substance unless repugnance takes place equally betwixt perception impression extended object uncompounded essence 
every idea quality object passes impression therefore every perceivable relation whether connexion repugnance must common objects impressions 
though argument considered general seems evident beyond doubt contradiction yet make clear sensible let us survey detail see whether absurdities found system spinoza may likewise discovered theologians 
see bayle dictionary article spinoza 
first said spinoza according scholastic way talking rather thinking mode distinct separate existence must substance consequently extension universe must manner identifyed simple uncompounded essence universe supposed inhere 
may pretended utterly impossible inconceivable unless indivisible substance expand correspond extension extension contract answer indivisible substance 
argument seems far understand plain nothing required change terms apply argument extended perceptions simple essence soul ideas objects perceptions every respect attended supposition difference unknown incomprehensible 
secondly said idea substance applicable matter idea distinct substance applicable every distinct portion matter 
matter therefore mode substance part matter distinct mode distinct substance 
already proved perfect idea substance taking something exist evident every perception substance every distinct part perception distinct substance consequently one hypothesis labors difficulties respect 
thirdly objected system one simple substance universe substance support substratum every thing must instant modifyed forms contrary incompatible 
round square figures incompatible substance time 
possible substance modifyed square table round one ask question concerning impressions tables find answer satisfactory one case 
appears whatever side turn difficulties follow us advance one step towards establishing simplicity immateriality soul without preparing way dangerous irrecoverable atheism 
case instead calling thought modification soul give antient yet modish name action 
action mean much thing commonly called abstract mode something properly speaking neither distinguishable separable substance conceived distinction reason abstraction 
nothing gained change term modification action free one single difficulty means appear two following reflexions 
first observe word action according explication never justly applied perception derived mind thinking substance 
perceptions really different separable distinguishable everything else imagine therefore impossible conceive action abstract mode substance 
instance motion commonly made use shew manner perception depends action upon substance rather confounds instructs us 
motion appearance induces real essential change body varies relation objects 
betwixt person morning walking garden company agreeable person afternoon inclosed dungeon full terror despair resentment seems radical difference quite another kind produced body change situation 
conclude distinction separability ideas external objects separate existence make ideas objects must draw conclusion concerning according precedent reasoning 
least must confest idea substance soul impossible us tell admit differences even contrarieties perception without fundamental change consequently never tell sense perceptions actions substance 
use therefore word action unaccompanyed meaning instead modification makes addition knowledge advantage doctrine immateriality soul 
add second place brings advantage cause must bring equal cause atheism 
theologians pretend make monopoly word action may atheists likewise take possession affirm plants animals men c nothing particular actions one simple universal substance exerts blind absolute necessity say utterly absurd 
unintelligible time assert according principles explained impossible discover absurdity supposition various objects nature actions one simple substance absurdity applicable like supposition concerning impressions ideas 
hypotheses concerning substance local conjunction perceptions may pass another intelligible former important latter viz

latter conclusion contrary evident experience possible may like experience operations mind may perceive constant conjunction thought motion reason hastily mere consideration ideas conclude impossible motion ever produce thought different position parts give rise different passion reflection 
nay possible may experience certain since every one may perceive different dispositions body change thoughts sentiments 
said depends union soul body would answer must separate question concerning substance mind concerning cause thought confining latter question find comparing ideas thought motion different experience constantly united circumstances enter idea cause effect applied operations matter may certainly conclude motion may actually cause thought perception 
seems dilemma left us present case either assert nothing cause another mind perceive connexion idea objects maintain objects find constantly conjoined upon account regarded causes effects 
choose first part dilemma consequences 
first reality affirm thing universe cause productive principle even deity since idea supreme derived particular impressions none contain efficacy seem connexion existence 
may said connexion betwixt idea infinitely powerful effect wills necessary unavoidable answer idea endowed power much less one endowed infinite power 
change expressions define power connexion saying idea infinitely powerful connected every effect wills really assert whose volition connected every effect connected every effect identical proposition gives us insight nature power connexion 
secondly supposing deity great efficacious principle supplies deficiency causes leads us grossest impieties absurdities 
upon account recourse natural operations assert matter communicate motion produce thought viz 
apparent connexion betwixt objects say upon account must acknowledge deity author volitions perceptions since apparent connexion either one another supposed unknown substance soul 
agency supreme know asserted father malebranche cartesians 
several philosophers relation actions mind except volition rather inconsiderable part volition though easy perceive exception mere pretext avoid dangerous consequences 
doctrine 
nothing active apparent power thought case active matter inactivity must make us recourse deity supreme real cause actions bad well good vicious well virtuous 
thus necessarily reduced side dilemma viz 

objects found constantly conjoined upon account regarded causes effects 
objects contrary susceptible constant conjunction real objects contrary follows ought determine mere ideas thing may cause effect thing evidently gives advantage materialists antagonists 
pronounce final decision upon whole question concerning substance soul absolutely unintelligible perceptions susceptible local union either extended unextended one kind constant conjunction objects constitutes essence cause effect matter motion may often regarded causes thought far notion relation 
certainly kind indignity philosophy whose sovereign authority ought every acknowledged oblige every occasion make apologies conclusions justify every particular art science may offended 
puts one mind king arrainged high treason subjects 
one occasion philosophy think necessary even honorable justify religion may seem least offended whose rights dear indeed

object may imagined become entirely inactive annihilated moment evident principle whatever imagine possible 
true matter spirit extended compounded substance simple unextended 
cases metaphysical arguments immortality soul equally inconclusive cases moral arguments derived analogy nature equally strong convincing

therefore different origin must proceed like operation imagination upon like objects 
lest argument convince reader though opinion perfectly decisive let weigh following reasoning still closer immediate 
evident identity attribute human mind however perfect may imagine able run several different perceptions one make lose characters distinction difference essential 
still true every distinct perception enters composition mind distinct existence different distinguishable separable every perception either contemporary successive 
notwithstanding distinction separability suppose whole train perceptions united identity question naturally arises concerning relation identity whether something really binds several perceptions together associates ideas imagination 
words whether pronouncing concerning identity person observe real bond among perceptions feel one among ideas form 
question might easily decide would recollect already proud large understanding never observes real connexion among objects even union cause effect strictly examined resolves customary association ideas 
thence evidently follows identity nothing really belonging different perceptions uniting together merely quality attribute union ideas imagination reflect upon 
qualities give ideas union imagination three relations mentioned 
uniting principles ideal world without every distinct object separable mind may separately considered appears connexion object disjoined greatest difference remoteness 
therefore three relations resemblance contiguity causation identity depends essence relations consists producing easy transition ideas follows notions personal identity proceed entirely smooth uninterrupted progress thought along train connected ideas according principles explained
