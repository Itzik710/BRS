thar lots uv wolves woods injun kinds know yourn rest henry 
take big risks said paul 
said henry quickly vanished sight among bushes 
two hundred yards away stopped could hear moving 
expected sound would come knowing would lie wholly still long time awaiting passage indian lines 
heart great youth swelled within 
truly son wilderness primitive man thousands years ago civilization begun depended upon acuteness senses protect monstrous wild beasts much home ordinary man felt city streets faced great task without apprehension certain delight 
indian cunning white man intellect well eager match wits cunning warriors 
would glad night turned little darker full burnished moon showers stars gave promise must rely upon judgment seek shadows pass lay thickest 
forest spread magnificent oak beech elm great size moonlight starshine shone trunks moving objects would almost conspicuous day 
hence sought brushwood advancing swiftly shelter approached place comfortable home five thought wise abandon 
whimsical fancy desire repay evil seized 
would draw warriors would annoy tantalize 
would make think evil spirits sport 
half mile sank earth lying still anyone yard away could heard breathe 
two warriors stood boughs oak looking direction hollow 
doubt watchers posted prevent flight besieged direction shaken silent laughter spectacle men stood guard none might pass none pass 
already revenge upon trouble causing felt task repayment beginning well 
two shawnees walked back forth little searching everything questing eyes speak 
presently turned somewhat one side henry still using shelter brushwood flitted silently past 
three four hundred yards farther lay laughing 
ridiculously easy 
wild instincts alive leaping senses became preternaturally acute 
heard tiny animals cat tribe alarmed presence stealing away among bushes sound owl moving ever slightly thick leaves bough came ears 
still owl became still know arose moved 
henry believed two warriors merely guards outer rim soon would encounter belief verified within ten minutes 
heard talking saw braxton wyatt three shawnees one large man seemed second command 
lying ease good covert watched laughing 
truth fine sport enjoyed utmost 
wyatt looking toward point cliffs contained rocky hollow showed dimly silver haze 
face expressed neither triumph confidence henry seeing troubled enjoyed 
wish knew well provided food ammunition heard say 
plenty big warrior said 
mighty young chief ware see 
henry felt thrill words 
shawnee paying tribute could keep hearing 
beat us said wyatt gloomily 
trapped hollow could carry 
time said warrior sit wait come trembling weakness begging us give food may keep life bodies 
sight make eyes heart rejoice said braxton wyatt 
hammer trigger henry rifle powerful magnet hand 
young renegade voice expressed much revenge malice much accumulated poison world would much better place without 
rid presence stood outlined sharp clear silver dusk marksman henry could miss 
restrained eager fingers 
wise could shoot even renegade ambush 
using extremest caution lest moving leaf blade grass betray presence passed sure well within indian ring 
advancing rapidly ascended slope came hollow reached yet cover 
waited long time see whether wyatt posted sentinels within eyeshot earshot desire trapped inside feeling sure near entered 
home undisturbed 
dead ashes last fire lay untouched 
various articles could take undisturbed rocky shelves 
gave interior rapid questing looks went outside mind set dense clump bushes grew near entrance 
buried heavy shade seek alone shelter 
saw good line retreat led shoulder hill slope admitted good speed 
made sure ground filled lungs sent forth cry wolf long sinister full power carried far forest 
knew listening four would hear knew would reach ears braxton wyatt shawnees 
hearing would absolutely sure five hollow might held dropped dead hunger yielded mercy knew mercy 
fierce triumphant yells came points circle deep content henry laughed 
would fool would play meanwhile comrades keep sport going might sting flank 
yells night resumed usual silence henry lying covert watched sides laid plans vex torment braxton wyatt band 
knew easy matter comrades escape particular expedition sent likely would encounter larger forces farther south wished battlefield shifted shift northward 
hence intended hold wyatt long possible 
sure saw tops bushes moving direction wind equally sure shawnees coming forward 
nearly half hour passed bead fire appeared rifle discharged shot uncommonly loud sound clear noiseless night 
heard click bullet struck stone near mouth hollow laughed 
amusing night 
warriors crept within range would sure sprinkle stone around cleft bullets lead precious wilderness wasted 
flattened upon earth merely keeping rifle thrust forward emergency blended perfectly grass foliage even keen eyes shawnees ten feet away could detected 
second shot fired heard bullet clipping leaves far away third followed volley bullets striking point near entrance 
volley followed long fierce war whoop far valley henry caught sight dusky form 
quick lightning raised rifle pulled trigger figure disappeared 
another war whoop expressing grief rage came knew band would think bullet sent mouth rock fortress 
crept little farther away lest stalker stumble upon reloaded rifle 
lay quite still long time first sound heard slow cautious footsteps 
listened attentively wondered 
warrior surely would come walking manner soon became shambling 
putting ear earth heard soft uncertain crush crush raising head little traced dark ambiguous figure 
knew nevertheless two red eyes blinking doubt dismay 
black bear doubtless one already disturbed 
like henry within shawnee ring unlike free 
shots war whoops terrified utmost always driven back toward center circle 
henry moved spirit much friendliness sport uttered low woof 
bear paused raised head little higher inhaled wind 
time would fled dismay human odor harried frightened black bear woof first friendly sound heard day 
remained figure crouched red eyes quivering curiosity 
henry smiled 
feeling animal one pure friendship allied sympathy 
knew bear tried plunge indian ring panic would certainly kill 
moreover would cook eat next day 
indians liked fat young bear better venison 
whimsical impulse generous nature try save bear edged around puzzled animal mouth cave 
bear started run west rifle shot fired suddenly segment circle stopped 
remained undecided tongue lolling red eyes full dismay 
henry crept slowly toward uttering low woof woof several times bruin disturbed mind unable judge friends enemies edged away slowly back almost mouth hollow 
possibilities combination chances occurred nevertheless 
louder woof usual followed almost instantly shawnee rifle shot frightened bear giving back almost fell crevice 
whirling seeing refuge darted inside 
henry retreating dense bushes flattened grass laughed 
laughed many times night mirth fresh savor 
bear indians become new occupant old home despite fact recently human habitation felt quite sure animal owing terror confusion ideas would remain morning least 
shawnees would exert patience skill siege one bear lived chiefly roots greatest crime rob bees stored honey 
raised could see mouth cave still dark 
evidently bear home using available comforts 
would come face terror shots human faces 
henry could imagine head almost hidden one beds leaves gradually acquiring confidence danger longer eyes 
whimsical little impulse met complete success lay shroud bushes intense enjoyment thrilled every vein 
known happier night 
primitive instincts gratified 
hunted sport hunters rare sport 
mournful howl wolf came faintly northern rim forest 
made henry start wonder little 
thought first cry sent forth silent tom shif less sol inside indian circle concluded must made one warriors 
changed mind long whining cry repeated 
hearing less acute sight able differentiate finest shades sound felt sure howl wolf made wolf real genuine article howls true wilderness 
several uneasy whines came doubt left longer 
indian ring enclosed rocky hollow black bear also enclosed entire pack wolves 
complicated situation wyatt band henry spontaneous laugh bubbled throat 
inferred seen indian force 
probably detachments west north drawn complete ring care many might 
greater troubles 
soft pad pad thicket roused keenest attention 
larger animal approaching unaware presence wind blowing wrong direction 
wind came right henry soon discovered strong feline odor 
knew panther presently saw moonlight yellowish monstrous hugest beast kind ever beheld 
panther despite size strength would run away man henry understood 
indian ring closed frightened seeking refuge 
powerful clawed toothed battle would fight unless driven corner would fight ferocity 
henry reflected philosophically net might miss particular fish cast yet catch others 
indians closed panther black bear perhaps pack wolves

red eagle speak strips meat cooked eaten sitting fire arose addressed slow solemn weighty manner 
henry would given much understand words believed referred five might tell chief plans far away hear anything except murmur meant nothing 
saw however red eagle intensely earnest warriors listened fixed attention hanging every word watching face 
interruptions exclamations approval finished sat together uttered deep notes

hear bands signaling surmised one south would pass around southern end lake reuniting soon afterward possible 
nevertheless curved direction sinking long walk went steadily ahead great sun went sea gold behind forest night threw dusky veil wilderness 
stopped entirely standing huge tree trunk figure blended night took deep breaths 
first felt weakness

world steadied heart ceased beat hard suffusion blood retreated head 
saw nothing heard anything foes knew pursuit would cease 
felt great flight one might go days nights every faculty would tested utmost willing 
longer flight continued would draw away indian power wished 
would make fugitive chiefs never known 
henry stood full fifteen minutes beside brown trunk tree dark seemed part great physical power elasticity time sufficient restore strength 
thought caught glimpse bush moving behind resumed long running walk covered ground rapidly 
hour later came brook bed walked fully mile

following day still warmer seeing several smokes east west became convinced forest full warriors

new stream seemed lead general direction wished go deep enough canoe turned paddled toward southwest going twenty miles narrow rather deep channel 
stopped night dark came saw several smokes satisfaction note eastward seeming indicate flanked bands 
usual took canoe water laid among bushes finding similar covert near ate food rested arms shoulders wearied long labors paddle 
warmest night since big freeze sleepy finishing supper went somewhat farther usual woods looking anything particular partly exercise legs become somewhat cramped long day canoe 
became much alive heard crash knew falling tree 
leaped instantly shelter great trunk hand sprang gunlock sound followed wondered 
first thought indicated presence warriors indians cut trees doubtless due cause perhaps old decayed trunk weighted snow falling sheer weariness 
event going see emerging shelter moved forward silently 
came thicket saw beyond wide pool backwater formed tributary creek 
water stood beaver colony round domes houses showing like happy village 
evident however much delayed work winter half dozen stalwart fellows busy tree falling crash henry heard cut sharp teeth 
crouched thicket unsuspected industrious members colony watched little 
know building operation intended must thought 
beaver always industrious full foresight adding construction town carried earlier year must due prevision going cold long hard winter 
henry watched work quite furnished amusement interest 
sort forest idyll 
energy marvelous worked always method 
one huge gray old fellow seemed direct movements henry soon saw able master tolerated neither impudence trifling 
town everybody work work leader directed 
gave hidden forest runner keen pleasure watch village ordered life industry happiness 
felt sense kinship animals 
thoughtful youth often occurred world might made well man 
beaver animal uncommon intelligence could learn 
big gray fellow general ability perhaps touch genius 
soldiers working according directions uncommon skill dispatch 
henry concentrated attention upon presently feeling leader saw known time lying thicket afraid convinced would harm 
added pleasure think 
old fellow looked directly least half dozen times presently henry compelled laugh 
sure living big old beaver raised head little higher water usual glancing way winked 
forgot everything else play beaver king king surely time direct direct ably activities village also carry kind wireless talk forest runner 
henry watched see would give wink sure day day dived presently came near edge pool wiped dripping water head face winked gravely left eye expression moment uncommonly like human 
henry startled 
certainly seemed real 
fancy vivid knew 
circumstances unusual influences certain remarkable instances strong upon

winked great astonishment delight old king winked 
beaver feeling condescended enough time dived came far side pool infused new energy subject series rapid commands hurried forward work 
henry delight remained 
old king willing put forest runner equality winking 
two superior others king alone aware presence 
since monarch distinctly winked several times likely would wink twice enough done dignity sake 
waited great patience 
little king seemed forgotten existence repented condescension apparently gave wholly tasks kingship telling work done urging apprehensive another freeze might occur could finished 
fine old fellow full wisdom experience decision henry began fear forgotten crush duties pertaining throne 
ten minutes gray king dived came second time near side pool 
quite evident winking henry winked back vigor 
beaver began swim slowly back forth doubtful fashion something mind 
humorous look henry persuaded seen eye faded 
glance expressed indecision apprehension even henry feeling kinship strong upon strove divine cousin beaver thinking 
thinking thinking ten minutes quite evident youth wondered could cause change abrupt radical 
caught beaver eye surely old king troubled 
look said plain day henry danger must beware 
beaver suddenly raised struck water three powerful blows broad flat tail 
reports sounded like rifle shots echo last one died great wise king people sank like stone beneath water come view disappearing royal palace otherwise domed hut stone hard mud 
subjects shot sight time henry saw domes beaver houses silent pool 
never doubted instant royal warning intended well beaver people instantly slid back deeper thicket dozen shawnee warriors footsteps making noise came woods side looked beaver pool 
chapter xv letter henry quite sure beaver king given direct warning never liked afterward disturb impair belief moreover alive gratitude bound 
lying perfectly still depths thicket watched indians powerful warriors nevertheless showed signs strain travel 
doubtless come edge lake believed suddenly certainty conviction following 
back trail unexplained manner struck merely lose 
chance brought opposite sides pond alone received warning 
stood water edge three four minutes looking beaver houses talking although henry far away understand said 
knew would remain long next vital moment 
chance come way would spring run went another might lie still think problem 
leader gave word command dropping usual single file marched silently south 
henry lay north side pool last warriors sight rose walked back canoe must reluctantly abandon 
could think continuing water proof eye many warriors woods creek 
canoe served well 
saved often weariness sometimes exhaustion dire need barred 
put painted coat made blankets provisions pack fastened back hid light craft among weeds bushes creek margin struck swift pace toward west south 
bands would surely follow believe indian hosts could got together pursuit capture 
great failure flight pursuit northward would melt away largely winter would thin new chase yet 
thought less danger four brave comrades separated long anxious rejoin 
likely left oasis come long distance north another serious problems confronted day day 
wilderness vast four men like proverbial needle haystack 
henry trusted luck mind luck rather favor greater powers watched flight withdrawn protection return king beavers shown 
following day fled southward despite heavy pack carried made great speed 
judged winter severe since melting great snow encountered way toward lake slept next night lee hill blankets painted coat still sufficient comfort 
noon next day coming low ground mostly wilderness bushes reeds heard shots soon discovered came rifles muskets indians hunting buffalo deer could easily escape marshes 
fear leaving trail sure seen soft ground lay close dense thicket bushes night fortunately dark came 
made cover darkness saw indian fires right left 
passed close one right heard warriors singing song plenty indicating day yielded rich store deer buffalo 
indians delicate feeders would probably eat could eat lying stupor fire would sleep morning 
stop midnight slept protection steep hill advancing next day country seemed swarm warriors evidently taking advantage weather refill wigwams must become bare food 
henry knowing danger tripled advanced slowly traveling usually night lying close covert day 
supplies food fell low night edge stream shot deer came drink carried away best portions body 
took risk believed indians heard shot would think fired one number least would think long enough escape new precious supplies 
correct calculations able detect trace immediate pursuit building low fire two hills cooked ate tender piece deer meat 
night saw faint light horizon believing came indian camp decided stalk 
placing supplies inside blankets painted robe fastened whole pack high bough tree manner roving wild animal could get advanced toward light grew larger approached 
also became evident soon camp inferred much larger one original supposition 
pitched valley sake shelter cold winds western side dense thicket henry advanced 
indians keeping watch nothing guard able come near could see whole bowl fully two hundred warriors sat great fire eating kinds game enjoying full warmth food savage life 
henry although natural foes felt certain sympathy 
understood feelings 
gone long villages half starved great snow great cold lasted midst plenty obtained skill tenacity hunting 
rejoiced supplied wants primeval man 
scene wild savage last degree 
warriors heat fires thrown blankets bare waist brown bodies heavily painted gleaming firelight 
every man roasted broiled huge pieces buffalo deer wild turkey coals sat ground turkish fashion ate 
intervals warrior would spring feet waving aloft great buffalo bone would dance back forth chanting meanwhile fierce song war chase 
others would join dozen perhaps twenty would leaping contorting bodies singing seized madness 
remainder went feast seemed ending 
wind rose little blew chill forest 
dry boughs rustled one another flames wavered roared louder drafts air fanned greater strength 
warriors heated heaps coals vast quantities food devouring felt cold 
instead remaining wore blankets threw solid array naked brown bodies glistening paint heat 
innumerable sparks rose fires floated high overhead die clear cold skies 
group singers dancers ceased another took place fierce weird chant never stopped wintry forest continually giving back echoes 
wilderness spectacle remarkable fascination henry understood well knowing little danger men spending time festival crept closer still well hidden dense thicket 
pulses gave great leap four figures side fire came distinctly view 
red eagle head chief shawnees yellow panther head chief miamis renegades braxton wyatt moses blackstaffe pursued long tenacity 
talking earnestly crept edge thicket scarcely three feet divided open 
knew chance would bring four near enough understand words half hour waiting chance came 
blackstaffe took precedence wyatt superior years experience talking subject chance coincidence bringing henry 
warriors discovered white trail trail one said renegade know ware may perished great freeze well rid dangerous foe eye always watched movements bold spirit always takes alarm settlements 
give full credit skill courage rather bones lying forest picked clean wolves 
henry felt little thrill satisfaction 
picked clean wolves wolves saved think dead said braxton wyatt 
know believe understand better

idea back lake somewhere trail warriors found another five perhaps traces fellow shif less sol 
henry pulse leaped joy 
shiftless one taken slain doubtless none others either would referred 
waited hear dead leaf twig stirred thicket still 
seems strange said blackstaffe thoughtfully able take thousand warriors hunt carried without stopping except big snow big freeze 
warriors best west men come pretty near seeing trail air men without fear 
almost seems something miraculous 
one chiefs spoke first time yellow panther miami 
blackstaffe spoken truth said 
ware helped evil spirits spirits evil us else could slipped traps often 
powerful medicine calls aid danger surrounds 
yellow panther spoke gravity earnestness became great miami chief finished looked skies fugitive summoned spirits help 
great shawnee chief red eagle standing side nodded emphatic confirmation 
henry felt peculiar quiver run blood 
really received miraculous help two chiefs thought lying place time much make think 
spread mighty net caught nothing said braxton wyatt deep disappointment showing tone 
failed get leader five failed take single one 
henry heart gave great leap 
inferred comrades yet safe positive proof words wyatt 
ever feared might known drew indian power would able take care 
think said blackstaffe better continue march south also keep large force north 
stumble upon week two chance gone least next spring 
wild fowl flew south early old men women tribes foretold longest hardest winter two generations 
yellow panther cold great warriors seek wigwams replied miami chief stay many days nights hanging fires 
war trail deserted ice king rule forest 
doubt old men old women right said braxton wyatt make shiver tell say 
perhaps spirits turn side give five hands 
moved hearing henry knew enough 
comrades untaken understood plan campaign 
four could evade little longer mighty winter would shut would end 
glad come spy upon host 
rewarded richly hoped 
crept silently away long time whenever looked back still saw luminous glow great fires dusky horizon 
sure warriors would come come trained faculties would give warning time slept thicket within two miles camp 
dawn southern trail knowing indian host would soon course though going slowly 
trail lay east led north country general character 
everywhere save little prairies wooded densely countless streams whether creeks brooks swollen winter thaw 
desire rejoin comrades strong upon henry began look proofs region 
knew confidence absolute faith would elude pursuit return time 
therefore would waiting wherever passed would leave signs hope might see 
fled watched enemies trail friends 
compelled swim large river cold great risked everything built fire warmed dried staying nearly two hours 
half hour left saw distant smoke right smoke equally distant left 
smoke ascending spiral rings knew talking together

fantastic mood seized decided take part conversation 
passing one blankets back forth fire sent series rings sometimes regular intervals long breaks 
weird drunken chain signals knew would set indians right indians left wondering

complicated signals ever sent wilderness enjoyed perplexity warriors utmost saw talking one another also trying frantically talk 
said said complicated way said smoke right smoke left began sweep around gusts indignation disappointment

although meant nothing one could imagine meant anything everything 
frantic call help insistent message trail fugitive discovered merely wild statement night going cold next day either exchange compliments whatever saw things chose imagine 
hoping intensely braxton wyatt blackstaffe either side henry felt sure true ready eager hope turn belief fact rejoiced anew vexation laughing silently long 
abruptly kicked coals apart smothered smoke taking pack fled much amused much heartened efforts 
could remember spent enjoyable half hour 
maintained flight far midnight coming stony ground found excellent shelter great ledge one projecting widely awoke morning found raining quite dry 
poured heavily afternoon stir covert wrapped painted coat blankets taking occasional strips deer meat enjoyed period rest 
rained hard could see fifty yards away ravine ledge water ran cold stream 
forest looked desolate mournful would desolate mournful single fact able keep dry

rain stopped followed extremely cold night froze everything tight 
every tree bush earth covered glittering ice vast intricate network wilderness white silver

would walk ice passed thickets fragments ice brushed twigs would fall 
least ice age returned 
sure make game scarce animals would stay coverts long could time must replenish supplies food soon 
difficulty gave passing thought 
others pressed upon immediate force 
moccasins become worn long use slipped ice glass 
met difficulty cutting pieces one blankets tying tightly feet thin strips buckskin garments 
able walk without slipping made good progress forest exertion travel keeping warm 
meanwhile watched everywhere sign sign four keeping especial eye trees upon forest runners wrote letters one another 
soul craved letter really know intensely craved 
bonds friendship united five ties countless hardships dangers shared one would hesitated instant risk life one others 
characteristic henry patience thoroughness though found nothing kept looking 
wanted letter wanted long much concentration began believe would find

henry still looked 
dark would come soon must abandon search word seek shelter instead 
hope still high would find night closed 
red glow deepest saw core heart looking

noon came vast shallow flooded area third mile across extending farther north south could see either way 
doubtless four crossed heavy rains made flood unwilling take long circuit north south decided make passage ice thick strong 
free danger time took little thought absent mind came 
well upon ice heard crack rifle behind bullet whizzed ear

considering victim secure trap would reckon time value would take unnecessary risk 
believed hunting bands trailed directly encounter chance piece bad fortune nothing expect long run good fortune 
warriors different bands sent far signals one another across ice slowly care party built large fire around men sat basking heat cry two taunting fugitive considered tight trap

four warriors either shore went upon ice time began advance slowly toward island making use clumps bushes thrust frozen surface lagoon

henry reloaded second time patted affectionately rifle served well put front sheltered hands blankets 
bands received dreadful lesson 
loss two good warriors passed lightly knew would delay time taking action 
meanwhile night coming fast cold increasing greatly alarmed despite blankets painted robe 
wind sweeping frozen surface lagoon edge cut like steel 
blood veins seemed grow chill felt alarm lest hands grow stiff cold handle rifle 
bushes although hid distant enemy afford much protection 
instead like many icicles 
two bands built fires higher flames threw glow far ice henry saw hovering figures outlined black red 
filled anger could maintain siege comfort fight human foe paralyzing cold well

second time took violent physical exercise drive away creeping paralyzing cold resolved upon plan burst trap 
night fairly dark streamers cloud floating across heavens might grow darker
