liberated prisoners airlifted litchfield 
third day battle conn father sylvie father flew litchfield 
conn surprise flora greeted cordially wade lucas rather stiffly congratulated 
maybe tom brangwyn said poictesme last four five years know bad things gotten 
mother seemed think battle barathrum single handed 
even surprised gratified flora made friends sylvie immediately 
mother however regarded engineer daughter badly concealed hostility seemed doubt sylvie kind girl wanted son getting involved 
outwardly course quite gracious 
rodney maxwell yves jacquemont flew storisende next morning optimistic finding ship conn thought circumstances warranted 
conn stayed home next days luxuriating idleness 
sylvie tore mother household robots built sound sensors keying respond names simple commands including recorded voice responses thick sheshan accent 
smart people terra explained sheshan humanoid servants 
mother delighted 
robots would answer spoke lot companionable 
seem think however sylvie mechanical skills ladylike accomplishments 
nice girls litchfield model quite handy spot welder 
conn liked sylvie like girls known university 
strolling dinner mall 
air sharp warned autumn definitely arrived many brilliant stars almost bright moon terra coming dusk 
conn thing merlin began 
really believe ever since dad came poictesme hearing story tempted tell truth sternly put temptation behind 
course merlin sylvie going wonderful things find 
looked starlit mall ahead 
somebody maybe lester dawes morgan gatworth lorenzo menardes gotten things finished cleaned 
pavement smooth unbroken litter vanished 
done wonderful things already people started looking said 
days going realize merlin along know 
faint humming somewhere ahead wondering 
came long escalators saw running 
look got fixed running sylvie grinned squeezed arm 
get chum said 
course merlin 
maybe tell truth 
returned house mother greeted conn father trying get ever since went 
call right away ritz gartner hotel storisende 
something ship 
look little time get father screen 
excited happy 
hi conn one said 
kind ship know 
harriet barne 
expected 
something mothball row would flown barathrum torn completely rebuilt one already partly finished 
dickens wangle oh yves idea start 
knew losing money years 
said pay prize money either restore original condition finish job build spaceship want would almost bankrupt company 
got high fifty thousand sols prize money laughed 
made proposition 
proposed organizing new company subsidiary l e engage interplanetary shipping companies assign equity harriet barne new company work completing done spaceport labor cost shared 
would give us spaceship get hook around 
everybody except president know anything conn shook head 
father continued name jethro sastraman 
could play scrooge christmas carol without makeup 
new idea since got college war still going 
preposterous utterly visionary impractical father mimicked 
fortunately majority big stockholders agree finally bullied agreeing 
calling new company alpha interplanetary application charter go almost automatically 
going president new company know 
character named rodney maxwell 
yves going vice president charge operations flying barathrum tomorrow next day gang technicians recruiting 
giving us clyde nichols mack vibart lot men shipyard 
staying storisende opening office 
time next week going wish born quintuplets 
conn maxwell suppose influential non office holding stockholder right 
like l e xii found jerry rivas anse dawes score workmen making survey inventory spaceport 
captain nichols four original crew harriet barne shared captivity among pirates stayed take care ship 
fred karski one gun cutter couple light airboats keeping routine guard

next day yves jacquemont arrived accompanied mack vibart gang shipyard dozen engineers construction men recruited around storisende 
workers arrived next days including number already worked ship slaves perales gang 
take conn long appreciate problems involved conversion

spaceships either interplanetary interstellar always spherical pseudogravity system center 
course harriet barne lacked 
well going make whole trip free fall wanted know 
use acceleration pseudograv halfway deceleration half jacquemont told 
free fall ten fifteen hours 
going lift poictesme horizontal position ship designed make ninety degree turn planet lift drive working together like one old rocket ships abbott drive developed 
meant course bulkheads would become decks explained lot oddities noticed conversion job 
meant everything would mounted gimbals everything stowed secure either position nothing placed would reach either 
jacquemont nichols took charge work ship 
chief engineer vibart gang half taught self taught untaught helpers went back working engines tearing safety devices intended keep ship inside planetary atmosphere arranging lift engines could swung line drive engines

anything worry either 
harriet barne better half finished

spaceship building storisende got news screen appeared work progressing rapidly

one construction seemed cruciform design like old fashioned pre contragravity winged airplane 
design puzzled everybody barathrum 
yves jacquemont thought perhaps would decks cross arm would used ship running combined lift drive 
well till get shipyard going koshchei build real spaceships going rare looking objects traveling around alpha system

long take conn asked 
find plutonium find robots work inside structural damage keep couple days 
right let get

neither converter reactor sustained damage fissionables burning 
robots began tearing reactor elements removing plutonium slugs longer capable sustaining chain reaction still dangerously radioactive 
nuclear reactors become simpler easier service since first day year zero enrico fermi put first one operation principles remained 
work less back breaking muscle straining called intense concentration screens meters buttons less exhausting

yes 
fifty foot shaft top mesa almost top underground headquarters 
found something top headquarters disc shaped mass fifty feet thick hundred across armored collapsium 
directly used foxx travis office 
tenth big enough anything could even resemble merlin 
well something 
day yesterday 
collapsium top thing rode shaft jeep looked 
look conn know project merlin lore merlin grown since war pure supposition 
foxx travis told categorically merlin project conn said 
war forty years military secret longer 
would lie lie kurt fawzi others tell merlin lied telling truth would hurt 
maybe travis reason lying 
maybe merlin dangerous anybody allowed find 
great ghu beginning think merlin devil frankenstein monster might something bad 
maybe worse 
think man like foxx travis would lie overriding moral obligation 
know making trouble us lucas added 
yes rodney maxwell said 
sometime going invite klem zareff kick pants seat
