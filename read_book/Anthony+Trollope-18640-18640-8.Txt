conclusion volume chapter temptation circumstances general election well remembered take interest political matters country 
coming going ministers previous somewhat rapid exciting upon whole useful showing real feeling country upon sundry questions public interest 
mr gresham prime minister england representative liberal party politics 
come split among followers terribly vexed question ballot 
mr daubeny twelve months sat upon throne distributing good things crown amidst conservative birdlings beaks wide open craving maws certainly years previous received share state honors state emoluments 
mr daubeny still sitting infinite dismay liberals every man felt party entitled numerical strength keep management government within hands 
let man side may politics unless much partisan patriot think well equity division bestowal crumbs comfort 
even old whig wish every lord lieutenant county old whig good administration law none liberal lawyers become attorney generals thence chief justices lords appeal conservative peer ever represent majesty england india canada st petersburgh arguing moderate liberals glad give mr daubeny merry men chance 
mr daubeny merry men neglected chance given 
fortune favored made hay sun shone energy never surpassed improving upon fortune till natural enemies waxed impatient 
yet one year natural enemies first expressed glad turn come might endured period spoliation equanimity 
liberals cutting whitehall cake conservatives spoliation privilege cutting found much exceeded expected 
liberals real representatives people therefore cake truth appertain given cake partly indeed idleness mismanagement quarrelling among mainly feeling moderate slicing side would upon whole advantageous cake came mauled like oh heavens men quarrelled agreed quarrel decided end mismanagement idleness horrid sight weak pretending strong weak receiving reward strength brought end 
came great fight last agonies cake sliced manfully 
world knew fight would go meantime lord lieutenancies arranged ancient judges retired upon pensions vice royal governors sent last gasp failing battle great places filled tens little places twenties private secretaries established hay still made even sun gone 
consequence circumstances election peculiar 
mr daubeny dissolved house probably idea could thus retrieve fortunes feeling occupying last normal position properly fought constitutional battle 
enemies resolved firmly resolved knock altogether head general election called existence 
disgracefully voted house commons various subjects 
last occasion gone lobby minority upon motion brought forward mr palliser late liberal chancellor exchequer respecting decimal coinage 
politician even mr palliser expected would carry bill present session 
brought forward trial strength purpose decimal coinage good subject 
mr palliser hobby gratified opportunity ventilating 
power succeeded carrying measure awed last absolutely beaten infinite difficulty encountered arranging details 
mind still set upon allowed whole party good anything else purpose required 
conservative government beaten third fourth time mr daubeny dissolved house 
whole world said might well resigned 
already end july must autumn session new members 
known impossible find supported majority fresh election 
treated manifest forbearance cake left hands twelve months house barely two years old cry meet country dissolution factious dishonest unconstitutional 
said liberals deduced also conservatives hearts angry opponents 
gained poor interval three months clever men suggested mr daubeny scheme head sharp trick political conjuring hocus pocus presto sleight hand might able retain power let elections go would 
certainly make scheme known party 
cry meet country indeed leaders opposition 
retrenchment army reform navy excellence mr palliser decimal coinage general good government gave old whig moderate liberals plenty matter speeches future constituents 
advanced could promise ballot suggest disestablishment church 
government day turned score general incompetence 
made go could command majorities 
ought dissolution mr daubeny regarded opponents indeed many followers also enmity almost ferocious 
seat parliament five six years blessing blessing becomes questionable sought afresh every session 
one thing manifest thoughtful working eager political liberals 
must majority next parliament majority good men men good true 
must mismanagement quarrelling idleness 
borne unprincipled called conservative prime minister go slicing cake fashion lately adopted old bishops even talked resigning knights garter seemed die purpose 
great stir liberal political clubs every good true man summoned battle 
liberal soldier young soldier known good true mr finn irishman held office two years ago satisfaction friends retired office found compelled support measure since carried men obliged account divide 
always felt old friends ill used least unfortunate 
twelve months advance party consequently driven cold 
names good men true mustered weighed discussed scrutinised active members liberal party certain private room far removed great seat parliamentary warfare capabilities expediencies possibilities tossed fro among active members came pass name mr finn mentioned 
mr phineas finn gentleman name statement may necessary explain term endearment occasionally used speaking 
got permanent place said mr ratler living well founded hope treasury secretary new dispensation course leave 
must acknowledged mr ratler judge matters possessed experience always afraid phineas finn

phineas finn lost father well wife inherited four thousand pounds 
time much thirty must acknowledged regard since day accepted place retired london soul sighed lost glories westminster downing street 
certain modes life adopted make contentment circumstances almost impossibility 
old age man may retire without repining though often beyond power even old man youth faculties still perfect body still strong hopes still buoyant change made phineas finn men could bear equanimity 
revelled gas light could lie quiet sunny bank 
palate accustomed high cookery bread milk almost painfully insipid 
phineas finn found discharging dublin routine duties office public comment feeling duties done face country became sick heart discontented

six seven pleasant days phineas finn spent harrington hall started alone lonely tankerville 
admitted pleasure received visit quite sufficient qualify running risk attempt return kind life formerly led 
fail tankerville would become chapter iv tankerville great mr molescroft came tankerville purpose introducing hero electors mr ruddles local liberal agent employed 
met lambton arms phineas established knowing well ten days unmitigated vexation misery 
tankerville dirty prosperous ungainly town seemed exude coal dust coal mud every pore 
well recognized dirty people expect meet clean hands faces 
linen never white tankerville even ladies sat drawing rooms accustomed feel taste appearance soot daintiest recesses 
hear oil city flavor petroleum hardly considered disagreeable flavor coal tankerville 
know oil city flavor petroleum must openly declared objectionable coal tankerville 
tankerville coal much loved thought dirty 
mr ruddles much begrimed leading liberal electors upon phineas finn already called seemed saturated product district 
would however event duty live tankerville believed first moment entrance town would soon depart know 
felt chance elected quite forlorn hope could hardly understand allowed embarrassed unprofitable speculation 
phineas finn thrice chosen sit parliament twice irish borough loughshane english borough loughton happy hitherto known nothing miseries occasional hopelessness contested election 
loughton come forward nominee earl brentford returned without chance failure nobleman influence 
loughshane things nearly pleasant 
almost taught think nothing could easier getting parliament man could live 
loughton loughshane gone many comfortable things old days found relegated borough seemed sent fight might win necessary party seat allowed lost without fighting 
pleasant things parliamentary adventure must undergo unpleasant 
doubt could refused listened tempter could go back though mr ruddles hardly encouraging mr molescroft 
browborough work last three days said mr ruddles tone reproach 
mr ruddles always thought amount work could heavy candidates 
make much difference asked mr molescroft 
well 
course among colliers ought 
came told said phineas 
telegraphed known 
help spilt milk 
must get work 
suppose disestablishing church particularly said phineas felt roman catholic delicate subject 
go need said mr molescroft though liberal good churchman 
mr ruddles dissenter strong opinion mr ruddles expressed necessity new candidate take church question spring religious convictions 
present duty called upon liberal candidate possible returned borough connected disseminate doctrines sect 
nevertheless opinion strong 
think must mr molescroft said sure must 
browborough taken side 
went church last sunday mayor two aldermen told said responses louder anybody else 
dined vicar trinity monday 
loud denouncing mr finn roman catholic declared everything state tankerville returns friend supporter pope 
find church cry election 
get anything supporting may make strong party pledging disendowment 
local taxation asked mr molescroft indeed preferred almost reform disendowment 
made mind must check municipal expenditure said phineas 
alone 
understand borough feeling election altogether church 
see mr finn roman catholic gives handle already beginning use 
like roman catholics manage give sort liberal turn many constituents used know though disliked church state rather cared pope may might act side rather 
mr molescroft understands 
oh yes understand 
mr ruddles said great deal effect though mr molescroft express acquiescence views neither dissent 
candidate said little interview turned matter mind 
seat parliament would barren honor could afford offer services barren honor 
honest political work anxious work desired paid 
party belonged knew endeavored avoid subject disendowment church england 
necessary nature political party country avoid long avoided consideration question involves great change 
consciousness minds leading politicians pressure behind forcing upon great measures drives almost quicker go becomes necessity resist rather aid pressure certainly last effective strength 
best carriage horses steadily hold back coach trundles hill 
phineas knew opinion barrington erles ratlers party would thank ventilating measure however certain might coming might well postponed years

acknowledged men finer speech delivered ever heard within walls house 
acknowledged also regarded question oratory mr daubeny failed signally 
strategy minister said excellent whereas ex minister loudly condemned 
nothing prejudicial cause temper 
man declared unfit position note always shows temper

made matter worse retreating within shell whole saturday sunday monday morning 
lord cantrip three four times saw mr palliser chancellor exchequer mr ratler 
went amidst congregation liberals asked support 
told ratler wished gentlemen vote altogether accordance opinions came whispered certain circles resigned resigning would resign leadership party 
men said passions much destroyed feelings regret almost remorse 
ministers held cabinet council monday morning supposed afterwards also stormy 
two gentlemen certainly resigned seats government house met four clock rumors abroad others would suggested measure found really amount disestablishment 
rumors course worthy belief transactions cabinet necessity secret 
lord drummond war office mr boffin board trade however actually resign mr boffin explanations house heard debate resumed 
mr boffin certainly joined present ministry said view destroying church 
remark make sure house would appreciate course induced seat gangway 
house cheered loudly mr boffin hero ten minutes 
mr daubeny detracted something triumph overstrained perhaps ironic pathos deplored loss right honorable friend services 
right honorable gentleman never specially serviceable 
wonder world arose fact two gentlemen twenty thirty composed government give places occasion 
conservative government force agony ratlers day repeat inappropriate name conservatives yet ready abandon church bidding man mr daubeny ratler almost felt loved church 
two resignations whereas expected whole house would fall pieces possible earls marquis two dukes staunch old tory squires remain government pledged disestablish church honesty truth great party confined bosoms mr boffin lord drummond doubtless esaus would sell great birthright small mess pottage parsons country little squires rarely come london spoke exactly ratlers 
parishes country mr boffin canonised though date cabinet minister could well less known fame mr boffin 
would liberals would naturally rejoice disestablishment church members lower house always spoken ascendancy protestant episcopacy bitter acrimony exclusion success failure mr daubeny must depend party 
must always measures reform advocated conservative ministry 
always number untrained men ready take gift without looking giver 
expected relief hands greeks take comes greeks trojans 
would mr turnbull say debate mr monk mr turnbull people tribune day mr monk also tribune minister something less tribune 
men house regarded mr monk honestest patriotic politician day 
debate long stormy peculiarly memorable skill mr daubeny higher colleagues defended steps take 
thing done cause religion 
whole line defense indicated gentlemen moved seconded address 
active well supported church chief need prosperous intelligent people 
endowments confusion ideas nothing done inappropriate religion 
education would receive bulk left existing interests amply guaranteed 
would doubt said gentlemen ample funds support episcopal church would come wealthy members body church dear 
seemed conviction clergymen new order things would much better old 
connection state time clearly gone 
church church would increased power could appoint bishops wholly dissevered state patronage 
seemed almost matter surprise really good churchmen endured long shackled subservience state 
gentlemen pleaded cause well almost made appear episcopal ascendancy would restored england disseverance church state 
mr turnbull dissenter last upon legs ratlers knew game lost 
would lost far could lost majority house motion majority minority mr daubeny would maintained high office ejected 
mr turnbull began declaring like mr daubeny minister crown 
habit attaching specially minister crown 
experience taught doubt 
possible ministers crown period mr daubeny thought perhaps worst dangerous 
thing offered good rejected let come quarter would 
indeed might said good things obtained people really serviceable reforms gathered garnered home consequence squabbles ministers men wanted power either grasp retain offered bribes people 
taking bribes dishonesty willingly take bribe 
mr monk spoke also 
would said feel justified refusing address crown proposed ministers simply address founded proposition future reform expediency many years entertained doubt 
could allow said voted permanence church establishment must therefore support government 
ratler whispered words neighbor knew way run gresham insisted poor old mildmay taking cabinet 
whole thing gone dogs said bonteen 
fourth night house divided mr daubeny owner majority fifteen 
many liberal party expressed opinion battle lost want judgment evinced mr gresham 
certainly longer sturdy adherence chief necessary solidarity party 
perhaps leader house ever devoutly worshipped small number adherents mr gresham worship support power 
within three days following division ratlers put heads together resolved duke st bungay man could keep party together 
lead house asked bonteen 
ratler sighed instead answering 
things come pass mr gresham possible leader

chapter xiii got seat phineas returned london autumn session though carried near christmas make many members unhappy already fortnight 
mr daubeny played game consummate skill last 
brought bill stated intention early following session 
said course aware first would quite impossible carry measure proposed weeks possible sit convening parliament christmas holidays thought expedient proposition named house ventilated members sides might induced give studious attention subject measure must momentous proposed 
happened unforeseen division house pressed address proved majority house favor great reform object ambition complete 
aware assembled somewhat unusual inconvenient period year service country demanded certain money bills passed 
however rejoiced greatly earliest opportunity afforded explaining intentions government honor connected 
answer arose perfect torrent almost vituperative antagonism opposite side house 
right honourable gentleman dare say question ventilated country never broached followers till general election completed notorious country first hint given right honourable gentleman elected east barsetshire equally notorious election arranged marvellous proposition right honourable gentleman known even party till remained possibility expression condemnation hustings might right honourable could rule followers house carry even matter absolutely opposite cherished convictions 
certainly seemed succeeded present 
would one believe would carried country dared face country measure hands ventilation indeed dared ventilate proposition 
used short session order might keep clutch fastened power indifferent alike constitution party country 
harder words never spoken house uttered occasion 
minister successful 
supported address went home east barsetshire christmas perhaps little fear parsons around full conviction would least carry second reading bill 
london usually full busy year immediately christmas 
seemed though admitted liberal party generally sadness occasion ought rob season usual festivities 
could eat mince pies think twelfth night terribly wicked scheme progress keeping real majority cold injustice thing rankled deeply sense inferiority cleverness displayed mr daubeny player checkmated audacious combination two pawns knight remaining forces victorious adversary beaten man two castles queen upon board 
indeed worse adversary appropriated use castles queen unhappy vanquished one 
church reform legitimate property liberals yet used felt right keep background future great occasion great valuable piece ordnance 
safely could afford bide time 
said believed country ready great measure 
must come must tenderness mode producing 
parsons must respected great church england feeling people must considered affectionate regard 
even rabid dissenter would hardly wish see structure nearly divine attacked destroyed rude hands 
grave slow sober earnestness loving touches soft caressing manipulation let beautiful old church laid rest something exquisite lovely refined present rough manners world ideas church reform leading liberals day man without even majority back audacious cagliostro among statesmen destructive leader declared conservatives come forward without moment warning pretended would thing hand men knew done 
country begun perceive old establishment must fall knowing would liberal backbone great britain perceive enormity cagliostro wickedness rise bury beneath scorn ought feeling made real christmas impossible messrs ratler bonteen 
one thing incredible said mr ratler englishmen mean 
alluding conservatives shown intention supporting mr daubeny accused simply view power patronage without regard consistency welfare country 
mr ratler probably correctly read minds men accusing perceive done experience little among concerted action 
defend church duty also duty support party 
one could see way one duty whereas vague probably ultimately impossible 
proper throw incubus conjuror authority surely wise great bold man would get declare 
junto wise men party would settle deposed 
look wise bold men even junto party consist honest chivalrous enthusiastic men mainly men idle unable take upon shoulders responsibility real work 
leaders selected outside clever eager pushing men late hardly selected among 
used case italian powers entrusted cause mercenary foreign generals soldiers fortune carried good swords whither wanted old leaders ever ready fight would declare casus belli 
much meanness mr ratler supposed conservative ranks much unhappiness 
would better go home live family park year round hunt attend quarter sessions able declare morning evening clear conscience country going dogs mental working many conservative supported mr daubeny occasion 
instance lady laura phineas called upon duke st bungay soon return kindly received grace 
former days whigs instead liberals almost rule political life leading whigs uncles brothers law cousins 
pleasant gave great consistency party system gone vogue 
remain however traces among nobler born liberals day still good deal agreeable family connection 
way st bungay fitz howards related mildmays standishes man barrington erle sure cousin 
lady laura thus sent friend relation duke phineas government grace glad enough receive returning aspirant 
course something said first life earl dresden 
duke recollected occasion banishment shook head attempted look unhappy wretched condition mr kennedy reported 
essentially happy man shook gloom phineas spoke politics 
coming back us mr finn tell may perhaps get seat 
heartily glad useful 
remember cantrip almost cried told going leave 
rather put upon fancy 
perhaps something grace 
nothing return beyond barren honors 

long said duke long candidates office regard time 
mr daubeny safe session least 
doubt whether really attempt carry measure year 
bring forward late division must get second reading 
break gracefully committee declare importance interests concerned demands inquiry 
thing done one year 
asked phineas 
everybody asks answer seems plain get side much support get none 
something sickening dishonesty said phineas energetically 
country advantage know dishonest 
ought come deadlock legislation order parties might fight battle till one killed think man support measure believes destructive 
believe destructive 
belief theoretic even quite 
hardly romantic 
long acres dear retain belonging country gentleman never really believe country danger 
commerce 
long three per cents 
really mean four per cent may say long mean five per cent country rich though every one swear ruined 
glad time call conservative said phineas 
shows disinterested certainly would office 
good bye 
come see duchess comes town 
nothing better give us day two longroyston easter 
longroyston duke well known country seat whig hospitality dispensed lavish hand two centuries 
th january phineas traveled tankerville obedience summons served upon instance judge try petition browborough 
special somewhat unusual nature petition complainants sought oust sitting member also give seat late unsuccessful candidate 
scrutiny successful great number votes would deducted polled behalf unfortunate mr browborough leave majority opponent additional disagreeable obligation upon paying cost transaction would thus lose seat 
mr browborough doubt looked upon whole thing greatest disgust 
thought battle regarded till occasion come another battle 
spent money like gentleman hated mean ways 
one could ever say ever petitioned 
way looking 
shibboleth prospects england church people doubt made house less agreeable last short session usual stuck party voted mr daubeny address obligation vote inconveniently pressed upon presentation petition formally completed 
always stuck party 
pride life true consistent 
also summoned tankerville forced go although knew shibboleth would thrown teeth 
mr browborough spent two three uncomfortable days tankerville whereas phineas triumphant 
worse things store poor mr browborough repudiated shibboleth even lost seat 
mr ruddles acting wondrous energy succeeded knocking necessary votes succeeded also proving votes void reason gross bribery 
astonished phineas cool effrontery took credit purchased votes fallgate liberal side phineas wise remind hinted one time would well lay little money way 
one present moment clear ruddles necessity purity elections 
penny misspent finnites 
vote two score knocked grounds touch candidate agents 
one man personated vote appeared done instigation cunning browborough partisan 
another man wrongly described 
however amounted nothing 
phineas finn seated borough judge declared purpose recommending house commons issue commission reference expediency instituting prosecution 
mr browborough left town great disgust without various publicly expressed intimations opponents prosperity england depended church people 
phineas gloriously entertained liberals borough informed much done hoped would open pockets behalf charities town 
gentlemen said phineas one two leading liberals well know poor man 
leading liberals made wry faces phineas member borough 
moment decision announced phineas shaking time congratulatory friends hurried post office sent message lady laura standish dresden got seat 
almost ashamed telegraph boy looked gave words task could entrusted one else 
almost thought truth proudest happiest moment life 
would thoroughly enjoy triumph would receive great unselfish joy almost wished could taken message 
surely done would fit occasion another embrace 
member british house commons possession privilege never ceased sigh since moment lost 
drunkard gambler may weaned ways politician 
house one phineas finn necessarily state discontent 
worked way determined fears future harass 
would give heart soul work money lasted
