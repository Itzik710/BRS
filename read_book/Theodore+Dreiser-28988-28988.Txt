turned topic looked window realization one impulse tell proved unavailing dwelling mind 
shortly thought consoled idea would surely find courage long 
arrival new york next day raised important question lester mind stop 
new york large place much danger encountering people would know thought well take chances 
accordingly cabman drive one exclusive apartment hotels engaged suite rooms settled stay two three weeks 
atmosphere jennie plunged wonderful illuminating could scarcely believe world inhabited

chapter xxiv problem gerhardt family relationship comparatively settled kane betook cincinnati business duties 
heartily interested immense plant occupied two whole blocks outskirts city conduct development much problem pleasure either father brother 
liked feel vital part great growing industry 
saw freight cars going railroads labeled kane manufacturing company cincinnati chanced notice displays company products windows carriage sales companies different cities conscious warm glow satisfaction 
something factor institution stable distinguished honestly worth 
well kane entering upon new phase personal existence word jennie 
conscious rode toward home city entering relationship might involve disagreeable consequences 
little afraid father attitude brother robert 
robert cold conventional character excellent business man irreproachable public private life 
never overstepping strict boundaries legal righteousness neither warm hearted generous fact would turn trick could speciously best necessitously recommended conscience 
reasoned lester know could follow ramifications logic could combine hard business tactics moral rigidity somehow brother managed 
got scotch presbyterian conscience mixed asiatic perception main chance 
lester told somebody situation accurately measured 
nevertheless could rout brother positions defy public conscience 
line convention practically perhaps sophisticatedly 
two brothers outwardly friendly inwardly far apart 
robert liked lester well enough personally trust financial judgment temperamentally agree life affairs conducted 
lester secret contempt brother chill persistent chase almighty dollar 
robert sure lester easy going ways reprehensible bound create trouble sooner later 
business quarrel much much chance old gentleman still charge certain minor differences constantly cropping showed way wind blew 
lester building trade friendly relationship concessions personal contact favors 
robert pulling everything tight cutting cost production offering financial inducements would throttle competition 
old manufacturer always best pour oil troubled waters foresaw eventual clash 
one would get perhaps 
two boys could agree used say 
another thing disturbed lester father attitude subject marriage lester marriage specific 
archibald kane never ceased insist fact lester ought get married making big mistake putting 
children save louise safely married 
favorite son injury morally socially commercially sure 
world expects man position father argued time time

got thirsty led water 
old gentleman gave time sore point 
wanted son settle real man affairs 
fact situation might militate permanent arrangement jennie obvious even lester time 
thought course action carefully 
course would give jennie whatever possible consequences 
must cautious must take unnecessary risks 
could bring cincinnati scandal ever found could install nice home somewhere near city family would probably eventually suspect something 
could take along numerous business journeys first one new york successful 
would always turned question mind 
difficulty gave zest 
perhaps st louis pittsburg chicago would best 
went places frequently particularly chicago 
decided finally chicago could arrange 
could always make excuses run night ride 
yes chicago best 
size activity city made concealment easy 
two weeks stay cincinnati lester wrote jennie coming cleveland soon answered thought would right call see 
father told

looked father business organization offering real chance could get control saw way 
robert interests always way anything two brothers farther apart ever ideas aims 
lester thought twice entering line business allying another carriage company feel ha could conscientiously 
lester salary fifteen thousand year secretary treasurer company brother vice president five thousand outside investments 
lucky shrewd speculation robert aside principal yielded five thousand nothing 
robert hand unquestionably worth three four hundred thousand dollars addition future interest business brothers shrewdly suspected would divided somewhat favor 
robert lester would get fourth thought sisters sixth 
seemed natural kane senior take view seeing brothers actually control work 
still certainty 
old gentleman might anything nothing 
probabilities would fair liberal 
time robert obviously beating lester game life 
lester intend comes time every thinking man life pauses takes stock condition asks fares individuality whole mental moral physical material 
time comes first heedless flights youth passed initiative powerful efforts made begins feel uncertainty results final values attaches everything 
deadening thought uselessness creeps many men minds thought best expressed preacher ecclesiastes 
yet lester strove philosophical 
difference make used say whether live white house home grand pacific question implication achievements life failed realize career 
white house represented rise success great public character 
home grand pacific come without effort 
decided time period death jennie mother would make effort rehabilitate 
would cut idling numerous trips jennie cost considerable time 
would make outside investments 
brother could find avenues financial profit could 
would endeavor assert authority would try make importance business rather let robert gradually absorb everything 
forsake jennie thought also came 
claim 
could make protest 
somehow see could done 
seemed cruel useless though disliked admit would uncomfortable 
liked loved perhaps selfish way 
see could desert well 
time really serious difference robert 
brother wanted sever relations old well established paint company new york manufactured paints especially house invest new concern chicago growing promising future 
lester knowing members eastern firm reliability long friendly relations house opposition 
father first seemed agree lester 
robert argued question cold logical way blue eyes fixed uncompromisingly upon brother face 
go forever said standing old friends father dealt like 
must change 
business must stiffened going stronger competition 
father feels said lester last 
deep feeling matter 
hurt one way 
say house going profit eventually 
stated arguments side 
inclined think robert right said archibald kane calmly 
things suggested far worked 
lester colored 
well discussion said 
rose strolled office 
shock defeat coming time considering pulling together depressed lester considerably 
much straw father remark brother business acumen even irritating 
beginning wonder whether father would discriminate way distribution property 
heard anything entanglement jennie resented long vacations taken business appear lester could justly chargeable either incapacity indifference far company concerned 
done work well 
still investigator propositions put house student contracts trusted adviser father mother worsted 
would end thought could reach conclusion 
later year robert came forward plan reorganization executive department business 
proposed build immense exhibition storage warehouse michigan avenue chicago transfer portion completed stock 
chicago central cincinnati 
buyers west country merchants could easily reached dealt 
would big advertisement house magnificent evidence standing prosperity 
kane senior lester immediately approved 
saw advantages 
robert suggested lester undertake construction new buildings 
would probably advisable reside chicago part time 
idea appealed lester even though took away cincinnati largely entirely 
dignified unrepresentative standing company 
could live chicago could jennie 
scheme taking apartment could arranged without difficulty 
voted yes 
robert smiled 
sure get good results around said 
construction work soon begin lester decided move chicago immediately 
sent word jennie meet together selected apartment north side comfortable suite rooms side street near lake fitted suit taste 
figured living chicago could pose bachelor 
would never need invite friends rooms
