yes great day botallack dwell long memories witnessed especially fortunate captain mine honor conducting princess occasion whose enthusiasm recalling event commenting intelligence condescension speak personal observation 
reader say story nothing admit frankly nothing whatever direct way nevertheless indirectly narrative may possibly arouse greater interest mine conduct route taken prince princess boscawen shaft exist period tale one much difficult dangerous shall see 
go however permit us add offence digression wandering still direct road 
facts regarding botallack mining operations without knowledge apt times misunderstand position 
let us suppose mine already opened lode vein quartz metal discovered cropping earth dug upon dug upon sea cliffs 
shaft sunk words hole excavated let us say two three hundred yards inland depth forty fifty fathoms near sea level 
shaft perhaps nine feet six wide 
lode layer quartz sometimes slopes one way sometimes another occasionally perpendicular 
also varies run direction little like wildish horse sometimes met lodes like bad companions divert straight course 
unlike bad companions however increase value point meeting thickening 
whatever course lode takes miner conscientiously follows suit 
shaft slopes much little according lie lode 
ancient truism water must find level 
owing law much water accumulates shaft obliging miner erect engine house provide powerful pumping engine gear immense cost keep works dry proceeds 
goes shore face perpendicular cliff little sea level cuts horizontal tunnel six feet high three broad continues chisel blast away solid rock drives tunnel quarter mile inland rate varying two six feet per week according hardness rock reaches shaft thus provides easy inexpensive passage water without pumping 
tunnel level calls adit level 
pumping engine means rendered useless much hauling ore surface etcetera 
process time miner works away lode sea level must sink shaft deeper perhaps ten twenty fathoms new levels driven horizontally lode water accumulates must pumped adit level whence escapes sea 
thus goes sinking shaft driving levels always following lode ad infinitum 
course must stop reaching side world present time botallack progressed direction depth fathoms 
find difficulty realizing depth really would observe equal three half times height st paul cathedral london nearly four times height st rollox chimney glasgow considerably twice height plain arthur seat near edinburgh 
levels driven considerable distance shaft air naturally becomes bad want circulation 
remedy evil holes short shafts called winzes sunk intervals upper lower levels 
winzes dangerous traps unwary careless extending frequently depth ten fifteen fathoms bridged across one two loose planks 
ladders fixed many facilitate progress mine 
miner drives end level far air circulate new winze usually sunk level 
circulation thus extended levels progress right left occupy miles ground 
levels shafts botallack put together would extend less forty miles superficial space ground beneath mine lies acres 
lode rich extends upwards downwards cut away levels regular systematic manner strong beams placed support temporary platforms miners may stand work ascend 
cut lode away level false timber bottom made replace rocky bottom level removed 
thus traversing old workings mine one suddenly comes great caverns narrow immense height depth rays candle penetrate darkness 
places thick short beams used old miners seen extending side side empty space disappearing dim perspective 
woe betide man stumbles narrow plank sets foot insecure beam places workings progress positions miners appear singularly wild insecure 
men stand narrow chasm granite walls others heads slight temporary platforms alone preserving certain death candles highest twinkling like stars black sky 
underground regions botallack three hundred men boys employed work occasionally night well day

mines great mining centres cornwall redruth st st austell helston well worthy note little deeper richer botallack

bony man powerful man also tall straight little beyond forty 
appearance hero romance mind seemed filled romantic thoughts smiled frequently gazed around top cliffs beautiful landscape lay spread feet 
wild undulating slopes covered rich green gorse cliffs gurnard cove rocky projections resemble castellated work man hand intermingled therewith much materiel connected pilchard fishery masses masonry heavy picturesque resemble nature handiwork 
beyond lay blue waters atlantic time calm almost mill pond studded hundred sails glittering sunshine 
spot appeared beautiful solitude living thing visible save romantic gentleman seagulls sheep 
pilchard fishery yet commenced three four fishermen pitched repaired boats one little spot sand could seen far rugged coast appeared like mice far distant break feeling solitude feeling little enhanced appearance spot far distant ruined engine house deserted mine 
indeed lovely afternoon beautiful scene misanthrope would gazed approach least benignity 
wonder george augustus clearemout smiled joyously whisked walking cane vigorously exuberance delight 
strange say smile always brightest cane flourished energetically turned eyes ruined mine even laughed twice muttered looked picturesque object yet seemed nothing appearance calculated produce laughter 
contrary alive sight might reduced tears brief existence raised uncommonly little tin copper although succeeded sinking immense amount gold nevertheless mr clearemout chuckled every time looked ruin appeared much tickled thoughts gave rise 
yes thing capital muttered turning object admiration better ha ha suitable yes em probably em em repeated phrase two three times greater display white teeth utterance superb name wheal em ha ha spell two make look natural ensure correct pronunciation wheal dooem nothing could finer quite candid board one call swindle 
last idea caused mr clearemout break loudest laugh hitherto indulged repeat appearance phaeton turn carriage road reduced gravity

rest party said mr grenfell turning mr clearemout friends st 
carriage stopped spoke number ladies gentlemen descended therefrom mingled congratulations narrow escape made thanks dark stranger orders questions counter orders explanations innumerable baskets carried places selected 
picnic need scarcely say much resembled picnics general 
good spirits elated splendor day beauty views freshness sea breeze sprang soon arrival 
one whose feelings absolutely unruffled oliver trembath 
youth afflicted unaccountable dislike dark stranger rendered somewhat uncomfortable 
stranger made extremely agreeable told anecdotes sang songs became immaculate waiter whole company handing plates glasses knives etcetera etcetera deftly dealing pack cards 
good listener heard people stories end commented one interested 
particularly attentive rose ellis guarded one noticed attentions peculiar except rose oliver trembath first time life great surprise displeasure felt demon jealousy tormenting breast 
midst mr george augustus clearemout displayed insatiable curiosity regard mines miners 
whatever might subject conversation time invariably took first opportunity returning favorite theme one another party occasion served 
ashamed feelings troubled oliver trembath resolved take bold manly step stifling making agreeable object dislike 
accordingly availed opportunity party broke groups saunter cliffs entered converse stranger subject mines 
appear take much interest mining think said walked promontory together 
indeed replied clearemout mines cornwall ever subject deep interest miners regard race men singularly endowed courage perseverance 
opinion correct said oliver 
ever seen work arrived county hope visit mines ere long 
said oliver enthusiasm opinion strengthened endurance underground perseverance species labor taxes muscular power well patience uttermost surpasses anything either seen heard 
england fully appreciate minutely acquainted endurance courage cornish miners 
rocks cut hard unyielding men trained childhood subdue would lose heart altogether weight toil small return 
sometimes indeed miners fortunate elsewhere lucky hits made part gains barely sufficient wants whether lucky unlucky respect toil always hard hard retain health strength sufficient go underground beyond age forty five hundreds find early grave owing disease resulting peculiar work accidents 
last usually occasioned bursting collections water flood mines fall masses timber premature explosion blast holes 
times men lose hold ladders fall away express stumble winze small shaft connecting level level latter case death almost certain ensue many winzes sixty feet deep 
st see many poor fellows blinded maimed mines 
nevertheless cornish miners contented uncomplaining race men cornwall justly proud 
much interested tell said clearemout fact come purpose making inquiry mines mining concerns 
find place said oliver 
uncle mr donnithorne mr grenfell mr cornish intimately acquainted mining phases certain happy give information power 
people st neighborhood find agreeable hospitable 
speak personal experience although short time among 
doubt replied mr clearemout bland smile limited experience goes far corroborate say hope pleasure still testing truth observations 
mr george augustus clearemout test truth several weeks picnic 
received kindness hospitality everywhere taken mines obliging agents invited several periodical business dinners called account dinners met shareholders mines opportunity conversing men note wealth various parts county 
dwelt stay old mr donnithorne much surprise pleasure rose proved proficient guitar good musician 
length dark gentleman took departure london whither shall follow watch proceedings short time returning principal scene tale 
almost immediately arrival great city betook west end fashionable square solicited interview old lady whose principal noteworthy points much gold much brains 
confiding old lady previous occasion quite insinuating address charming mr clearemout introduced noble lord 
confiding old lady george augustus painted cornish mines mining glowing colors recommended invest mine portion surplus funds 
confiding old lady taste speculation rather partial three per cent consols george augustus charmingly persuasive could help giving george proposed little plans opened little prospects confiding old lady agreed little plans without paying much regard little prospects 
mr clearemout paid another visit another west end square time gentleman 
gentleman young noble clearemout styled lord 
strange say also confiding nature much indeed appeared even completely influence george augustus confiding old lady 
benefit young gentleman mr clearemout painted picture glowing colors colors seemed grow warmer sun success rose upon 
added something value name referred money matter small consequence comparison 
young lord like old lady agreed everything proposed except proposal advance money 
point resolute clearemout care much obtaining money confiding young gentleman 
name good gold would enable screw money others 
dark man paid visit several friends west end less confiding selfish others unselfish dispositions without exception little weak intellectually 
glowing pictures cornish mine laid swallowed bait whole one two content nibble 
afternoon began merge evening mr clearemout paid last visit day west end rather nearer city gentleman somewhat like though less prepossessing whose benefit painted glowing picture mine said come jack made pretty good job let go chop 
luck equalled mine thing done wheal dooem named sweet little thing going full swing couple weeks costing perhaps hundreds put working order trifle thereafter shape wages man boy coal fire keep thing moving much noise possible make show leaving pretty little balance twenty thirty thousand credit company enjoy meantime minus small sum rent office clerk salary gas coal etcetera long bubble lasts 
thus polite scoundrel go house house getting cornish mining company false pretences polite scoundrels done doubtless others bringing unmerited disrepute genuine grand old mines cornwall yielded stores tin copper enriching english nation ever since old world days phoenicians sailed adventurous barks cassiterides quest tin

one miner named john nicols driving end extending level lengthwise two others stopeing cutting roof pursuit promising little lode 
using hammer pick soft ground water trickled 
well known approaching old part mine worked thirty years 
drainage ground however accurately known therefore questions put experienced miners probable condition untapped land

anxious see place nature danger threatened descended along 
captain time put question men still picking cautiously soft ground flow water suddenly increased 
recognising probable danger lad named oats called father end level nicols 
moment water forced gap wall three feet long half foot wide burst upon terrific violence 
turned fled 
oats son captain nicols made nearest shaft eighty yards distant escaped brothers batten oliver thrown swept away 
one desperate effort made oliver outstrip rushing stream candles blown stooping sufficiently low dashed head overhanging rock fell 
retained sufficient consciousness however aware desperate struggle life must made without knowing aimed fought strength giant thick darkness chaotic flood strength soon gave way seconds became insensible 
terrible catastrophe occurred known men mine roar rushing water

various depths level levels cut also running various directions several miles extent 
successive levels connected communicated main shafts mine winzes smaller shafts connected level level many places 
used ladder ways others cut merely purpose securing ventilation 
many parts lower levels miners work following course promising lodes stopeing cutting overhead cutting downwards driving ends extending levels others sinking winzes keep ventilation pushed shafts throats flowed life giving air 
men dreaded sounds reached profounder depths muffled deep toned roar distant storm well understood well heard pent waters irresistible fury carried pent atmosphere sent low narrow levels circling tubes monster trumpet mingled crash hurling timbers rocks debris created mighty roar excelled hideous grandeur prolonged peals loud thunder 
every man dropped tools ran nearest shaft life 
indeed probable flood would fill wide extended ramifications vast mine one knew certain catastrophe occurred near danger might spot labored
