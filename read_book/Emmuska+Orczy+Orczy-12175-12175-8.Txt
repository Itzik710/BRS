chapter xxxix home coming adam lambert heads bent none ignorant folk stood around would dared even look old woman kneeling beside rough deal box contained body lad 
reverent feeling killed curiosity bewilderment extraordinary wholly unexpected turn events merged sense respectful awe rendered every mouth silent lowered every lid 
squire boatfield almost paralyzed astonishment murmured half stupidly adam lambert dead understand 
turned marmaduke de chavasse vaguely instinctively expecting answer terrible puzzle 
de chavasse feet seemed control truth led forward stood far old woman 
watched silent rigid conscious one thing trivial matter certes editha inquiring eyes fixed steadily upon 
everything else merged kind dream 
mute question eyes concerned 
seemed represent satisfaction morbid curiosity terrible obsession past nerve racking days 
editha realizing identity dead man would know entire truth 
editha fate closely linked render knowledge truth dangerous de chavasse therefore merely sense profound satisfaction someone would henceforth share secret 
quite impossible analyze thoughts man thus stood silent almost impassive spectator scene wherein fate life awful retribution deadly justice hanging balance 
mad act either irrelevance rashness 
sense self protection still keen violently keen although undoubtedly alone responsible events culminated present crisis 
whole aspect affairs changed moment real identity dead established 
everyone present would regard new mystery altogether different light viewed former weird problem still need danger murderer 
editha would know course one else would vastly curious anon see lady sue would

rain momentarily ceased although gale promising havoc still continued mournful swaying dead branches trees 
gentle drip drip replaced incessant patter 
humid atmosphere long ago penetrated rough shirts worsted breeches causing spectators weird tragedy shiver cold 
shades evening begun gather 
useless attempt reach minster nightfall presumably would old quakeress thus parted dead body lad 
richard lambert begged coffin might taken cottage

sir marmaduke sneering taunt one spoken 
yokels womenfolk matter passed altogether beyond ken 
bewildered understanding half fearful consulted one another vaguely mutely eyes quaint expressive gestures wondering best done 
twas fortunate rain ceased 
one one women still holding kirtles tightly round shoulders began move away 
deal box seemed reached degree mystery twas best keep distance

prepared carry coffin minster last hang back 
squire boatfield obviously giving directions foreman mat tugged forelock intervals indicating prepared obey 
others stood aside waiting instructions 
thus deal box remained ground exactly opposite tiny wooden gate strangely isolated neglected looking dispersal interested crowd surrounded awhile ago

adam lambert lying dead obviously murdered clothes affected de chavasse masquerading french hero could one conclusion 
editha throughout given helping hand management monstrous comedy awful solution puzzle could recoil strive deny one sane thought left madly whirling brain 
though fought conclusion might succeed driving thoughts vein uncertainty slender thread hope might prey awful delusion word someone really knew would anon easily dissipate 
someone really knew nay someone could marmaduke dared ask questions 
mayhap hand old woman richard lambert knew cared say 
sue indeed deeply absorbed thoughts walking head bent eyes fixed ground like somnambulist 
editha moved unreasoning instinct determined see quakeress also man lay dead hoping mayhap might glean real solution mystery sooner later would undoubtedly drive mad 
running rapidly past horse rider would speak marmaduke reached cottage soon enough

shuffled across old oak dresser occupied one wall little room 
two pairs glowing eyes followed every movement richard lambert seemed see vision destiny faintly outlined still blurred slowly unfolding tangled web fate editha even old woman spoke felt tidal wave long forgotten memories sweeping right senses 
look quakeress eyes words uttered though still obscure enigmatical already told whole truth 
flash saw youth follies gay life thoughtlessness pleasures cradles children tiny boys woman fashion hindrance burden 
saw mother rigid dour counterpart old puritan hesitated part two children mother score years hesitated fling insult upon insult wretched woman paid debt careless frivolity long ago 
thy brother name henry adam de chavasse thine michael richard de chavasse sons rowland de chavasse wanton wife 
old woman taken packet papers yellow age stained many tears secret drawer old oak dresser 
voice longer tremulous wont firm dull monotonous tone like one speaks whilst trance 
squire boatfield uttered exclamation boundless astonishment 
mechanically took packet papers quakeress hand instant hesitation response appealing look richard broke string held documents together perused one one 
editha even last old woman words ceased echo narrow room risen feet 
heavy cloak glided shoulders upon ground eyes preternaturally large glowing full awe fixed upon young man son 
de chavasse murmured brain whirling heart filled awful terror also great overwhelming joy 
sons peremptory gesture quakeress stopped word mouth 
nay said loudly pollute sacred name letting pass thy lips 
women thou made motherhood thy mother knew took thy children thee cursed thee death bed thy sins thy shame thy sons honest god fearing men tis thanks thee 
thou alone hast heaped shame upon dead father name hast contrived wreak ruin sons knew thee 
quakeress paused moment pale opaque eyes lighted inward glow wrath satisfied vengeance

together rejoiced woman subsequent humiliation sorrow longing children ceaseless search ever recurrent disappointments 
quakeress hour come whole dour sect taken upon punish avenge 
editha shamed miserable even daring approach son beg affection look stood quite rigid pale allowing torrent old woman pent hatred fall upon crush rough cruelty 
squire boatfield would interposed 
glanced various documents proofs old woman asserted satisfied horrible tale seemed unparalleled cruelty indeed true narrow bigotry community succeeded performing monstrous crime parting wretched woman twenty years sons 
vaguely mind kindly squire hoped magistrate could fitly punish crime child stealing expression regarded old quakeress certainly one good 
mistress lambert meanwhile approached editha 
took younger woman hand dragged towards coffin 
lies one thy sons said relentless energy eldest thy pride murdered dark spot skulking criminal curse thee curse thee say thy mother cursed thee death bed curse thee retribution come last words died away mournful echo whitewashed walls 
moment stood wrathful defiant upright stern like justiciary dead son miserable woman truth suffering almost unendurable agony mind heart 
midst awesome silence followed loudly spoken curse sound firm footstep rough deal floor next moment michael richard de chavasse kneeling beside mother covering icy cold hand kisses 
heart broken moan escaped throat 
stooped trembling lips gently touched young head bent simple love uninquiring reverence 
without word without look cast either cruel enemy silent spectator terrible drama turned ran rapidly room dark dismal night 
deep sigh content mistress lambert fell knees thence upon floor 
old heart contained much love much hatred stern self sacrifice deadly revenge ceased beat worker work done 
chapter xlii return master courage toogood long ago given thought waiting mistress 
knocked repeatedly door cottage behind thick panels heard loud thought angry voices speaking words could however quite understand 
answer come knocking tired excitement day fearful thought lonely walk awaited chose believe mayhap either misunderstood master orders sir marmaduke mistaken thought mistress back cottage 
surmises vastly master courage toogood liking whose name somewhat belied timid personality 
swinging lantern striving keep spirits aid lusty song resolutely turned steps towards home 
whole landscape seemed filled eeriness events day left impress dark november night causing sighs gale seem spectral weird usual dim outline trees branches turned away coastline seem like unhappy spirits thin gaunt arms stretched dejectedly toward unresponsive distance 
master toogood tried think ghosts many stories pixies goblins said take malicious pleasure timorousness mankind truth nearly uttered cry terror would fallen knees mud dark object quite undistinguishable gloom suddenly loomed 
yet portly figure master pyot petty constable seemed mounting guard outside cottage vastly amused toogood pusillanimity 
entered converse young man doubt feeling somewhat lonely midst darkness peopled unseen shadows 
master courage ready enough talk 
acquired master busy eloquence subject secret investigations mystery gained intensity afternoon revelations old quakeress engrossing one 
attention pyot vouchsafed narration greatly enhanced master toogood delight therein especially petty constable instinctively measured steps younger man accompanying way towards court 
courage told attentive listener master busy surmises determination probe secrets mysterious crime quite truthful worthy butler hard toes scented long ere committed seeing used spend long hours vast discomfort forked branches old elms surrounded pavilion boundary park 
toogood notion master busy ever discovered anything interest neighborhood pavilion quite quite sure saintly man never dared venture inside archaic building reputation haunted still gratified perceive petty constable vastly interested tale spite obvious defects completeness moreover master pyot showed signs turning heel continued trudge along gloomy road company sir marmaduke youngest serving man 
thus editha ran mistress lambert cottage ears ringing fanatic curses heart breaking joy reverent filial kiss imprinted upon hands found road precincts cottage entirely deserted 
night pitch dark rain 
great heavy clouds still hung icy blast caught skirts lifted latch gate turned open 
cared little inclemency weather 
knew way well enough mind full terrible thoughts real yield subtle feeble fears engendered imaginings supernatural 
nay would mayhap welcomed pixies goblins mischievous pranks claimed attention 
would truth diverted mind contemplation awful monstrous deed accomplished man would meet anon 
villagers called adam lambert son henry adam de chavasse sir marmaduke murderer child 
curses old quakeress vengefully poured upon nothing compared awful terrible fact 
son murdered eldest son never known involuntarily mayhap compulsorily certes measure helped bring events culminated appalling crime

wonder sighed ghouls shadowy monsters well nigh longing sight distorted faces ugly deformed bodies loathsome shapes far less hideous specter inhuman homicide followed along dark road ran ran ran towards home dwelt living monster evil man done deed helped accomplish 
complete darkness reigned around could see yard road front went blindly guided instinct led unseen shadow driving 
round gale moaning creaking branches trees branches like arms stretched forth appeal towards unattainable 
progress slow walking teeth hurricane shoes ever anon remained glued slimy mud 
road straight enough knew well felt neither fatigue discomfort 
sue think 
wrongs done defenseless girl nothing compared irreparable wrongs done sons living dead one foul dagger inhuman assassin shame disgrace 
sue young 
sue would soon forget 
girl wife would soon regain freedom mother soul taint murder child gate leading court road wide open left doubt sir marmaduke returned 
house dark light save one pierced interstices ill fitting shutters 
editha paused moment gate looking house great black mass blacker surrounding gloom 
home many years ever since youth sprightliness vanished nowhere go shelter 
home ever since richard youngest boy entered dependent 
oh immeasurable fool tricked fooled years man two days ago put crown upon infamy 
knew boys helped keep away mother filch present future inheritance 
loathed loathed allowed drag 
aye truth wronged worse even wronged brother sons fixed eyes steadily one light alone pierced inky blackness solid mass house 
came little withdrawing room left entrance hall place beyond one tiny light appeared quite silent deserted 
even stableyard right serving men quarters sound came mingle weird whisperings wind 
editha approached stooping ground groped mud hands encountered two three pebbles 
picked going close house threw pebbles one one half closed shutter withdrawing room 
next moment heard latch casement window lifted within anon rickety shutter flew back thin creaking sound like animal pain 
upper part sir marmaduke figure appeared window embrasure like dark massive silhouette yellowish light within 
stooped forward seeming peer darkness

stillness could hear open drawing room door cross hall finally unbolt heavy outer door 
pushed past threshold went gloomy hall pitch dark save flickering light candle held 
waited closed door stood quite still confronting allowing look face read expression eyes 
order raised candle hand trembling perceptibly feeble light quivered grasp illumining face fitful intervals creeping rigid shoulders arms far hands tightly clenched 
danced upon face lighting weird gleams fitful sparks showing wild look eyes glitter almost madness dilated pupils dark iris sharply outlined glassy orbs 
licked trembling lips distorted mouth drawn nostrils dank hair almost alive nameless fear 
would denounce murmured cry choked toneless could scarce rise dry parched throat 
yes said 
uttered violent curse 
devil time go said calmly tis long twixt dawn 
understood

wished evil desired sight 
tried say something flippant something cruel sneering stopped peremptory gesture 
go said might forget everything save killed son 
moment thought life danger hands awful baffled rage expression face understood indeed knew everything 
even moment longed cruel instincts prompt kill 
could never succeed hiding crime retributive justice would surety overtake without help 
doubt thought weird flicker candle light showed unflinching face next moment another muttered curse careless shrug shoulders turned heel slowly went upstairs candle hand 
editha watched massive figure merged gloom heavy oak stairway
