stood seraphims one six wings twain covered face twain covered feet twain fly 
one cried unto another said holy holy holy lord hosts whole earth full glory 
posts door moved voice cried house filled smoke 
said woe undone man unclean lips dwell midst people unclean lips mine eyes seen king lord hosts 
flew one seraphims unto living coal hand taken tongs altar laid upon mouth said lo hath touched thy lips thine iniquity taken away thy sin purged 
also heard voice lord saying shall send go us said send
