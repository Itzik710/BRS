philip providence preserved us certainly assist 
impossible perish among many islands many inhabited woman certain kind treatment

little reflection may induce think rather advantage otherwise thus separated many lawless companions whose united force could resist 
think lengthened sojourn island people us would permit remain quiet possession wife would respect laws amine opinion miraculously preserved shame ill treatment death 
durst surely well krantz must make raft follow must remain seek wide world 
wish philip follow fortunes replied krantz glad find something however wild idea mind feed 
let us return raft seek refreshment much require consider may best plan pursue 
philip much exhausted tacitly consented followed krantz raft beached 
men left sitting apart one another shade chosen cocoa nut tree 
articles saved raft landed krantz called upon come carry things shore one would answer obey 
sat watching money afraid leave lest dispossessed others 
lives comparatively speaking safe demon avarice taken full possession souls sat exhausted pining water longing sleep yet dared move fixed wand enchanter 
cursed dollars turned brains observed krantz philip let us try manage remove stand need search water 
philip krantz collected carpenter tools best arms ammunition possession latter would give advantage case necessity dragged shore sail small spars carried clump cocoa nut trees hundred yards beach

evening closed philip thrown spare sails fallen asleep krantz set explore island upon thrown 
small exceeding three miles length one part five hundred yards across 
water none unless obtained digging fortunately young cocoa nuts prevented absolute necessity

yes least shall meet 
providence thank thee 
krantz stepped ascertain condition men 
found faint exhausted could possibly survive much longer yet still watching darling treasure 
melancholy witness perversion intellect krantz thought plan might save lives 
proposed separately bury money deep recovered without time would prevent one attacking treasure without perceived attempt frustrated would enable obtain necessary food refreshment without danger robbed 
plan acceded 
krantz brought tent shovel possession one one buried dollars many feet deep yielding sand 
secured wealth brought one axes cocoa nut trees fell restored new life vigor 
satiated lay upon several spots buried dollars soon enjoying repose much needed 
philip krantz many serious consultations means taken quitting island going search amine although krantz thought latter part philip proposal useless venture say 
quit island necessary provided gained one inhabited could expect 
amine considered dead either washed raft body lying exposed decomposing heat torrid sun 
cheer philip expressed otherwise whenever talked leaving island save lives invariably search philip lost wife 
plan proposed acted upon construct light raft center composed three water casks sawed half row behind firmly fixed cross pieces two long spars side 
sail would move quickly water manageable enable steer course 
outside spars selected hauled shore work already progress left alone work seamen appeared idea present quitting island 
restored food repose content money anxious 
portion party wealth dug gambled day pebbles collected beach invented game 
another evil crept among cut steps largest cocoa nut trees activity seamen mounted tapping top trees fixing empty cocoa nuts underneath obtained liquor first fermentation termed toddy afterwards distilled arrack 
toddy quite sufficient intoxicate every day scenes violence intoxication accompanied oaths execrations became dreadful 
losers tore hair rushed like madmen upon gained dollars krantz fortunately thrown weapons sea saved well ammunition secreted 
blows bloodshed therefore continual loss life none contending parties separated others anxious play interrupted 
state affairs nearly fortnight work raft slowly proceeded 
men lost general consent wealth banished certain distance might pilfer 
walked gloomily round island beach seeking instrument might avenge obtain repossession money 
krantz philip proposed men join leave island sullenly refused 
axe never parted krantz 
cut cocoa nut trees required subsistence prevented men notching trees procure means inebriation 
sixteenth day money passed hands three men fortunate rest

large store cocoa nuts old young procured put board intention philip krantz quitted island next day 
unfortunately one men bathing perceived arms lying shallow water 
dived procured cutlass others followed example armed 
induced philip krantz sleep board raft keep watch night play going heavy loss one side ended general fray 
combat furious less excited intoxication 
result melancholy three left alive 
philip krantz watched issue every man fell wounded put sword three left fighting side rested panting weapons 
pause two communicated result attack upon third man fell dead beneath blows 
merciful father thy creatures exclaimed philip 
replied krantz worshipped devil mammon 
imagine two could divide wealth could well spend return country consent division never must yes 
krantz hardly expressed opinion one men taking advantage turning round moment passed sword back 
man fell groan sword passed body 
said treacherous villain shall reap reward continued krantz levelling musket held hand shooting dead 
done wrong krantz saved punishment deserved 
left alone island without means obtaining subsistence must perished miserably inches money round would torture indeed perhaps wrong 
may providence forgive could help 
let us go ashore island alone 
must collect treasure bury may recovered time take portion us knows may occasion 
morrow better remain shall enough burying bodies infatuated men wealth caused destruction 
philip agreed propriety suggestion next day buried bodies lay treasure collected deep trench cocoa nut tree carefully marked axe 
five hundred pieces gold selected taken board raft intention secreting persons resorting case need 
following morning hoisted sail quitted island 
need said direction steered may well imagined quarter last seen raft isolated amine 
chapter xxvii raft found answer well although progress water rapid obeyed helm command 
philip krantz careful taking marks observations island enable necessary find

object seeking amine find direction ternate king knew variance portuguese fort factory tidore far distant thence obtain passage one chinese junks way bantam called island 
towards evening neared large island soon ran close beach 
philip eyes wandered every direction ascertain whether anything shore indicated presence amine raft could perceive nothing kind see inhabitants

krantz steering long sweep fitted purpose observed philip time silent take breast relic wore gaze attentively upon 
picture philip observed krantz 
alas destiny replied philip answering without reflection 
destiny mean say destiny hardly know said replied philip replacing relic bosom 
rather think said intended replied krantz time something near truth 
often perceived trinket hand forgotten anxious schriften obtain consequences attempt upon 
secret mystery attached surely must sufficiently know friend feel worthy confidence 
friend krantz feel sincere much valued friend shared much danger together sufficient make us friends could trust believe feel dare trust anyone 
mystery attached relic relic yet confided wife holy men alone 
trusted holy men surely may trusted sincere friendship nothing holy 
presentiment knowledge secret would prove fatal 
feel presentiment know feel krantz afford lose valued friend 
make use friendship appears replied krantz 
risked life deterred duties friendship childish foreboding part result agitated mind weakened body 
anything absurd suppose secret confided pregnant danger unless indeed zeal assist may lead difficulties 
prying disposition long connected together isolated rest world appears would solace confide one trust evidently long preyed upon mind 
consolation advice friend philip despised feel relieved able talk subject evidently oppresses 
therefore value friendship let share sorrows 
passed life quietly recollect much grief assuaged confiding cause listening counsels consolations dear friend 
must therefore appear surprising situated oppressed loss amine philip regard krantz one might venture confide important secret 
commenced narrative injunctions felt krantz could respect secret secret sake good towards likely bound promise day raft passed various small capes headlands island poured krantz ear history reader acquainted

think credit strange tale imagine well would mere phantom disordered brain philip believe replied krantz ocular proof correctness part history 
remember often seen phantom ship father permitted range seas selected permitted reverse doom fully believe every word told since told comprehend much behavior times appeared unaccountable many would pity philip envy 
envy cried philip 
yes envy gladly would take burden doom shoulders possible 
splendid thought summoned great purpose instead roaming world pursuit wealth possibly may lose years cost hardship venture day events must leave behind us selected fulfil great glorious work work angels may say redeeming soul father suffering indeed human frailties doomed perish eternity indeed object pursuit worthy hardships dangers maritime life
