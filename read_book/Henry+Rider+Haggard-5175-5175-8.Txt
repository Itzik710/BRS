also sent messengers caleb said command jewish force joppa telling peril 
strong many principal jews tyre number hundred indeed flocked benoni palace fortress together wives children since place power town could easily defended 
lastly outer courts galleries stationed fifty faithful servants slaves understood use arms 
thus things remained syrians threatening gates windows high houses till one night miriam awakened dreadful sound screaming 
sprang bed instantly nehushta side 
happens gasped dressed hastily 
syrian dogs attack jews answered nehushta mainland lower city 
come roof whence see passes hand hand ran sea portico steep steps 
dawn breaking looking walled roof need light since everywhere dim city pal tyrus mainland houses flared like gigantic torches 
red glare could see thousands attackers dragging inmates death thrusting back flames night made horrible shouts maddened mob cries victims crackling roar burning houses 
oh christ mercy sobbed miriam

first attack made upon main gates found strong taken easily assailants retreated loss score men shot defenders wall 
tactics adopted syrians possessing neighbouring houses began gall garrison arrows windows 
thus drove cover little since palace marble cemented roofs could fired burning shafts sent upon 
first day passed night attack made upon 
dawn came learned reason opposite gates reared great battering ram moreover sea huge galley rowed close walls depth water would allow decks sailors might hurl stones siege arrows means catapults thus break defences destroy

thus matters went till noon besiegers galling arrows land side galley battering sea could little nothing return engines 
benoni called council set case desperate enough

take visit place 
ithiel led cistern cistern flight steps little vaulted chamber entered stone trap door made substance paving chamber closed none would guess passage beneath 
old store room doubtless ran steps ending appearance blank wall 
coming ithiel thrust piece flat iron foot length crack wall lifted stone latch within pushed whereon block masonry something height width man quite yard thickness swung outwards 
nehushta passed aperture followed ithiel 
see said loosing hold stone without noise instantly closed behind appeared nothing wall well hung come hither without iron would dangerous 
crack must set lift latch within 
whoever lived guarded food water well answered nehushta 
ithiel showed place 
massive tower square forty feet whereof doorway told bricked many years keep thieves vagabonds sheltering 
height must measured nearly hundred feet roof long ago rotted away 
staircase stone still remained however leading four galleries also stone 
perhaps floors well vanished stone galleries balustrades remaining 
ithiel led nehushta stair though narrow safe easy 
resting story length came gallery projected sides within ten feet top tower saw jerusalem country round spread like map beneath 
sunset returned

miriam waited though would eat nothing till length ithiel came led past cistern stairs store treasure chamber trap door stood wide since except case danger need shut 
next reached door solid stone ithiel showed open entered base massive building 
far miriam saw sky red lights morning sight clapped hands called aloud 
hush said ithiel 
walls thick yet safe raise voice joy jerusalem home thousand miseries lest perchance hear cleft masonry cause search made singer 
follow 
went till last reached topmost gallery wall pierced loopholes overhanging platforms whence stones missiles could hurled upon attacking force 
miriam looked eagerly walking round gallery aperture aperture 
south lay marble courts glittering buildings temple whence although men fought daily smoke sacrifice still curled heaven 
behind upper lower city crowded thousands houses packed every one human beings fled hither refuge notwithstanding dangers time celebrate passover 
east rugged valley jehoshaphat beyond mount olives green trees soon laid low romans 
north new city bezetha bordered third wall rocky lands beyond 
far away also somewhat front left rose mighty tower antonia one strongholds john gischala zealots also west across width city towers hippicus phas l mariamne backed splendid palace herod 
besides walls fortresses gates palaces without number intricate many eye could scarcely follow count numberless narrow streets jerusalem 
many things ithiel pointed miriam listened eagerly till wearied task 
looked downwards overhanging platforms stone large market place beneath front upon roofs houses mostly humbler sort built behind almost walls old tower whereon many people gathered though safety eating morning meal talking anxiously together even praying 
whilst thus engaged nehushta touched miriam pointed road ran valley thorns northeast 
looked saw great cloud dust advanced swiftly presently dust sheen spears armor 
romans said nehushta quietly 
one caught sight suddenly battlement every wall tower roof every lofty house upper courts temple high places became crowded thousands tens thousands heads staring towards advancing dust 
silence stared though multitudes stricken dumb till presently far maze winding streets floated wail single voice 
woe woe jerusalem said voice 
woe woe city temple shuddered seemed listening thousands within reach mournful cry shuddered also 
aye repeated ithiel woe jerusalem yonder comes doom 
rocky ground dust grew thinner could distinguish divisions mighty army destroyers 
first came thousands syrian allies clouds scouts archers searched country far wide 
next appeared road makers camp setters beasts burden general baggage great escort followed titus bodyguard officers pikemen horsemen 
seen strange terrible looking engines war beyond count tribunes captains cohorts guards preceded engines abomination desolation roman eagles surrounded bands trumpeters time time uttered loud defiant note 
marched vast army ranks six deep divided legions followed camp bearers squadrons horse 
lastly seen packs baggage mercenaries thousands tens thousands 
hill saul great host halted began encamp 
hour later band horsemen five six hundred strong emerged camp marched along straight road jerusalem 
titus said ithiel 
see imperial standard goes 
came till lofty perch miriam keen sighted could see separate armor tell color horses 
eagerly searched eyes well guessed marcus would one accompanied general upon service 
plumed warrior might purple cloak galloped near standard errand 
sure yet far apart great sea rolled 
reconnoitred passing tower women sudden gate opened alleys houses lain ambush poured thousands jews 
right thin line horsemen pierced uttering savage cries doubled back upon severed ends 
many cut miriam could see falling horses 
imperial standard sank rose sank rise 
dust hid combat thought romans must slain 
presently began appear beyond dust riding back way come though fewer 
charged multitude jews escaped 
escaped left behind ah could tell sick anxious heart miriam descended steps tower darkness caves 
chapter xv passed tower nearly four months gone 
perhaps whole history world never never cruel suffering endured inhabitants jerusalem period rather survivors nation jews crowded together within walls 
forgetting internecine quarrels face overwhelming danger late factions united fought common foe ferocity seldom equalled 
left nothing undone desperate men could 
sallied forth romans slaughtering thousands 
captured battering rams catapults 
undermined great wooden towers titus erected walls burnt 
varying success made sally upon sally 
titus took third wall new city bezetha

sent josephus historian persuade jews surrender countrymen cursed stoned war went 
length seemed impossible carry place assault titus adopted surer terrible plan 
enclosing first unconquered wall temple fortress another wall making sat waited starvation work 
came famine 
beginning maddened devil inspired factions began destroy prey upon peaceful people jerusalem amply provisioned 
party squandered stores within reach whenever could burnt rivals food might supplied whole city months vanished quickly orgies wanton waste destruction 
almost gone tens hundreds thousands people starved 
curious matters desire know much human beings endure savagery capable hunger drives may find details set pages josephus renegade jewish historian 
serves good purpose help story repeat indeed part terrible repeated 
history record mind man invent cruelty practiced famished jews upon jews suspected crime hidden food feed families 
fearful prophecy fulfilled came mothers devoured infants children snatched last morsel bread lips dying parents 
things done one blood dreadful torment practiced stranger upon stranger city went mad beneath weight abominable obscene misery 
thousands perished every day every night thousands escaped attempted escape romans caught poor wretches crucified beneath walls till wood make crosses ground whereon stand 
things many others miriam saw place outlook gallery deserted tower 
saw people lying dead hundreds streets beneath 
saw robbers hale houses torture discover hiding place food supposed hidden failed put sword 
saw valley kidron lower slopes mount olives covered captive jews writhing crosses die messiah rejected died 
saw furious attacks yet furious sallies dreadful daily slaughter till length heart grew sick within although still took refuge ruined tower escape gloom beneath miriam would spend whole hours lying face fingers thrust ears might shut sights sounds unutterable woe 
meanwhile essenes still stores food ventured forth rarely lest good condition bodies although faces white death dwelling darkness tempt starving hordes seize torture hope discovering hiding places nutriment 
indeed several brethren happened obedience oaths seen instance past president theophilus went heard endured died without murmur betrayed nothing 
still notwithstanding danger driven utter weariness confinement dark desire obtaining news time time one would creep forth night return daybreak 
men miriam heard murder high priest mathias sons together sixteen sanhedrim charge correspondence romans grandfather benoni elected body exercised much influence caused many put death accused treason favoring roman cause 
caleb also temple foremost every fight 
said sworn oath would slay prefect horse marcus ancient quarrel slain 
told indeed met already struck blows separated accident war 
beginning august came length wretched city addition miseries panted heat scorching summer sun poisoned stench dead bodies filled streets hurled thousands walls 
romans set battering engines gates temple slowly surely winning way outer courts 
certain night hour dawn miriam woke nehushta telling stifling vaults must ascend tower 
nehushta said folly whereon miriam answered would go alone 
would suffer together passed stairs according custom gained base tower swinging door stone climbed steps ran thickness wall till reached topmost gallery 
sat fanned faint night wind watched fires romans stretched far wide around walls even among ruins houses almost beneath since part city taken 
presently dawn broke splendid fearful dawn 
though angel daybreak dipped wing sea blood dashed brow night still crowned fading stars 
sudden heavens filled blots threads flaming color latticed pale background twilight sky 
miriam watched kind rapture letting glory peace sink troubled soul arose sound awakening camps making ready daily battle 
soon ray burning light cast like spear crest mount olives across valley jehoshaphat struck full upon gold roofed temple courts 
coming though signal northern gates thrown wide poured flood gaunt savage warriors 
came thousands uttering fierce war cries 
pickets romans tried stay rush minute overcome destroyed 
surging round feet great wooden tower filled archers 
fight desperate soldiers titus rushed companies defend engine 
could drive back onset presently tower fire last mad effort save lives defenders casting headlong lofty platform 
shouts triumph jews rushed breaches second wall leaving remained castle antonia left poured maze streets ruined houses lay immediately behind old tower whence miriam watched 
front building romans never attempted enter since military purposes useless lay open space doubt part garden late years used cattle market place young men exercised arms 
bordering waste side strong fortifications camping ground twelfth fifteenth legions 
across open space remained romans fled back towards outer line followed swarms furious jews 
gained overtaken jews pursued met fierce charge delivered fresh troops behind defences turn swept back took refuge among ruined houses 
suddenly miriam attention became concentrated upon mounted officer led charge gallant looking man clad splendid armor whose clear ringing voice uttered words command caught ear even tumult shouting 
roman onslaught reached limit began fall back like water exhausted wave upon slope sand 
moment jews condition press enemy retreat mounted officer withdrew last time turn horse heedless arrows sang study ground strewn wounded dead 
presently looked deserted tower though wondering whether could make use miriam saw face 
marcus grown older thoughtful also altered somewhat short curling beard still marcus 
look look said 
nehushta nodded 
yes thought first 
seen lady shall going going said miriam wherefore one army may chance think building would useful break open walled door 
also might explore staircase answered miriam quietly taken 
jews find us party romans well greatly fear romans 
mean fear one roman 
knows may presently lie dead oh say answered miriam pressing hand upon heart 
nay safe unsafe see fight 
look yonder caleb yes caleb shouting jews 
fierce face like hyena snare 
nay go go leave peace watch end 
since heavy strong old arms carry steep steps answered nehushta calmly 
food us angels guard us well top tower dirty cisterns 
also fray worth watching 
spoke romans formed led prefect marcus officers advanced entrenchment met half way jews reinforced temple among caleb 
open space fought hand hand neither force would yield inch 
miriam watching stone bars eyes two multitude men marcus loved caleb feared 
marcus attacked jew stabbed horse instantly stabbed roman came rescue commander 
fought foot 
caleb killed first one soldier another 
watching miriam grew aware cutting way towards point point marcus 
marcus seemed know least also strove cut way towards caleb 
nearer nearer came till length met began rain blows upon long charge roman horsemen separated 
parties retired lines taking wounded 
thus pauses sometimes two three hours fight went morning noon noon sunset 
latter part time romans made attacks contented defending awaited reinforcements without city perhaps results counter attack another part 
thus advantage rested seemed rest jews held ruined houses swept open space arrows 
nehushta fears justified little leisure jews took beam wood battered walled doorway tower 
look said nehushta pointing 
oh nou miriam answered wrong 
run danger 
indeed could go 
shall sit quiet come take us said nehushta grimly give us time explain best may

saw sacred hill moriah whereon temple stood beginning rugged spot clothed ungrafted carob trees olives inhabited men wild boars hy nas preyed upon young 
almost center lay huge black stone 
stone came man clad garb arabs desert little lad bound upon stone though offer sacrifice 
plunge knife heart glory shone round place voice cried hold hand 
vision offering isaac 
passed came another vision 
saw sacred height moriah lo temple stood upon splendid building knew front temple black rock 
rock lad bound altar altar glorious man clad priestly robes offered sacrifice lambs oxen sonorous voice gave praise jehovah presence countless host people 
knew vision solomon king 
passed lo black rock stood another man pale eager faced piercing eyes reproached worshippers temple wickedness hearts drove scourge cords 
knew vision jesus son mary messiah worshipped drove people prophesied desolation fall upon fled mocked 
picture passed saw black rock lay beneath gilded dome light fell upon painted windows 
moved many priests whose worship strange seemed move ages 
length doors dome burst open upon priests rushed fair faced stately looking men clad white mail bearing upon shields breastplates symbol cross 
slaughtered votaries strange worship rock red blood 
gone turn priests moved beneath dome cross vanished thence pinnacles crowned crescents 
vision passed came another dim undistinguishable hordes tore crescents slaughtered ministers strange faith gave domed temple flames 
vision passed summit mount moriah beginning wild olive wild fig flourished among desolate terraces wild boar roamed beneath shade none hunt 
sunlight moonlight still beat upon ancient rock sacrifice 
vision passed lo around rock filling valley jehoshaphat valleys beyond mount olives mountains yes empty air earth sky eye could reach stood rank upon rank countless million millions mankind millions yet gazing every one anxiously utter silence upon scarred naked rock sacrifice 
upon rock grew glory bright sight million millions abased eyes 
glory pealed forth voice trumpet seemed say end beginning things accomplished order day decision 
dream sun turned red blood stars seemed fall winds shook world darkness covered winds darkness voices standing upon rock arms stretched east west cross fire filling heavens cross company upon company angels 
last vision judgment passed also miriam awoke haunted horror begotten sleep see watch fires romans burning court women court israel behind herded like cattle slaughterer yard hear groans starving jews morrow destined sword 
chapter xviii death struggle israel light began grow morning sun rose upon sight thousands waited coming 
whole heaven dark gray mist seemed drift billows sea bringing salt dampness

kneeling miriam loosed string bag teeth devoured crust bread returning thanks caleb moved thought 
bottle could drink hands bound behind able neither lift untie thong made fast neck 
therefore notwithstanding dew lapped needed drink sorely longed also use hands protect tormenting attacks stinging gnats carrion flies set try free 
gilt spike crowned pillar made fast angle irons let marble edge one irons projected somewhat rough 
looking thought came miriam mind might serve rub cord hands bound

romans came put captured sword yet attempt storming gates 
officers advanced near wall dared called jews surrender saying titus desired preserve temple spare lives 
jews answered insults taunts mockery miriam listening wondered spirit entered people made mad chose death destruction rather peace mercy 
remembered strange visions night seemed find answer 
repulsed desperate sally roman officers set thousands men work attempt extinguish flaming cloisters since notwithstanding answer jews titus still desired save temple 
defenders beyond guarding walls court israel 
gathering places protected darts stones thrown engines crouched upon ground sullen silence beating breasts rending robes women children wailed misery hunger throwing dust upon heads 
gate nicanor however still held strong guard suffered none approach attempt ascend roof 
caleb still lived miriam knew seen covered dust blood driven back charge roman horse steps gateway 
indeed one last pass closed barred keep pursuing romans

clamor shouting died away even mourners ceased pitiful cries except guards romans withdrawn eating evening meal worked terrible engines ceased destroying toil 
peace ominous peace brooded place everywhere save flames crackled among cedar wood beams roofs cloisters deep silence tropic lands precedes bursting cyclone 
miriam watched seemed though midst unnatural quiet jehovah withdrawing house spirit dwelt people worshipped lips rejected hearts 
tormented nerves shuddered fear body stared upwards immense arch azure evening sky half expecting mortal eyes would catch vision departing wings angel lord 
could see nothing except shapes hundreds high poised eagles 
carcase shall eagles gathered together muttered remembering four birds come feast upon bones whole people jews upon shut eyes groaned

die pass quick heaven would well perish inches starvation heat cold cramped limbs pains within without swimming sickness head ah hard bear
