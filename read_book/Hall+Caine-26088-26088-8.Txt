mr bonnithorne looked awkward 
well say truth mr christian rather 
old parson lifted two astonished eyes gazed mr bonnithorne rims spectacles 
lawyer uneasiness increased 
parson christian remembered little ago mr bonnithorne offered reasons paul marry greta 
rather secular reasons doubt appealed honestly mind friend greta family

know feeling serious 
let us leave decide morning said parson christian 
left mr bonnithorne dear friend family made haste telegraph office sent telegram hugh ritson london married morrow 
anything imperative say write night come 
paul greta saw five minutes day amid general hubbub words pregnant serious issues 
beneath chorus hearts joy undersong discord neither knew perplexity 
greta thinking hugh ritson mysterious threat 
whether hugh power preventing marriage question less consequence greta moment question whether could tell paul hugh said 
day wore uncertainty became feverish 
spoke must reveal hitherto partly hidden importunity unbrotherly disloyalty hugh love 
must also awaken fresh distress paul mind already overburdened grief loss mother 
probably paul would powerless interpret brother strange language 
puzzled must pained 
perhaps hugh ritson threat nothing outburst distempered spirit noise bladder emptying 
still greta nervousness increased reason sophistry could allay 
felt like blind man knows current air face reached two street crossings decide turn take 
paul part grave question revolve 
thinking whether act honorable man let greta marry ignorance fact father legitimate son 
yet could never tell 
oath taken father body must seal lips forever 
mother honor wrapped oath 
break one longer inviolate 
true would greta greta alone one 
true mother dead world 
oath rigid never reveal human soul word deed act shame 
sworn must keep 
conflict emotion terrible 
love dragging one way love 
honor said yes honor said 
heart first thought tell greta everything keep nothing back whose heart last thought 
secret birth must lie dead speechless thing within 
act honorable man let greta marry ignorance birth one escape dishonor let marry 
married oath must kept 
oath kept marriage might dishonored could unreserved complete union soul soul heart heart mind mind true marriage meant 
would laying treasure altar keeping back part price 
paul man subtle intellect perhaps reflections would troubled deeply 
love everything give greta impossible 
circumstance evil genius man life made god also hazards paul meant marry greta 
question honor amount mere phantasm 
matter greta whether high basely born love less would less worthy love birth base god eyes god heard voice hagar son 
eyes world 
mean meant whether birth high base depended one part virtue nine hundred ninety nine parts money 
half world titled great ones sprung like father father fathers monarch favorite 
thus paul reasoned juncture 
whether wholly right wholly wrong partly right partly wrong concerns us 
natural man place hour decide say word greta 
natural reticence produce long series incidents still recorded 
thus word said lay nearest hearts

cabman bought torch passer stuck whip barrel 
reached busier thoroughfares got box took torch one hand reins walked horse head 
pace slower 
like toilsome passage workings iron mine 
volumes noisome vapor rolled slowly past 
air hung close heads like unseen vaulted roof 
red lights gleamed like vanishing stars elastic vista 
one light would turn coffee stall round group people gathered cabmen muffled throat women draggled dirty boys faces old 
another would potato engine volumes white vapor clank oven door like metallic echo miner pick 
line regular lamps like line candles stuck rock cross streets like cross workings damp air settling streaks moisture glass cab window like ceasless drip drip oozing water overhead 
two laden souls sitting within silence clasped hands great city nay world like colossal mine human earthworms burrowed underground light free air 
one point patch dry pavement indicated bake house street three four squalid creatures crouched together slept 
streets noiseless
