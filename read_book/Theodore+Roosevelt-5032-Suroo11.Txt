call attention congress desirability carrying suggestions 
dealing questions immigration naturalization indispensable keep certain facts ever minds share enacting laws 
first foremost let us remember question good american nothing whatever man birthplace creed 
every generation time government founded men foreign birth stood foremost rank good citizenship merely one every field american activity try draw distinction man whose parents came country man whose ancestors came several generations back mere absurdity 
good americanism matter heart conscience lofty aspiration sound common sense birthplace creed 
medal honor highest prize serve army navy united states decorates men born also decorates men born great britain ireland germany scandinavia france doubtless countries also 
field statesmanship field business field philanthropic endeavor equally true among men proud americans distinction whatever drawn whose parents came sailing ship steamer across water whose ancestors stepped ashore wooded wilderness plymouth mouth hudson delaware james nearly three centuries ago 
fellow citizen entitled peculiar regard way worships maker birthplace parents way discriminated therefor 
must stand worth man entitled judged solely thereby 
danger many immigrants right kind 
makes difference country come 
sound body mind good character rest assured children grandchildren worthy fellow citizens children grandchildren welcome cordial hospitality 
citizenship country debased 
vital keep high standard well among wage workers therefore admit masses men whose standards living whose personal customs habits tend lower level american wage worker admit man unworthy type man concerning say bad citizen children grandchildren detract instead adding sum good citizenship country 
similarly take greatest care naturalization 
fraudulent naturalization naturalization improper persons curse government affair every honest voter wherever born see fraudulent voting allowed fraud connection naturalization permitted 
past year cases false fraudulent improper naturalization aliens coming attention executive branches government increased alarming degree 
extensive sales forged certificates naturalization discovered well many cases naturalization secured perjury fraud addition instances accumulated showing many courts issue certificates naturalization carelessly upon insufficient evidence 
constitution power congress establish uniform rule naturalization numerous laws time time enacted purpose supplemented states state laws special application 
federal statutes permit naturalization court record united states common law jurisdiction seal clerk except police court district columbia nearly courts exercise important function 
results many courts varying grades jurisdiction lack uniformity rules applied conferring naturalization 
courts strict others lax 
alien may secure naturalization one place might denied another intent constitutional provision fact defeated 
furthermore certificates naturalization issued courts differ widely wording appearance brought use foreign countries frequently subject suspicion 
comprehensive revision naturalization laws 
courts power naturalize definitely named national authority testimony upon naturalization may conferred definitely prescribed publication impending naturalization applications required advance hearing court form wording certificates issued uniform throughout country courts required make returns secretary state stated periods naturalizations conferred 
laws relating naturalization defective relating citizenship united states ought also made subject scientific inquiry view probable legislation 
acts expatriation may assumed accomplished long american citizen may reside abroad receive protection passport whether degree protection extended one made declaration intention become citizen united states secured naturalization questions serious import involving personal rights often producing friction government foreign governments 
yet upon question laws silent 
recommend examination made subjects citizenship expatriation protection americans abroad view appropriate legislation 
power government protect integrity elections officials inherent recognized affirmed repeated declarations supreme court

two cases referred may real conflict unfortunate even apparent conflict 
present way government cause conflict occurs solved appeal higher court wheels justice blocked without real decision question 
strongly urge passage bill question 
failure pass result seriously hampering government effort obtain justice especially wealthy individuals corporations wrong may also prevent government obtaining justice wage workers able effectively contest case judgment inferior court 
specifically view recent decision district judge leaving railway employees without remedy violation certain called labor statute

importance enacting law particular bill question increased fact government definitely begun policy resorting criminal law trust interstate commerce cases course offers reasonable chance success 
first proper every effort made enforce laws civil proceedings become increasingly evident action government finally deciding certain cases undertake criminal proceedings justifiable though conspicuous failures cases many successes undoubtedly deterrent effect upon evil doers whether penalty inflicted shape fine imprisonment penalties kinds already inflicted courts

yet many judges assume matter course granting preliminary injunction ordinary proper judicial disposition cases undoubtedly flagrant wrongs committed judges connection labor disputes even within last years although think much less often former years 
judges unwise action immensely strengthen hands striving entirely away power injunction therefore careless use injunctive process tends threaten existence american people ever become convinced process habitually abused whether matters affecting labor matters affecting corporations well nigh impossible prevent abolition
