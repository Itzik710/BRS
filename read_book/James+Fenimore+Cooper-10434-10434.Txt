pleasure diving virgin forest commencing labors civilization exact parallel human occupation 
building laying grounds certainly resemblance resemblance faint distant scarcely liken enjoyment produces 
former approaches nearer feeling creating far pregnant anticipations hopes though first effects seldom agreeable sometimes nearly hideous 
captain however escaped last consequences possessing advantage clearing without going usual processes chopping burning first leaves earth dotted many years unsightly stumps rains snows wash hues last several seasons 
exclamation betrayed pleasure mrs willoughby got first glimpse drained pond 
clambered point rocks stream began tumble downward valley

stood thirty rods northern side area nearly central eastern western boundaries presented slope inclining towards south 
greatest height northern end rose rich alluvion soil literally rock forty feet perpendicular height summit acre level land falling three sides east west precipitously south quite gently regularity 
accidental formation induced captain select spot site residence dwelling far post place difficult access something like military defences merely precautions ordinary prudence 
pond remained islet susceptible made strong usual assaults indian warfare basin drained great advantages purpose 
perpendicular rock north even overhung plain 
almost inaccessible formation sides offered singular facilities dwelling security 
captain familiar finesse indian stratagem resolved improve following manner first place directed men build massive wall stone hundred fifty feet length six feet height
