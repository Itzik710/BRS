task must given race time ready undertaking 
whole future world would changed period trans oceanic expansion among nations europe begun time scandinavians germans foremost sea trade sea war begun fleets norsemen threatened coasts hanseatic league prime

interest race individual opposed 
even strong race prime given task right moment usually fails perform moment immense importance opportunity hardly ever understood selfish interests individual generation opposed interest race whole

swedish successors gustavus adolphus devoted energies colonization america instead squabbling slavs germans one two wretched baltic provinces could undoubtedly built new world sweden tenfold greater old 
france sent possessions america many colonists sent soldiers war petty townships germany italy french would masters half territory north rio grande 
england alone combination causes able use aright chances given conquest settlement world waste spaces consequence english speaking peoples future important continental european peoples combined 
race indifferent future 
natural nations thus blind possibilities future 
indeed men look score years future fewer still make great sacrifices real fancied good children children questions race supremacy look ahead centuries rather decades self sacrifice individual must good next generation perchance fourth fifth line descent 
frenchman hollander seventeenth century could even dimly see possibilities loomed vast vague colonization america australia hardly possible remotest idea would well surrender one glory gained german conquests riches reaped east indian trade order three hundred years later huge unknown continents filled french dutch commonwealths 
nation taken whole ever see far future nation even could see future would ever sacrifice much win 
hitherto race turn expanded interests certain number individuals many succeeding generations made active vigorous agents work expansion 
indifference marked new old communities 
indifference part individuals growth race often nearly marked new old communities although existence new communities depends upon growth 
strange see new settlers new land tend turn faces towards world towards world left behind 
many perhaps wish rather take parts struggles old civilized powers share laying obscure gigantic foundations empires future 
new englander personally interested lands beyond alleghanies often felt indifferent hostile growth trans montane america turn mountain men kentuckians tennesseans concerned obtain port mouth mississippi rather right move westward pacific 
men new communities old saw however imperfectly grandeur opportunity race destiny always many share working destiny grudgingly protest

united states great britain 
attitude united states great britain faced one another western wilderness beginning year another illustration truth fact 
british held lake posts less actively supported indians efforts bar americans northwest 
nominally held posts americans left unfulfilled conditions treaty peace felt real reason americans loudly protested conduct due sheer hatred young republic 
explanation simpler 
british far reaching design prevent spread growth english speaking people american continent 
cared nothing one way spread growth unlikely wasted moment thought ultimate future race 
desired preserve valuable fur trade region round great lakes benefit 
acting motives self interest usually control nations never entered heads balance immediate interests future nation many whose members mere foreigners 
reluctance americans enter war indians 
majority americans side exceedingly loth enter aggressive war indians reluctantly forced contest necessity supporting backwoodsmen 
frontier pushed westward leading statesmen america bulk american people foresaw continental greatness country strove greatness bordermen west adventurous land speculators east personally interested acquiring new territory governmental representatives nation finally forced make interests westerners 
people seaboard leaders opinion coast towns old settled districts inclined look eastward rather westward 
interested quarrels old world nations immediately concerned rights fisheries jealously shared england trade sought secure spain 
covet indian lands 
never heard rocky mountains nobody yet cared little missouri congo thought pacific slope savage country reached ocean voyage longer voyage india 
believed entitled treaty country alleghanies great lakes quite content see indians remain actual occupancy desire spend men money driving 
nevertheless even less disposed proceed extremities people fact driving indians alternative end side one set combatants 
governmental authorities newly created republic shared feelings 
felt hunger indian lands felt desire stretch boundaries thereby add already heavy burdens responsibilities 
wished strict justice indians treaties held carried scrupulous fairness honorably lived united states officials 
government especially averse war 
strove keep peace made many efforts persuade frontiersmen observe indian boundary lines intrude territory dispute quite unable foresee rapidity nation westward growth 
like people eastern seaboard men high governmental authority apt look upon frontiersmen feelings dangerously akin dislike suspicion 
feelings wholly unjustifiable 
men settle new country begin subduing wilderness plunge back conditions race raised slow toil ages 
inevitable shortcomings frontiersmen 
conditions tell upon 
inevitably one lifetime perhaps several generations tend retrograde instead advancing 
drop away standard highly civilized nations reached 
harsh dangerous labor bring new land towards level old partly revert ancestral conditions sink back towards state ages dead barbarian forefathers 
observers see beyond temporary retrogression future preparation 
small cause wonder fact many leaders eastern thought looked coldness upon effort westerners push north ohio 
westerners solved problem 
yet western frontiersmen real vital factors solution problems annoyed british monarchy american republic 
eagerly craved indian lands would denied entrance thinly peopled territory wherein intended make homes children 
rough masterful lawless neither daunted prowess red warriors whose wrath braved awed displeasure government whose solemn engagements violated 
enormous extent frontier dividing white settler savage tangled inaccessibility country everywhere lay rendered difficult national authorities control frontiersmen chastise indians 
east backed west 
separation interests thickly settled east sparsely settled west complete may east would refused outright support west case advance would slow halting 
separation complete 
frontiersmen numerically important states virginia georgia even pennsylvania new york democratic system government meant states less responsive demands 
greatly interest frontiersmen demands gratified citizens concrete concern matter one way 
addition even important fact large classes population everywhere felt much sense identity frontiersmen sympathized 
fathers grandfathers peoples frontiersmen still influences traditions told constant march westward vast forests less constant warfare hostile savagery 
moreover many communities people whose kinsmen friends gone border welfare adventurers matter less interest stayed behind 
finally important though nation might lukewarm originally might wish prevent settlers trespassing indian lands entering indian war yet war become real moment victory doubtful national power sure used favor hard pressed pioneers 
government ultimately supports frontiersmen 
first authorities national capital would blame whites try temporize make new treaties even threaten drive back settlers strong hand ravages indians become serious bloody details sent homes every part union letter letter border little newspapers began publish accounts worst atrocities county lieutenants frontier counties clamoring help congressmen frontier districts appealing congress governors states whose frontiers molested appealing president feeling race national kinship rose government longer hesitated support every way hard pressed wilderness vanguard american people

indians professed much satisfaction change course least understand cared nothing 
easy acquiescence gave much groundless satisfaction lewis clark spirit philanthropy strove make tribe swear peace neighbors 
hesitation tribe usually consented also explorers greatly gratified passed 
needless say soon disappeared tribes promptly went war reality indians vaguest idea meant ceremonies hoisting american flag 
wonder clark already experience indians supposed councils advice proclamations would effect kind hoped upon wild savages
