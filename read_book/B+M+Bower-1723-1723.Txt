step half packed hastily departed ahead 
father cowboys watching cottonwood grove many rods buddy right well background would glance way 
even would see saw would madness ride back though man among would wheeled tracks returned buddy face colorou band 
cottonwoods came pound galloping hoofs 
angels nothing cried buddy deep disgust scuttled cabin 
cabin knew ran worst place world boy wanted much go living 
gaping doorway saw odds ends food lying table dared stop long enough get 
indians thundering corral rounded cabin corner glanced back saw foremost riders whipping horses trail fleeing white men 
knew would stop 
even prospect fresh scalps could hold greedy ones prowling around white man dwelling place 
might tobacco whiskey left behind something color shine 
buddy knew well ways indians 
made creek thinking first hide somewhere brush along bank 
fearing brightening light day wide space must cross reach first fringe brush stopped dugout cellar built creek bank high water mark 
pole dirt roof dirt sifted poles whenever wind blew always place crudely sealed inside split poles overlapping one another 
ceiling less flat roof slight slope 
middle tiny attic thus formed buddy managed worm body hole gable next creek 
wriggled back end next cabin lay flat quiet peeping half inch crack wise ways silence hold breath must heave sigh relieve lungs 
hard breathe naturally easily swift dash somehow 
indian swerved ridden behind cabin leaning peering directions see anyone remained 
perhaps suspected ambush buddy absolutely certain fellow looking personally seen buddy run toward creek 
pleasant thought fact knew buck indian name traded jackknife beautifully tanned wolf skin mother make pleasanter 
hides face would let past friendliness stand way killing 
presently hides face dismounted tied horse corner log cabin went inside others see could find could eaten carried 
buddy saw fresh smoke issue stone chimney guessed step half left something could cooked 
became evident course hour presence absolutely unsuspected buddy began watch composedly silently promising especial forms punishment one one knew 
ranch many times could called dozen name 
sat father cabin stood immobile within door listened mother played sang 
fed cakes buddy remembered good things mother given despicable ones looting gobbling destroying like drove hogs turned loose garden thought wasted kindness turned sick rage 
mother believed friendliness 
buddy wished mother could see setting fire low log stable corral swarming cabin 
painted war red stripes across foreheads ribs outlined red loosened blankets sun warmed gave fantastic likeness skeletons buddy wished red stripes arms number showing rank tribe open seated buckskin breeches knees met tightly wrapped leggings moccasins laced snugly ankle picturesque enough eyes buddy saw ghoulish greed eyes heard voices shouted one another hated even feared

cursing tomahawk outfit chiefly men waited surprised killed 
cursed father particular half sorry ridden pursuit others 
hoped white man would ride alive laramie 
made cheerful listening buddy flat stomach roof dugout cabin gutted everything contained save crude table benches indians brought burning brands stable set afire 
busy inside making sure flames took hold properly 
dry logs began blaze flames licked edges roof stood back watched 
buddy saw hides face glance speculatively toward dugout slipped hand back could reach six shooter 
felt pretty certain meant demolish dugout next knew exactly meant 
heard men posts talk selling lives dearly intended 
going much hurry would wait actually began dugout bank within feet saw getting away death meant shoot five indians last 
tentatively felt temple meant place muzzle gun one bullet left 
nice smooth wondered god would really help said father pure heart faith mother said one must pray 
slightly doubtful conditions came think seriously 
spring felt grown enough swear little horses sometimes sure shooting indian time would counted crime god loved creatures 
mother always stuck injuns god creatures brought buddy squarely incredible assumption god must love 
least mean irreverent watched painted bucks opinion god changed slightly 
decided neither pure full faith would pray yet 
would let god go ahead pleased except buddy would never let indians get alive matter god expected 
hides face walked toward dugout 
buddy crooked left arm laid gun barrel across get dead rest leave nothing chance 
hides face stared dugout moved one side muzzle gun followed keeping aim directly left edge breastbone outlined red paint 
hides face craned stepped path bank passed range 
buddy gritted teeth malevolently waited ears strained catch interpret meaning every soft sound made hides face moccasins 
hides face cautiously pushed open door cellar looked standing interminable minutes leisurely way indians great need haste 
ruddy cautiously lowered face peered like mouse thatch could handily bring gun bear upon hides face presently turned back went path shoulder muscles moving snakishly brown skin climbed bank 
hides face returned others announced place could camp 
buddy could hear said hides face back turned signs intelligible gathered particular indians chosen ordered wait three suns cellar appealed hides face shelter case stormed 
buddy know whether rejoice news mourn 
would destroy dugout need shoot course relief 
still three suns meant three days nights prospect lying stomach afraid move length time almost amounted thing end 
believe could hold long though course would try pretty hard 
day buddy lay watching crack determined take chance came way 
none came 
indians loitered shade slept 
always two three remained awake although sat apparently ready doze minute buddy knew well hope good luck 
two indians rode toward evening dragging calf overlooked roundup improvidently burned cabin meat cooked embers still smouldered places knots logs made slow fuel 
buddy watched hungrily wondering long took starve 
growing dark tried keep mind exact positions indians discover whether guard would placed camp whether felt safe enough sleep without sentinel 
hides face long ago decided charge party hides face seemingly concerned gorging half roasted meat 
buddy hoped would choke hides face good gulping half chewed hunks finished without disaster 
grunted something someone dark movement group 
buddy ground growing second teeth together clenched fist said damn three times silent crescendo rage could neither see hear took place immediately repented profanity remembering god could hear 
buddy opinion never could sure god bestowed mysterious mercies strange punishments ways past finding 
buddy tipped palms together repeated prayers mother taught flash memory finished oh god please mother done long ago dry drive 
meditated uncomfortably minutes added faint whisper oh shucks want pay attention fellow cussing little mad 
could easy make helped way 
buddy believed afterwards god yielded persuasion decided give chance 
five minutes passed far murmur grew indefinable roar wind whooped snowies fiercely even dugout quivered little rattled dirt buddy poles head 
first seemed unlucky circumstance indians came dugout shelter buddy afraid breathe quiet intervals gusts 
could hear occasional mutters laconic sentences grunted answers bucks settled night short panicky spell fearing poles would give way beneath drop upon 
seemed hours buddy wind settled steady gale 
indians far could determine asleep cellar 
buddy setting teeth hard together began slide slowly backward toward opening crawled roof 
crawled noticed springiness poles imagination tormented sensation sagging swaying 
feet pushed opening grit teeth hold steady 
seemed someone reaching dark catch legs pull 
nothing happened however little inched backward hung elbows hooked desperately inside opening head shoulders within protesting every nerve leaving shelter 
buddy said afterwards guessed hung daylight afraid time change guard somebody might catch
