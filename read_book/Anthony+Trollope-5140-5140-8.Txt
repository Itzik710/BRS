mandarins though hospitality duty gentlemen ate sir rowley dinners exactly men lady rowley desired welcome bosoms sons law 
mr trevelyan came way desirous seeing everything somewhat indefinite course travels emily rowley eldest flock twenty years age seen yet mandariner exactly came fancy 
louis trevelyan remarkably handsome young man well connected ninth wrangler cambridge already published volume poems possessed year arising various perfectly secure investments forced sigh long vain 
indeed rowleys one felt providence good sending young trevelyan travels direction seemed pearl among men 
sir marmaduke lady rowley felt might objections marriage proposed raised trevelyan family 
lady rowley would liked daughter go england received cold looks strangers 
soon appeared one make objections 
louis lover living relative nearer cousins 
father barrister repute died widower left money made child 
head family first cousin lived cornwall moderate property good sort stupid fellow louis said would quite indifferent marriage cousin might make 
man could independent clearly justified pleasing lover 
proposed second daughter nora come live london 
lover fall suddenly heavens dovecote penny piece give either said sir rowley 
idea girls fortunes said trevelyan 
rate quite sure men never look money 
man must comfortable think likely affectionate money belonged 
sir rowley high minded gentleman would liked handed thousand pounds giving daughters thousands pounds hand could admire principles proposed son law 
time leave absence sundry girls went england mr trevelyan wedding celebrated london rev oliphant outhouse saint diddulph east married sir rowley sister 
small house taken furnished curzon street mayfair rowleys went back seat government leaving nora second girl charge elder sister 
rowleys found reaching london lighted upon pearl indeed 
louis trevelyan man people said good things 
might fellow college man fortune 
might already sir rowley told parliament thought wiser wait awhile 
indeed wise many things 
gone travels thus young search excitement kill beasts encounter knew novelty amusement might see men know world 
travels year winds blew mandarins 
oh blessed winds moreover sir rowley found son law well spoken clubs known university career man popular well wise book worm dry philosopher prig 
could talk subjects generous man sure honored respected handsome manly fellow short brown hair nose divinely chiselled apollo mouth six feet high shoulders legs arms proportion pearl pearls lady rowley first find liked way 
way good way said sir marmaduke 
good guide girls emily likes way said lady rowley 
sir marmaduke argued matter thought doubt husband louis trevelyan entitled way 
probably observed daughter temper accurately wife done 
eight coming around observed tempers rate anything amiss emily temper would well find master husband louis trevelyan 
nearly two years little household curzon street went well anything matter one outside little household aware 
baby boy young louis baby household apt make things go sweetly 
marriage taken place july wedding tour winter spring london passed month two sea side baby born 
came another winter another spring 
nora rowley london time mr trevelyan begun think like way completely 
baby nice wife clever pretty attractive 
nora unmarried sister 
come trouble bitter words 
lady rowley right said daughter emily also liked way 
suspected said mrs trevelyan sister one morning sat together little back drawing room life worth 
talk suspected emily mean saying would rather colonel osborne man older father known since baby mean anything kind emily 
know say 
would horrible think 
great deal horrible spoken know 
beg pardon shall shall continue live course sort upper servant baby 
shall know think feel 
would forget 
forget nothing pleases 
civil kind master know things says 
tell colonel osborne come heavens earth ever hold head driven day doubt louis sit library hear step come 
tell richard say home 
yes everybody understand 
deny way best oldest friend orders given let give see come 
mrs trevelyan described colonel osborne truly far words went saying known since baby older man father 
colonel osborne age exceeded father month past fifty might considered perhaps respect safe friend young married woman 
every respect man different sir marmaduke 
sir marmaduke blessed time burdened wife eight daughters condemned pass large portion life within tropics become fifty many people call quite middle aged man 
say one effervescence elasticity salt youth altogether passed away 
fat slow thinking much wife eight daughters thinking much also dinner 
colonel osborne bachelor burdens imposed upon position member parliament man fortune world easy 
therefore said decidedly sir marmaduke middle aged man although probably already lived two thirds life 
good looking man age bald indeed top head considerable sprinkling gray hair bushy beard upright carriage active quick step dressed well clearly determined make could remained advantages youth 
colonel osborne always dressed one ever observed nature garments doubt well aware man twenty five afford call special attention coat hat cravat trousers nevertheless matter one paid much attention means lax ascertaining tailor 
always rode pretty horse mounted groom one rate pretty 
known excellent stud shires reputation going well hounds 
poor sir marmaduke could ridden hunt save either government credit 
therefore mrs trevelyan declared sister colonel osborne man entitled regard semi parental feelings veneration older father made comparison true letter spirit 
asserted colonel osborne known since baby fell mistake 
colonel osborne indeed known baby old days intimate friend father seen little nothing since baby days till met become mrs trevelyan though natural old friend come congratulate renew friendship nevertheless true made appearance husband house guise useful old family friend gives silver cups children kisses little girls sake old affection borne parents 
know appearance old gentleman pleasant dear fellow welcome face within gate free makes wine generally abusing tells eldest daughter light candle gave silver cups girls born bestows tea services get married useful safe charming fellow year younger looking nimble without life would blank 
know man man colonel osborne house mr trevelyan young bride 
emily rowley brought home mandarin islands wife louis trevelyan handsome young woman tall bust rather full age dark eyes eyes looked dark eye brows eye lashes nearly black truth varying color could tell hue 
brown hair dark soft tint complexion brown also though color cheeks often bright induce enemies say falsely painted 
strong girls come tropics tropical climate suited 
could sit horse whole day long would never weary dancing government house balls 
colonel osborne introduced baby known thought would pleasant intimate pleasant friend meaning harm indeed men mean harm occasions still regarding beautiful young woman seen one generation succeeding would duty make useful account old friendship bore father 
moreover well known london though known mrs trevelyan ancient lothario made troublesome one family 
fond intimacies married ladies perhaps averse excitement marital hostility 
must remembered however hostility allusion made hostility pistol horsewhip indeed generally hostility word spoken anger 
young husband may dislike friendly bearing friend may yet abstain outrage dignity wife conveyed word suspicion 
louis trevelyan taken strong dislike colonel osborne failed make wife understand dislike induced throw cold water upon colonel friendship allowed speak word probably would willingly recalled soon spoken 
words spoken recalled many man many woman spoken word regretted far proud express regret 
louis trevelyan told wife wish colonel osborne come often house 
said flashing eye angry tone though seen eye flash familiar angry tone never felt insulted husband 
soon word spoken trevelyan left room gone among books 
alone knew insulted wife 
quite aware spoken gently explained arm round waist would better friend friendship limited 
much turn eye tone given word things said much importance words 
trevelyan thought remembered manner much anger expressed far arm round wife waist spoke almost made mind go stairs apologise 
one whose nature giving apology repulsive 
could bear wrong 
wife provoking manner 
endeavored make understand wishes certain disparaging hints thrown colonel osborne saying dangerous man one show true character snake grass man without settled principles like wife taken cudgels friend openly declared believe word things alleged 
still true husband said 
doubt think wife replied 
men believe evil one another often 
must excuse say think mistaken 
known colonel osborne much longer done louis papa always highest opinion 
mr trevelyan become angry spoken words could recall 
walked fro among books stairs almost felt ought beg wife pardon 
knew wife well enough sure would forgive unless 
would thought exactly 
moment would come might easier present 
would able assure went dress dinner meant harm 
going dine house lady rank countess dowager milborough lady standing high world esteem wife stood little awe calculated feeling make task easy would yet take difficulty 
emily would exactly cowed prospect lady milborough dinner perhaps little reduced usual self assertion 
would say word dressing assuring intended animadvert slightest degree upon conduct 
illustration shewing wrath began 
luncheon served two ladies went dining room 
mr trevelyan appear 
nothing singular accustomed declare luncheon meal much day man eat nothing beyond biscuit breakfast dinner 
would sometimes come eat biscuit standing hearth rug drink would call half quarter glass sherry 
would probably well done remained library behind dining room wife sister law gone stairs became anxious learn whether colonel osborne would come day whether would admitted 
told nora rowley called another lady mrs fairfax go look pictures 
wife declined join mrs fairfax party declared going dine would leave baby afternoon 
louis trevelyan though strove apply mind article writing scientific quarterly review could keep anxiety expected visit colonel osborne 
least jealous 
swore fifty times feeling part would monstrous injury wife 
nevertheless knew would gratified special day colonel osborne informed wife home

louis trevelyan sitting library also knew whose coming knock gave notice 
chapter ii 
colonel osborne 
already said colonel osborne bachelor man fortune member parliament one carried half century years lightly shoulders 
necessary say man popular among lived politician sportsman member society 
could speak well house though spoke seldom generally thought might something considerable suited better nothing 
supposed conservative generally voted conservative party could boast altogether independent occasion would take trouble proving 
possession excellent health world could give fond books pictures architecture china various tastes means indulging one men seems every pleasant thing lavished 
little slur good name allusion made knew colonel osborne best generally willing declare harm intended evils arose always attributed mistaken jealousy 
friends said free pleasant way women women like pleasant way free friendship harm come always come false suspicion 
certain ladies town good motherly discreet women hated name colonel osborne would admit within doors would bow people houses would always speak serpent hyena kite shark 
old lady milborough one daughter friend admitted serpent intimacy 
augustus poole wise enough take wife abroad said old lady milborough discussing time gossip danger mrs trevelyan position would break yet never better girl world jane marriott 
reader may quite certain colonel osborne premeditated evil intention allowed become intimate friend old friend daughter 
nothing fiendish nature 
man boasted conquests 
ravening wolf going seeking might devour determined devour whatever might come way liked pleasant pleasant things company pretty clever woman pleasantest 
exact period life woman pleasantly pretty agreeably clever mrs trevelyan

heard jane marriott carried naples become mrs poole 
must carry wife naples order place reach hyena terrible think must pack everything run away one colonel osborne 
even consent could explain wife whose sake would got hint reason would doubt refuse go 
thought visit stairs prolonged almost thought would best round know husband means resolves round wife 
began think would apologise words spoken would speak somewhat sharply

ladies always like political jobs think make politics bearable

committee voted two governors brought home purpose giving evidence 
arrangement could pleasant governor living mandarin islands holiday lately could ill afford take holidays expense colonel osborne committee moreover good terms colonial office 
men office would glad colonel osborne service job would little job perhaps sir marmaduke might best man purpose 
perhaps government mandarins afford best specimen colonial lore business committee master 
two governors come might well one best sort one second best 
one supposed excellent old sir marmaduke paragon governor infinity experience twenty years island island least steered clear great scrapes

immediately afterwards colonel osborne went away mrs trevelyan left alone drawing room 
knew husband still stairs listened moment hear whether would come 
heard colonel step went moments doubted whether would go wife 
though believed man firm purpose mind oscillated backwards forwards within last quarter hour two purposes round wife begging pardon words already spoken 
believed would best duty plan round would much pleasanter rate much easier beg pardon 
one thing quite certain must means exclude colonel osborne house

chapter iii 
lady milborough dinner party 
louis trevelyan went club pall mall acrobats heard rumor added anger colonel osborne 
acrobats distinguished club difficult young man find way almost impossible man longer young therefore known many 
founded twenty years since idea promoting muscular exercise gymnastic amusements promoters become fat lethargic acrobats spent time mostly playing whist ordering eating dinners

hitherto indeed wife reader knows could told

angry first learned club thought ought learned home 
soon reached house went wife room maid nothing could said moment 
dressed intending go emily soon girl left girl remained believed kept room purposely wife moment private conversation

half minute said wife 
got hired brougham standing door 
trevelyan sweet days early confidence wife offered keep carriage explaining luxury though costly would beyond reach 
persuaded carriage come agreement instead carriage always autumn tour 
one learns something going one learns nothing keeping carriage emily said 
happy days intended everything always rose colored 
meditating whether lieu autumn tour would necessary take wife away naples altogether might removed influence even would think colonel osborne wife lover 
idea horrible yet dreadful reason withdraw influence man lady milborough lived ever far away eccleston square trevelyan say single word either companions journey 
cross vexed conscious knew cross vexed 
mrs trevelyan sister talked whole way tone clearly indicates conversation made interest attached questions asked answers given expedient silence 
nora said something marshall snellgrove tried make believe anxious sister answer 
emily said something opera covent garden intended show mind quite ease 
failed altogether knew failed 
twice trevelyan thought would say word token repentance 
like naughty child knew naughty trying good 
could 
fiend strong within 
must known proposition father return colonel osborne influence 
man club heard could known got lady milborough door spoken neither 
large dull party made mostly old people 
lady milborough trevelyan mother bosom friends lady milborough account taken upon much interested trevelyan wife 
louis trevelyan discussing lady milborough emily rather turned mother old friend ridicule emily course followed husband mode thinking 
lady milborough twice given advice small matters telling air would good baby explaining mother certain interesting portion life refresh certain kind malt liquor 
counsel domestic subjects mrs trevelyan impatient indeed nature matters consequently authorized husband manner speaking mother friend taken habit quizzing lady milborough behind back almost continuing practice old lady face 
lady milborough affectionate old soul alive good tempered friends fault never resented come fear mrs trevelyan perhaps little flighty 
never yet allowed say anything worse young friend wife 
would always add kind thing would cure nursery became full 
must understood therefore mrs trevelyan anticipating much pleasure lady milborough party accepted invitation matter duty 
present among guests certain honourable charles glascock eldest son lord peterborough made affair interesting nora sister 
whispered nora ears one person among others lady milborough whose daughters married might thought fit become honourable mrs charles glascock 
whether might think fit whether might presence gentleman circumstances far concerned gave interest evening 
lady milborough took care mr glascock take nora dinner interest great 
mr glascock good looking man forty parliament heir peerage known well respect income 
lady milborough mrs trevelyan told nora rowley encouragement direction come way ought allow fall love mr glascock 
certain amount encouragement come way yet allowed fall love mr glascock 
seemed mr glascock quite conscious advantages position powers talking matters immediately connected limited 
believe truth paid compliment falling love compliment girls indifferent 
nora might perhaps tried fall love mr glascock forced make comparisons another 
one fallen love well knew certainly fallen love 
still comparison forced upon result favor mr glascock 
present occasion mr glascock sat next almost proposed 
never seen monkhams said 
monkhams father seat grand place worcestershire

unmarried man talks young lady really showing house destiny live hardly mean invite live 
must least purpose signify duly encouraged invite 
nora rowley give mr glascock much encouragement occasion 
afraid likely anything ever take part country said 
something perhaps tone checked mr glascock press invitation 
ladies stairs drawing room lady milborough contrived seat couch intended two persons close mrs trevelyan 
emily thinking might perhaps hear advice guinness stout prepared saucy 
matter hand graver 
lady milborough mind uneasy colonel osborne

want give little hint sure believe quite unnecessary continued lady milborough 
paused trevelyan would speak

face became still blacker still man said nothing 
dare say prejudice part always disliked 
think dangerous friend call snake grass 
though emily high good sense love general feelings subject husband must desire indeed quite sure possibility anything wrong never entered head 
purity innocence makes danger 
bad man would say word make understand coming morning desirable 
upon word believe nothing likes much going making mischief men wives 
thus delivered louis trevelyan though sore angry could feel taken part friend 
said true said said

first idea two sisters go house aunt mrs outhouse 
mrs outhouse wife reader may perhaps remember clergyman living east london 
st diddulph east much east indeed 
parish outside city lying near river populous poor low character uncomfortable 
rectory house queerly situated end little blind lane gate called garden twenty yards square 
rectory st diddulph said comfortable abode 
neighborhood certainly alluring 
visiting society within distance three four miles none afforded families east end clergymen 
mr outhouse somewhat singular man 
religious devoted work kind poor unfortunately strongly biased man time obstinate withal 
never allied cordially wife brother sir marmaduke allowing carried away prejudice people living west end frequented clubs connected way fashion could appropriate companions 
title sir marmaduke acquired repulsive induced tell wife sir sir could fitting associates poor east end clergyman 
wife niece married man fashion man supposed st diddulph closely allied fashion mr outhouse never induced even dine house curzon street 
therefore heard mr mrs trevelyan separated within two years marriage could expected eager lend two sisters use rectory 
interviews mr outhouse trevelyan mrs outhouse niece interview mr outhouse emily decided mrs trevelyan would go parsonage st diddulph outspoken uncle declaring means intended carry disgraced woman 
mr outhouse quoted st paul wives obey husbands

mother wanted clock house would sooner taken happened family sake 
miss stanbury alone read niece three letters began understand something priscilla honesty began also perceive might great difficulty respecting colonel neither niece sister law could fairly held responsible 
perhaps plainest characteristic stanburys never wilfully dishonest 
ignorant prejudiced passionate might 
anger miss stanbury exeter could almost malicious niece nuncombe putney like aunt 
could say cruel things unjust things actuated mistaken consciousness perfect right side 
neither could lie even silence 
let error brought home either acknowledged home error would assuredly confessed aloud 
indeed differences shades hugh dorothy nature
