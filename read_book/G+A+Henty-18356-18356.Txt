father indeed walter 
told would like rate time see something world settling life easy matter say best 
ireland offers little field anyone ambition 
since king james came throne especially since tyrconnell became governor things little favourable us hopes yet justice done catholic population unhappy country 
monstrous colonel l estrange men hand rebellion king charles first still possession reign son lands taken father loyal king ireland 
descendants cromwell men lord homes faithful king charles 
certainly seems sir colonel l estrange said politician 
simply soldier obey orders seem cruel injustice great portion lands country held descendants cromwell soldiers lawful owners whose fault loyal king still dispossessed 
think better times coming mr davenant said 
doubt king leaning towards religion 
restrained carrying goodwill towards us effect privy councillors english party whose interest prevent change made constantly misrepresent feelings country 
days strongbow first landed island prey adventurers whose object wrest land native population 
descendant one early english settlers mr davenant 
true enough mr davenant said smiling doubt bad rest see held land centuries like descendants strongbow men come look matters irish point view rather english

said soldier politician 
ancestors royalists great love dutch stadtholder supported england class rose king charles

third utterly selfish unprincipled 
fourth gloomy bigot 
charles james pensioner france 
men ready sacrifice everything race way look ireland mr davenant said 
wars waged various pretences 
someone goaded rebellion false charges preferred wholesale religious pretext know bottom simply greed english adventurers irish land content dispossessed ancient owners three fourths cultivated land country want remainder pretence descendants early settlers sympathy irish neighbors marked us destruction already great portion estates hands cromwell men 
gross abuses commission king appointed inquire seizure estates ventured sit one day proofs brought forward overwhelmingly strong seen inquiry continue would made manifest world justice could satisfied nothing less clear sweep men seized estates 
ireland rises favor king james love stuarts recover land illegally wrested us dutch william whig adherents gain upper hand taken us forever 
religious element course count much 
already suffered persecution religion whigs could way would stamp utterly fire sword 
things looked better last five six years done since cromwell first put foot ireland 
begun hope justice 
tyrconnell stood us goodwill james gained many concessions 
never irish army 
land thieves fairly alarmed seen long delayed justice done us last 
many sold back lands original owners left country

well must hope come colonel l estrange said 
ready fight battles england continent civil war horrors sickens civil war like civil war england 
race animosities memory cruel wrongs one side

chapter dundalk 
failure derry utmost confusion prevailed military councils arising chiefly jealousies conflicting authorities french irish commanders 
james entirely control french ambassador together countrymen ireland affected despise irish rude uncivilized people irish turn hated french arrogance insolence 
many irish gentlemen raised regiments private expense superseded make room frenchmen appointed influence french ambassador 
gentlemen returned home disgust soon followed men equally discontented handed command foreigners instead native leaders 
every day breach widened french irish discontent caused king exactions wide general william time offered favourable terms catholics probable arrangement could arrived 
william busily work preparing army conquest country 
ireland stood alone probable england would rate time suffered go way close alliance france fact french influence powerful james rendered impossible england submit establishment would foreign hostile power close shores 
besides ireland remained dominion james power william throne england could never consolidated 
although met resistance assumption throne hearty support mere fraction english people accession work great whig families 
rule means popular dutch favorites much disliked england james french adherents ireland 
scotland jacobite party numerous powerful open rebellion authority 
thus william position throne england consolidated necessary blow struck ireland 
torn dissension without plan leading irish army remained months inactive regiments northern campaign returned districts raised thus preparation made meet army preparing invade country 
ten thousand strong command general schomberg although eighty years age still able active spirited commander embarked th august chester th landed near bangor carrickfergus bay 
force sufficient strength oppose 
schomberg found antrim belfast deserted garrison carrickfergus consisting two regiments prepared vigorously siege 
schomberg prepared invest short time attacked land sea 
siege pressed vigor garrison carty moore defended greatest skill bravery 
fast breaches battered walls repaired repulsed every attempt besiegers gain footing town 
garrison badly supplied ammunition stripped lead roofs castle church make bullets 
time attempt whatever made relieve 
french irish generals disputing best plan campaign 
king busy making money trade france holding burned last grain powder gallant garrison forced capitulate 
schomberg glad get place insist hard terms garrison marched honors war drums beating matches alight conveyed stores arms public private property nearest irish post 
effect determined resistance part little garrison carrickfergus impress schomberg fact difficulty task undertaken vastly greater supposed 
success londonderry defended irish army impressed idea levies king james simply contemptible fighting qualities garrison carrickfergus shown foe means despised convinced force command altogether inadequate necessities 
therefore moved south extreme caution 
found country altogether wasted deserted 
protestants long since fled gathered round derry enniskillen 
catholics deserted homes approach troops retreat burned wasted everything means subsistence army obliged rely upon fleet ordered follow coast 
schomberg soon joined three regiments enniskillen horse 
appearance troops astonished english 
resembled rather horde italian banditti body european cavalry 
observed little order military movements uniformity dress accoutrement 
man armed clad according fancy accompanied mounted servant carrying baggage 
like cossacks closely resembled distinguished extreme rapidity movement fierceness contempt difficulty danger 
calculated neither chances numbers rushed attack foe ferocity fanaticism almost ensured success regarded slaughter papist acceptable service lord 
plundered wherever went scourge irish protestants well catholics 
troops furnished derry similar character enniskillen 
could endure restraints discipline little use acting regular army like cossacks formidable acting 
schomberg successor indeed whole english officers soon came abhor savage undisciplined allies 
still irish army made move 
report magnified schomberg strength twice real numbers military leaders could believe many months preparation william despatched small army conquest ireland 
confusion dismay reigned dublin 
french marshal de rosen advised dublin drogheda abandoned irish army concentrated athlone limerick tyrconnell went drogheda council war sitting strenuously opposed promising next night twenty thousand men assembled 
expresses sent directions forced marches irish troops stationed munster directed course drogheda high spirits anxious meet enemy 
schomberg although reinforced six thousand men england fell back news gathering formed intrenched camp strong position dundalk sea 
approaches covered mountains rivers morasses communication open sea resolved wait reinforcements 
captain davenant became despondent cause embarked 
without king without french allies said bitterly wife might hope success enough ruin cause 
king object excite discontent disgust among subjects could act otherwise 
whole thoughts devoted wringing money people time spare spent upon superintending building nunneries interested 
french paralyse military operations 
regard us inferior race act five six thousand troops could defeat power england 
heartbreaking seeing chances wasted 
advantage taken enthusiasm excited king james landed wise prudent disinterested desirous obtaining affections classes brought none french adventurers would long ere undisputed king ireland end end stood one people arms ready oppose force england could send us 
never chances frittered away never succession blunders folly 
enough break one heart 
hope father troop marches take cornet 
six months older learned lot last campaign 
filled place cornet driscoll 
think killed last fight derry would appointed 
respects less inclined ever walter captain davenant said begin regard success hopeless 
make difference father way beaten sure hand land protestants 
besides things may turn better think whether certainly like best ireland 
well think captain davenant said walter satisfied felt sure father would finally accede wishes 
late night mounted messenger dashed door castle handed order 
captain davenant opened

bray captain davenant found rest troop drawn readiness brief inspection see present proper arms accoutrements started dublin hours rest continued way towards drogheda 
army proceeded north dundalk bitter disappointment troops arriving found schomberg instead advancing give battle shut intrenchments formed could induced sally 
vain king james accompanied army formed order battle within sight invaders lines 
schomberg tempted position appeared strong attacked irish forced endeavor reduce slow process starvation 
english army soon reduced pitiable straits hunger able obtain food ships disease 
situation camp low unhealthy 
fever broke swept away vast numbers men 
dutch enniskilleners suffered comparatively little accustomed damp climate 
english troops nearly eight thousand died two months blockade lasted 
james maintained position whole army schomberg must perished unfortunately cause insisted personally conducting operations complete success grasp marched army away middle november winter quarters thereby allowing schomberg move eight thousand men remained pest stricken camp healthier quarters 
disgust james officers understood anything war termination campaign extreme 
men indeed eager return homes would gladly attempted assault english camp defenders reduced half original strength survivors weakened disease attack would probably successful 
james several times point ordering attack vacillation character heightened conflicting counsels generals seemed bent thwarting gaining cause fought 
cavalry idle blockade schomberg camp continued frequently making excursions country bring cattle army villagers part deserted homes herds cattle grazing without masters 
one day captain davenant troop ridden thirty miles camp halted night village

walter return glad find friend john whitefoot made way home derry pleasant intercourse renewed 
schomberg army moved healthy quarters bountifully supplied kinds food necessaries england speedily recovered health discipline short time condition take field 
early february brigadier wolseley detachment enniskilleners english marched cavan 
james longer army could oppose schomberg enterprises 
latter recovering effects heavy losses nothing done put irish army condition take field

nevertheless duke berwick marched eight hundred men dublin brigadier nugent like force west meath longford arrived cavan hours english reached town 
irish force composed entirely infantry exception two troops cavalry 
english force consisted seven hundred foot three hundred cavalry 
cavan offer advantages way defense duke berwick moved army open field 
english lined hedges stood defensive 
irish horse commenced battle furious charge enniskilleners dragoons drove field english infantry maintained position stoutly prolonged fight irish retreated fort near town 
english enniskilleners entered cavan began plunder place

son succor boy extremity matter shall deem quits 
irish army moved forward boyne william approaching north 
james officers endeavored dissuade setting everything hazard battle 
represented army though quite unequal contest rapidly improving skill confidence reinforcements every day expected france would least make equal enemy numbers want arms artillery stores might expected also france short period policy clearly protract war wear enemy contest posts sieges 
unskilled troops might field proved steady resolute defense fortified places 
held great fortresses kingdom would easy provide defense occupy william army small affairs till winter climate would execution upon invaders irish would suffer little 
would time fight

french fleet every day expected coast england william would soon compelled return country recall greater part army 
scotland french busy materials country creating powerful diversion 
fight would forego every advantage meet views william whose obvious interest bring contest immediate decision every circumstance favor

evening called council war 
duke schomberg strongly opposed attack upon enemy posted strong position urged making turning movement marching straight upon dublin enemy would obliged fall back fight less advantageous circumstances 
king relying upon superior numbers discipline veteran troops determined attack knowing important bring matter decision early possible 
schomberg urged necessity occupying pass slane upon boyne considerably west irish line would thus cut retreat event victory render defeat decided one king saw require whole force dislodge irish position useless occupy pass slane small detachment would overwhelmed retiring irish

chapter boyne water 
morning tuesday st july broke calm bright 
six clock morning english right wing general douglas count schomberg marched towards slane 
consisted twenty four squadrons horse six battalions infantry 
marched along back river discovered several shallows crossed without proceeding far slane 
serious resistance offered passage boyne irish parties skirmishers fell back advanced 
forming troops order douglas schomberg advanced presently perceived french battalions great part irish cavalry forming left wing james army drawn order distance 
consequently halted sent reinforcements 
arrived extended lines right outflank enemy supporting cavalry alternate battalions infantry moved forward 
irish skirmishers fell back advance taking advantage banks ditches divided ground small fields keeping galling fire upon british advanced 
difficulty latter passed broken ground formed order battle edge appeared plain fact deep bog completely covered irish left 
came standstill 
william waited believed right would time fall upon irish left ordered center advance force passage old bridge 
dutch guards william relied upon best trustworthy troops advanced splendid order river side drums beating march 
reached water edge drums ceased soldiers entered river 
stream rose dense column marched dammed water reached shoulders grenadiers still moved regular order keeping arms ammunition dry holding heads 
opposite bank hedges near brink river lined skirmishers rear hollow covered little hills seven regiments irish infantry supported ten troops horse tyrconnell regiment cavalry drawn 
hills protected fire british batteries passed heads 
dutch troops continued way unmolested reached middle river hot fire opened upon irish skirmishers dutch moved unshaken soon gained opposite bank rapidly formed skirmishers retiring 
scarcely dutch formed squares irish horse burst upon full speed charged impetuosity 
stood charge unbroken irish horse charged upon greatest gallantry 
william pushed two regiments french huguenots one british across river assistance dutch guards ordered sir john hanmars count nassau regiment cross lower stream support 
supports making passage general hamilton advanced head body irish infantry water edge dashing river encountered french huguenot regiments middle stream 
desperate fight ensued french made way across hamilton falling back infantry opened right left permitting irish horse charge 
rushed fury upon french regiment colonel la callimot cut way right 
wheeling charged flank broke drove river 
la callimot killed regiment regained opposite bank 
meantime dutch guards reinforced advancing slowly irish infantry holding fast hedges brushwood contesting every inch ground wherever ground permitted irish horse burst upon evincing gallantry determination would done honor finest cavalry europe 
king continued make repeated efforts support dutch troops french broken pushed forward danish horse sooner crossed bank irish cavalry burst upon broke drove back river 
fled across stream disorder dispersed directions 
far success rested principally irish dutch guards alone remained unbroken center french infantry danish horse broken destroyed 
old duke schomberg exerted utmost restore battle point rallied french infantry advanced french cavalry towards river met irish horse returning pursuit danes 
old duke cut party routed moment walker clerical commander derry received mortal wound 
successful defense derry man gone london feted made much attached king william army posed high military authority although much discouraged king arrogance airs authority displeased 
center william forces getting worsted right douglas count schomberg inactive powerless leading left wing across river 
passage difficult one king extricated much exertion quicksand horse plunged 
irish oppose crossing soon forces across stream william ranged order 
consisted large body danish dutch enniskillen horse considerable force infantry 
soon order king though still suffering wound received day drew sword put head troops 
irish right wing consisted chiefly infantry moved forward meet perceiving numerous cavalry led king preparing take flank halted faced marched slowly little hill donore 
gained point faced round charged upon british followed closely 
moment irish cavalry moved rapidly center support right charged upon danish dutch horse led king sooner come contact danes dutch turned rode irish cavalry pursuit 
king rode towards enniskilleners 
colonel wolseley told men king asked wished follow 
replied shout king placing head rode towards irish infantry advanced met well directed volley much fond plundering slaughtering close fighting turned horse rode away 
king rallied infantry brought back fight irish infantry stood ground great steadiness hamilton general wounded taken charge cavalry 
fell back donore upon duleek good order enemy wanting molest rest irish infantry followed example 
singular battle boyne ever fought 
morning break day part james army artillery march pass slane actually retreat 
left wing composed chiefly french infantry supposed best troops army never fired shot 
center right composed entirely irish never battle alone engaged 
exception dutch guards william foreign troops repeatedly broken cavalry driven field irish horse division irish broken suffered decided defeat infantry hill donore compelled retreat perfect order 
throughout day irish cavalry showed vast superiority british even broke destroyed regiments infantry whole army fell back closed rear effectually prevented attempt pursuit 
thus battle boyne fought rather cover retreat defend position 
loss either side estimated five hundred general hamilton prisoner taken british 
honors fight certainly rested irish vastly superior force comprising best troops europe maintained throughout day gained indeed points decided advantage 
king james valor entirely evaporated first shot fired 
instead following william example leading troops conflict decide fate crown precipitated took position safe distance danger hill donore soon battle approached point rode duleek placed head french troops led retreat 
soon however rode ahead arrived dublin state consternation despair first fugitive field battle 
meantime army whole unbroken marching perfect order field battle king commander best ruin cause spreading dismay alarm throughout country 
next morning king sent mayor corporation dublin told necessity taking care recommended make best terms could enemy 
mounted made flight waterford ordering bridges broken behind although british army yet moved position boyne 
reaching waterford james embarked board ship ordered readiness sailed france 
conduct conduct alone converted battle boyne effect kind drawn battle great victory william 
indeed answered object irish commanders proposed 
plan accustom new badly armed levies stand firm steadiness experience william veteran troops withdraw without committing decisive combat view protracting campaign william forced leave ireland foreign army worn winter service uncongenial climate 
every day would calculated improve army weaken reduce enemy 
position boyne enabled try plan partial combat extent chose without danger forced extensive action deemed expedient 
irish troops greatly surpassed expectation officers filled william generals amazement probable large part infantry artillery sent early day experiment might turned brilliant victory 
william surprised alarmed resistance encountered remained days boyne without advancing 
told except duke schomberg resistance irish would contemptible forward scoffed courage irish enniskilleners day battle shown unmistakably white feather 
king disliked despised troops hung without ceremony taken acts plunder slaughter much addicted 
far flight king james discouraging army caused universal joy 
constant vacillation interference cowardly action paralysed troops felt free act without interference would able cope invaders 
william offered favourable terms ireland would submit authority declined partly owing powerful influence france partly fear terms would observed partly apprehension gentry lands recovered hands cromwell settlers would taken 
battle boyne walter davenant father troop taken part desperate charges upon enemy 
long hours battle lasted cavalry incessantly engaged 
time time charged upon dutch squares sooner ranks reformed recoiling line fixed bayonets called upon charge another direction 
walter heart beat high dashed midst french infantry shattered drove danish horse little time think looking back upon day seemed chaos excitement confusion could hardly recall even chief incidents 
troops halted night way dispirited result battle retreat begun blow struck 
knew neither intended hoped ground would successfully held every man felt pride thought eighteen thousand newly raised irish levies small portion infantry armed muskets sustained throughout long summer day attacks double number veteran troops supported fifty pieces artillery 
loss irish horse comparatively small 
charging square days bayonet fixed muzzle gun desperate undertaking hedge steel issues rolling continuous fire 
french regiment broken cut scarce resistance mercenary cavalry defeated greatest ease 
thus among brigade irish horse fallen friends mourn nothing mar pride every man felt behavior irish troops overwhelming odds 
king fled everyone knew feeling one relief 
absence victory us captain davenant said group officers sat fire made fence hastily pulled 
majesty virtues good counsellors would make worthy monarch among virtues military genius conspicuous 
glad lauzun french would also take departure let us mountcashel division back france

next evening walter heard news william troops yet moved boyne thought safe take direct road dublin 
laid aside uniform reaching home morning started civilian clothes uniform valise strapped behind saddle 
carried sword usual almost gentlemen time rode armed would therefore excite neither comment attention 
carried also brace pistols belt underneath coat 
arriving dublin found greatest uproar excitement prevailing

walter rode one village fray going 
party protestants riding boisterously along knocked woman child arms answered angry remonstrance peasants jeers laughter 
stones begun fly 
protestants drawn swords villagers caught hoes spades weapons fierce fight going

walter saw interference would avail heavy heart bitter hatred two parties ireland exhibited turned road made circuit round village continued way

following day pressed evening overtook retiring army 
arrival king william army dublin proclamation issued assuring save resisted authority protection threatening severity disturbed peace committed outrage personal property 
letters protection granted applied hearing jabez whitefoot went dublin apply protection family captain davenant 
hearing however persecution catholics would allowed army likely march west pursuit irish thought better leave matter alone application would draw attention authorities fact captain davenant son engaged hostile army 
felt sure ladies need fear molestation save soldiers northerners influence protestants neighborhood would suffice prevent interfering household castle 
irish army marched towards shannon concentrated part neighborhood athlone part limerick 
william shortly prepared follow 
divided army two columns 
main body command took road limerick division consisting five regiments cavalry twelve infantry despatched command general douglas purpose investing fortress athlone 
armies marched west path marked wholesale outrage destruction 
although protections granted peasants inhabitants towns villages armies marched entirely disregarded soldiers plundered ill used sometimes murdered defenceless people carrying away without payment provisions could lay hands 
king sometimes hanged caught acts plunder slaughter little effect 
dutch soldiers alone maintained order discipline 
foreign mercenaries composed part sweepings great cities behaved brutality cruelty almost without example acknowledged historians time protestant well catholic 
indeed protestant inhabitants suffered even catholics many latter fled approach army protestants regarding friends deliverers remained quietly home suffered every insult outrage hands horde savages perfectly indifferent religion plundered 
captain davenant troop force retired athlone awaited approach column general douglas 
reports conduct enemy brought flying peasants filled irish troops indignation rage arriving town general douglas sent messenger demand surrender colonel grace commanded replied firing pistol towards 
athlone stood either side shannon 
town eastern bank river called english town western irish distinction existing many irish towns early english settlers found expedient live apart irish mutual protection attack 
colonel grace retired west bank river strongly fortified destroying english town breaking part bridge across river 
garrison consisted three regiments foot nine troops horse douglas erected batteries opened fire castle replied briskly guns got better batteries 
strong detachment horse mounted grenadiers sent douglas lanesborough miles north town orders pass river point post held irish troops easily repulsed attempt 
next proposed pass river ford short distance bridge troops little heart enterprise ford covered field works erected irish 
assailants already reduced considerable straits 
consumed provisions found town plundering without mercy protestant inhabitants well treated irish troops conduct army effectually deterred country people bringing provisions 
circulation report general sarsfield fifteen thousand men march cut besiegers athlone determined general douglas make speedy retreat 
fear cut abandoned heavy baggage quitting high road made way unfrequented routes added hardships march 
retreat column accompanied unhappy protestant inhabitants feared remain behind lest irish retaliate upon sufferings inflicted upon countrymen 
meantime main english army done little 
dublin commission appointed examine forfeit lands catholics adherents king james set machine work king proceeded army southward carlow kilkenny waterford places surrendered garrisons allowed march arms baggage join main army shannon 
waterford king received serious news state things england determined return home

inquiry showed complaints well founded finding impossible restore order discipline among king sent regiments back england 
receiving better news home started rejoin army marched towards limerick joined way division douglas driven along cattle horses country passed 
limerick time second city ireland 
country long distance along mouth shannon much wooded immediate vicinity town surrounded thick inclosures houses orchards gardens plantations 
cultivated land everywhere divided small fields inclosed hedges intersected lanes 
east town shannon divides forming island part city situated 
called english town connected bridge called thomond bridge clare side river north south another bridge irish town county limerick side 
thomond bridge defended strong fort field works clare side city side drawbridge flanked towers city walls 
bridge long narrow 
position english town indeed almost impregnable 
built upon rock considerable extent land outside walls low marshy could time flooded 
shannon broad rapid 
irish town limerick shore strong defended ordinary walls 
captured however english town could still hold 
king made approaches city slowly obliged level numerous inclosures moved 
occupied irish infantry lining every hedge kept galling fire falling back gradually heavy bodies troops brought reached cover guns city fort 
upon opening fire william army halted encamped irish town 
boyne king narrow escape cannonball walls striking ground foot passing gap hedge 
king learned great dissensions existed irish french relied upon much upon strength arms obtain possession city 
information indeed correct 
king james flight left orders assume supreme command 
duke berwick considerable claims 
lauzun french officers declined altogether receive orders tyrconnell irish officers equally objected act command frenchman 
consequently whole siege main irish army acting upon william rear could speedily made position untenable remained inactive 
monsieur boileau french officer governor town lauzun examined fortifications pronounced place wholly incapable defense declaring walls could knocked roasted apples ordered entire french division march galway await opportunity embarking france leaving irish defend city chose 
lauzun fact courtier soldier 
desired get back versailles hazard inspired officers men sentiments general cry among recalled france 
indeed interest cause fought 
looked contempt half armed half trained allies grumbled continually hardships undergo 
indeed evil day king james cause exchanged mountcashel fine division useless allies throughout war service cause endless dissension disaster 
soon king william taken position front limerick sent summons boileau surrender 
latter consulted tyrconnell sarsfield officers even last moment question whether place defended 
last however decision made 
reply addressed william secretary sir robert roultwell boileau could acknowledge prince king polite hurt feelings denial royal title

would like see command father care much walter one man 
rather soldier might take random army possessed fair share common sense chaos prevails course man would rather sarsfield 
whether great general means knowing never yet slightest opportunity showing think made chances save one dash artillery convoy 
done nothing cavalry command could chose snap fingers pretensions french act independently think might done far done 
still prominent leader possesses confidence irish classes 
supreme command would sure complete change tactics 
instead waiting everywhere attacked take offensive even unable meet william forces pitched battles believe perfectly capable able harass exhaust point william would glad grant us terms might demand bring war end

chapter dangerous mission 
walter captain davenant said son one day returned council taken part quarters general sarsfield mission dublin 
necessary first place communicate friends second ascertain far plans enemy next campaign 
us would readily recognized dublin therefore seemed difficulty selecting someone undertake duty said thought would likely succeed better 
time dublin question whether single person would likely recognize 
course disguise youth favor 
say danger undertaking think risk greater frequently run

thus although peasants aware general details fighting taken place knew nothing part various regiments borne 
reading writing rare accomplishments post altogether interrupted many remained suspense beginning end war fate left take part 
friends make long journeys walter unaccustomed walk barefooted feet first sore tender time reached dublin hardened able stride along side larry started war never pair shoes life

saint ruth convinced athlone could taken spent greater portion time entertaining ladies gentry neighborhood balls fetes fell trap contrary opinion advice irish generals recalled town regiments marched morning replaced three battalions inferior troops 
irish officers remonstrated warmly saint ruth show disdain opinions invited large party ladies gentlemen entertainment evening 
night british army prepared attack 
commanders respective divisions led troops person 
garrison town asleep 
saint ruth camp festivities general officers retired 
irish sentinels noted movement british camp supposed mustering retreat thus three british columns drew inside town wall readiness advance without notion purpose entertained opposite side river 
one column headed sixty chosen men complete armor cross bridge throw platform arch another cross ford third pontoon bridge 
church bell tolled six three columns advanced simultaneously irish thoroughly awake leading battalions forded river platform place troops pouring town 
guns hastily discharged men three irish regiments town fled haste avoid capture columns pouring across river ford pontoon bridge 
many indeed captured whilst asleep 
saint ruth roused sleep sound cannon ordered troops arms late 
town rather ruins possession british brilliant success valor determination irish troops forfeited carelessness folly self confidence french general 
listened advice irish officers attempt like preceded must failed case nothing remained ginckle precipitous retreat dublin loss whole advantages gained previous campaign necessity bringing war end concession rights privileges irish catholics landowners 
whole course history changed folly one man 
ginckle taken athlone vast cost life ever impressed magnitude task subduing ireland long people driven desperation threatened confiscation lands persecution religion 
king william anxious ever termination hostilities day news fall athlone reached issued proclamation offering protection security possessions continuance offices held james would lay arms three weeks time 
issue proclamation year would satisfied irish put stop war late 
promises made broken irish much reason fear opposition ceased council train greedy adherents would obtain ascendency would continue work spoliation robbery 
moreover irish army feel way beaten 
fault second siege athlone terminated former siege limerick done ginckle army hurrying back defeated disorganized dublin 
felt battle boyne suffered defeat although accordance general plan fallen back eagerly desired fight one battle prove open field match mercenaries king william 
council lords justices aghast proclamation threatened destroy hopes dividing among friends lands catholics ireland best prevent acceptance spreading rumors mere bait promises would fulfilled saint ruth french officers best also set irish 
saint ruth really good officer conscious far gained credit expected command ireland misfortunes happened entirely attributed longed opportunity wiping slur military reputation 
therefore urged upon irish generals ginckle indeed gained little hopes william rested upon army alone defeat could demand obtain terms liked lay besides able assure advices france louis making preparations assisting vastly larger scale previously done 
thus combination circumstances proclamation elicited response 
siege athlone carried main body sarsfield cavalry remained part camp near town commanders small bodies men like corps captain davenant regarded irregulars liberty action 
made long raids east often spread confusion dismay among enemy appearing suddenly irish troops believed within hundred miles 
went joined peasants keeping desultory fighting neighborhood cork harassing english whenever moved one point another sent parties collect forage provisions 
captain davenant respectfully urged upon sarsfield immense benefit would result whole irish cavalry place upon line enemy communication finding irish general unmoved arguments several times endeavored carry ideas far could done small force 
inactivity irish horse throughout long sieges athlone limerick except upon occasion raid upon siege train almost inexplicable 
nothing fear enemy cavalry proved immensely superior whenever met war power months cut british communications oblige either detach large force keep roads open would unable push siege would indeed danger attacked destroyed irish infantry raise siege fall back upon bases dublin waterford 
possible explanations offered first sarsfield although dashing commander action possessed military genius whatever second prevented moving jealousy french commanders chief wish see credit compelling enemy fall back monopolized irish cavalry third sarsfield saw advantages could obtained throwing cavalry rear enemy deliberately remained inactive rather leave french generals act unchecked presence headquarters 
never decided alternatives due irish cavalry remained long time inactive william ginckle permitted unmolested save detached bodies horse maintain long line communications base unchecked

british column edge bog advanced ginckle pushed several fresh battalions across morass center irish infantry fell back disputing every inch ground 
cavalry still without orders strangely enough one assumed command death saint ruth 
night came retreat irish infantry became rout cavalry halted summit kilcomeden covered retreat 
extraordinary circumstance irish army left without orders death saint ruth never explained 
command devolved upon sarsfield none accounts battle speak present 
certainly consulted saint ruth present council war battle bad feeling existed saint ruth since general arrived broken open dispute since fall athlone 
inexplicable second command one come forward give orders death general victorious army left flock sheep without shepherd

subsequent struggle irish fighting man without order object slaughtered vast numbers loss estimated british writers seven thousand men number points wholesale slaughter rather loss could inflicted upon brave army little hour daylight 
crushing defeat irish victory far inspiring william army confidence felt outset war 
athlone almost miracle saved english terrible disaster 
irish proved fully match best soldiers william could send although infantry suffered terribly rout ranks would speedily filled cavalry arm irish uniformly proved superiority moved away field battle intact unbroken 
athlone aughrim therefore rendered william general anxious ever bring struggle end force arms offering every concession irish 
imminence peril cowed even party confiscation offered opposition issue ginckle proclamations renewing offers william 
ginckle moved forward immediately battle granted liberal terms garrisons various small posts came upon

king william absent continent anxious aid army warring ireland queen advisers considering war virtually ordered transports ireland take board ten thousand men ginckle allowed month delay 
means sanguine position 
irish army still numerous british discouraged defeat aughrim considered rightly victory snatched grasp accident 
ginckle relied rather upon concession force 
irish divided two parties one earnestly desired peace could obtain fair terms insisted british could trusted keep terms might make 
sarsfield head war party succeeded present preventing arrangement

ginckle occupied ground william army taken first siege directed attacks chiefly upon english town 
irish communication open county clare seventeen regiments irish horse encamped clare side river 
ginckle pushed works great vigor duty trenches severe cavalry compelled take turn infantry notwithstanding siege artillery much powerful william disposal little progress made 
town set fire several times flames speedily extinguished inhabitants left city erected tents clare side protection cavalry little harm done 
siege going number desultory engagements took place different parts country protestant militia lately raised bands rapparees varying success

ginckle becoming straitened provisions proclamations issued failed inspire peasantry confidence 
erected battery thirty five guns king island incessant cannonade days breach effected wall abbey ballsbridge 
preparations made crossing arm shannon assaulting breach works constructed crossing river repeatedly destroyed irish idea assault upon breach length abandoned 
desperate ginckle think position issued orders repair fortifications kilmallock intending raise siege establish winter quarters postponed taking step days would bring almost certain disaster upon army 
french fleet expected arrive shortly irish reinforced men arms supplies every kind would probably resume offensive winter would find cut supplies assistance 
determined therefore make one effort retiring 
throughout siege communication several irish officers high rank especially general clifford commanded cavalry posted river opposite camp 
officers desirous bringing war end foresaw arrival french succeeded driving english country ireland would simply become dependency france preferred english connection 
ginckle determined try feint succeeded athlone 
workmen kept busy repairing works kilmallock preparing place reception army

general ginckle walter said warmly hitherto foul excesses troops brought disgrace upon rather brutal order carried name held infamous stand next cromwell curses irishmen heap upon memory

ginckle exclaimed face purple passion 
sir general hamilton said tell half hour present time march camp head division british troops return dublin fight way camp opposition offered explain conduct king british parliament 
enough disgrace already brought upon connected army doings foreign troops comes death torture prisoners order general time every british officer refuse permit foul disgrace rest upon name 
chorus assent english officers ginckle foreign officers gathered round looked moment swords would drawn

tell punishment contrary english law 
enough 
abandon 
prisoners shall hung quartered 
presume objection offer 
general matter competence conscience hamilton said 
men simply understand defended property marauders conceive worthy punishment whatever 
choose sentence punishment sentence mine 
thought policy heal breach two parties 
seems mistaken 
personally protest execution sentence beyond called upon go 
act injustice cruelty performed general upon prisoners would justify soldier imperilling success campaign resisting orders superior therefore duty king renders unable act solemnly protest name english officers command sentence consider unjust extreme 
saying general hamilton english officers left general tent 
hoped protest would effect preventing barbarous sentence carried execution mistaken 
fact carry first intention would absolutely unlawful caused ginckle abandon made obstinate carrying second execution 
english officers stood talking far tent tones indignation disgust brutal sentence walked towards divisional camp 
went saw number men standing round tree 
hessian soldiers much brutal laughter reeving ropes arm tree officers came along six struggling forms drawn high heads crowd

general hamilton others pressed forward 
colonel hanau general said hessian officer surely going hang young officer general never included others general orders precise hessian said coldly 
twelve peasants one officer hung afterwards quartered

walter resigned fate stood watching altercation renewed feeling hope

hessian colonel called upon men seize prisoner cut interfered prevent general orders carried 
hesitated resolute aspect english crowd foreign soldiers ranged attack commence number english soldiers seen running musket hand camp 
hessian colonel saw attempt carry orders would bring something like pitched battle therefore waved men back saying general hamilton nothing sir report general ginckle prevented force carrying orders effect 
course general hamilton said coldly 
shall perfectly prepared answer conduct 
goodwill english foreign sections ginckle army general hamilton trouble preventing soldiers attacking hessians inducing retire camp 
soon arrived ordered drums beaten whole division get arms 
despatched officer general ginckle narrating circumstances saying honor whole army concerned preventing officer fairly taken prisoner war acting spy injured indeed policy well honor forbade course taken several officers rank hands irish would naturally retaliate execution prisoners war 
made formal complaint colonel hanau refusing delay execution could lay matter general 
conduct matter said perfectly prepared defend military court court must held england purposed return division majesty intrusted command 
dutch general long received letter informed taken place also learned english division struck tents drawn arms 
allow depart would entail certain ruin upon campaign felt probable course hamilton officers taken would upheld military court england public opinion would condemn execution officer taken fair fight 
therefore wrote letter general hamilton saying regretted find acting misapprehension understood person claiming irish officer fact spy severely reprimanded colonel hanau refusal delay execution fact explained 
far feeling way aggrieved general hamilton interfered prevent mistake taking place felt much obliged done execution irish officer taken war would every way unfortunate circumstance 
general hamilton showed letter colonels various regiments division agreed general ginckle evidently desirous matter go would well order tents pitched troops resume ordinary duties 
dear walter colonel l estrange said happy indeed came 
felt afterwards learned saved life murdered execution would neither less murder twelve poor fellows taken kilcowan brutal murder perfectly justified defending property idea quartering well hanging traitors worst dye nothing short monstrous 
came regiment month since heartily sick see going 
terrible see ruined villages road dublin 
seen fighting continent nothing equal wholesale brutality war conducted 
god continue give success army behaves one done altogether beyond 
one thing resolved whether take limerick see small chance shall exchange possible regiment serving flanders 
shall resign commission 
father rode dublin see mother glad find old mrs davenant well 
glad find owing influence mr conyers troubled fortunately able bring influence bear upon council seem bent upon squeezing last drop blood irish veins 
men falling must put head regiment 
hand care officer march course go us 
men dismissed colonel l estrange rejoined walter 
ginckle thought better said 
fancied would venture push matters loss one division really rely upon would fatal hope success campaign 
ginckle passionate man fool must seen matter laid king conduct would approved 
say right military sense sure public opinion would approved 
tales circulated doings army since commencement war already roused strong feeling irritation throughout country 
colonel l estrange took walter general hamilton tent formally introducing told story wreck rescue walter certain death 
mean l estrange general hamilton asked 
intention unless see objection pass lines evening 
provide good horse see well away 
happened ginckle say feel obliged thus rendering service getting rid prisoner 
likely questions asked remarks made afterwards 
without influence court strong section bitterly opposed dutchmen placed every post king gift would difficulty getting hostile feeling ginckle relation affair would cost command 
yes general agreed 
marlborough would glad take matter ginckle must pretty well aware want success must already made position precarious think trouble ask questions prisoner certainly william thank means unjust arbitrary conduct causing split english foreign troops 
like put heads one noose feel compunction setting swinging greater set rascals never collected sun 
must say contrast army irish great although many bloody deeds performed rapparees never single complaint brought irish troops 
anyhow mr davenant think better fall colonel l estrange plan 
difficulty getting indeed send troop cavalry see well beyond lines 
walter spent rest day colonel l estrange told taken place since last met 
difficult believe three years ago said finished 
judge flight time incidents crowd 
uneventful days pass unheeded 
seems yesterday stood deck ship knew sure go pieces chance anyone reaching rocky coast alive small indeed saw seemed little black speck approaching fisher boy made way wave 
way well hope might done well liked

larry first delighted thought day boat boat larger shore accompanied father larry insisted going 
time enough buy boat war said 
glad father object larry way ever since 
enrolled troop thinks chance fighting takes place ranks times acts servant 
tell forgotten colonel l estrange said 
much quiet time 
could got regiment cared disliked thought fighting 
much like civil war 
six months ago things going badly us continent asked employed given regiment raising 
got fair order expecting ordered embark low country moment news came ginckle heavy losses athlone aughrim orders came us proceed bristol take ship ireland 
half thought throwing commission news scandalous conduct foreign soldiers stirred every english heart disgust indignation thought struggle nearly 
william anxious peace price would grant almost terms secure hand knew louis last going make great effort 
certain either irish would make peace fair terms winter french would land would end prospect conquering ireland matters settled continent william could devote whole strength business 
alternative think likely walter asked 
latter colonel l estrange said gravely 
frankly walter situation looks bad 
far see chance whatever taking limerick fortnight ten thousand french troops landed 
course probable last moment irish may conclude prefer england rather france comes 
hope sense choose england hear true judge insolent arrogance french officers fraction force would regarded masters 
william ready grant religious equality security persons estates 
think irish unwise refuse 
time suffered villainous treatment hands william soldiers blame decide throw lot france 
think walter said sure promises would kept greater part would favor making peace 
nine ten us english descent driven take arms cruel oppression suffered 
present five sixths soil ireland hands protestants religion persecuted years trampled regarded fair objects robbery 
say true walter one regret 
still think would worse france england 
louis would drain island men fill army 
uses cat paw struggle england holland would hesitate turn england time suit make peace terms offer ireland exchange piece territory coveted beyond frontier 
know father much opinion walter said confidence whatever king france considers french interference responsible want success attended us 
rate scarcely one us hate french certainly choose two countries choose england
