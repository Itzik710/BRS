randall byrne sat sentinel post hands folded grave eyes steadily fixed hour hour move 
though wind rose whistled upper chambers mourned empty halls randall byrne stir much eyelash observance 
two things held fascinated 
one girl passed yonder stairs wearily without single backward glance silent battle went adjoining room 
imagination wandered away secondary pictures 
would see barry meeting buck daniels last striking remorselessly hound strikes hare would see riding back towards elkhead catch bright sad vision kate cumberland waving careless adieu hear singing carelessly turned away 
pictures however came rarely mind byrne 
mostly thought stranger leaning body old joe cumberland reviving storing electric energy paying back ancient debt 
thought girl turned landing place stairs head fallen thought lying bed arm mass bright hair trying sleep tired remorsely held awake power bringing joe cumberland back verge death 
impossible 
thing could 
really bad yarn frankenstein monster 
considered would seem print backed solemn asseverations saw faces men associated pale thoughtful faces striving conceal smiles contempt 
always came back like desperate hare doubling course upon picture kate cumberland turning stairs bent bright head confessed defeat 
man forgotten 
made byrne open eyes incredulity even imagine thing 
man forgotten withered hag might ride past road 
ear subconsciously attentive everything around caught faint sound next room 
regular noise 
rhythm quick footfall nature like sound heavily beating pulse 
randall byrne sat chair 
faint creaking attested indeed footfall traversing room fro steadily 
stranger longer leaned couch old cattleman 
walking floor characteristic softly padding step 
think walked carried byrne automatically darkest night wind face rhythm long striding horse carrying destination unknown 
heard soft scratching repeated door 
came rose opened door tall shaggy dog slipped opening glided past 
startled byrne oddly see animal stealing away barry leaving 
called beast met silent baring white fangs stopped tracks 
great dog gone without sound byrne closed door without casting look inside 
stupidly foolishly afraid look within 
silence vital meaning 
pictures crowded brain

unequal battle however one animals hardened veteran scarred many battle range young three year old body half strong heart 
short time sustained weight larger bull eventually knees buckled dropped heavily earth 
older bull drew back little charged

charged squarely horns would buried head striking angle one touched target delivered long ripping blow 
blood streaming side wounded bull made group cows victor pursued closely length turned tail leaped low fence corral new one hastily built occasion 
conqueror raised head inside fence bellowed triumph outside fence commenced pawing sand switching tail across bleeding side turning little red eyes

chapter xxxiii doctor byrne shows truth day low lying mists day dull shadow cast tree house man graver place room old joe cumberland even lamp light merciful room left corners big apartment obscurity meager daylight stripped away illusion left room naked ugly 
colors wall carpet brighter spring showed faded lifeless foliage dead days late november leaves life except keeps clinging twig fallen fellows lifted rustled ground every faint wind sound like breathing forest 
like autumn face joe cumberland color neither flushed pale dull sallow foretells death 
beside bed sat doctor randall byrne kept pressure two fingers upon wrist rancher 
removed thermometer lips cumberland old man spoke without lifting closed eyelids even effort could accomplish great concentration 
fever day doc feel little better asked byrne 
feelin 
hot jest sort middlin cold 
doctor byrne glanced thermometer frown shook mercury 
admitted fever 
joe cumberland opened eyes trifle peered byrne 
satisfied doc doctor randall byrne merciless modern school believes acquainting patient truth 
said

feelin sort weak since seen dan last night admitted 
news kate brought bring kept lad think thinking answered doctor coldly 
last interview nearly killed 
see shall wash hands case 
first came felt better fact admit seemed better body mind 
thing could last 
false stimulus first effects passed away left condition 
mr cumberland must see joe cumberland laughed long softly 
life murmured worth much half advise said doctor reserved

bit peeved doc queried old man 
well sir know much longer 
lord man feel going like flame lamp oil runs

listen reached long large knuckled claw like hand drew doctor eyes earnest got live till see em standin beside hand hand doc doctor even dim light changed color 
passed hand slowly across forehead 
expect see expect nothin 
hope bitterness byrne heart came throat 
oddly suited match said marry 
marry 
ha cried cumberland starting bed braced quaking elbow 
lie ordered doctor pressed ranchman back pillows 
mean would long story scientific explanation 
doc dan concerned got patience job 
brief prove mystery daniel barry 
doc man guessing 
start primitive times said doctor randall byrne man nearly related call lower animals 
days could surround artificial protective environment 
depended unassisted strength body 
muscular sensuous development therefore far advance modern man 
modern man used mind expense body 
quality muscles altered senses sight hearing instance much blunted 
primitive days ear kept guard man even slept terror thousand deadly enemies stronger eye keenly attuned probe shadows forest lurking foes 
sir biology thing known sport 
heard living organisms undergo gradual processes change 
season season year year environment affects individual yet gradual changes extremely slow 
steps noticeable change elapse periods many times longer life historic man 
speed changes comes call sports 
particular plant instance gradually tends fewer leaves thicker bark change slight age age suddenly single instance occurs plant realizes suddenly single step ideal towards species striving 
word leaves extraordinarily thick bark 
particular instance one species orange tended fewer seeds 
finally came orange tree whose fruit seeds 
origin navel orange 
typical sport 
reverse sport 
instead jumping long distance ahead individual may lapse back towards primitive 
individual called atavism 
instance mountain desert several generations pressure environment calling species man able live comparative comfort waste region man word equipped powerful organisms much home heart desert ordinary man would drawing room 
gather drift argument 
observed man barry carefully 
thoroughly convinced atavism 
among men seems strange 
different therefore seems mysterious 
matter fact quite common freak 
could name others like differing common men though differing exactly manner 
see result daniel barry man desert necessary made desert
