following canyon line saw rim broken intersecting canyons farther red walls yellow cliffs leading toward deep blue cleft made sure deception pass 
walking rods promontory found trail went 
descent gradual along stone walled trail venters felt sure place oldring drove cattle pass 
however indication ever driven cattle point 
oldring many holes burrow 
searching round little hollows venters much relief found water 
composed rest eat bread meat waited sufficient time elapse could safely give horses drink 
judged hour somewhere around noon 
wrangle lay rest night followed suit 
long venters intended make move 
longer rested better safer would give water 
forced go black star lay expecting find dead 
instead found racer partially wholly recovered 
recognition even fire big black eyes 
venters overjoyed

black star presently labored feet heave groan shook snorted water 
venters repaired little pool found filled sombrero gave racer drink 
black star gulped one draught drop pushed nose hat snorted 
venters led night drink time black star also 
blacks began graze 
sorrel wandered sage trail canyon
