however many particulars inducing believe average rate traveling might possibly much exceed thirty miles per hour considerations fail make deep impression upon mind mention fully hereafter 
next point regarded matter far greater importance 
indications afforded barometer find ascensions surface earth height feet left us one thirtieth entire mass atmospheric air ascended nearly one third far elevation cotopaxi surmounted one half material events one half ponderable body air incumbent upon globe 
also calculated altitude exceeding hundredth part earth diameter exceeding eighty miles rarefaction would excessive animal life could manner sustained moreover delicate means possess ascertaining presence atmosphere would inadequate assure us existence

reasoning data must course simply analogical 
greatest height ever reached man feet attained aeronautic expedition messieurs gay lussac biot 
moderate altitude even compared eighty miles question could help thinking subject admitted room doubt great latitude speculation 
point fact ascension made given altitude ponderable quantity air surmounted farther ascension means proportion additional height ascended may plainly seen stated ratio constantly decreasing 
therefore evident ascend high may literally speaking arrive limit beyond atmosphere found 
must exist argued although may exist state infinite rarefaction 
hand aware arguments wanting prove existence real definite limit atmosphere beyond absolutely air whatsoever 
circumstance left view contend limit seemed although positive refutation creed still point worthy serious investigation

rash pursuit object rushes mere assumption outset 
folly suppose says murder murder committed body could consummated soon enough enabled murderers throw body river midnight 
demand naturally folly suppose murder committed within five minutes girl quitting mother house folly suppose murder committed given period day assassinations hours 
murder taken place moment nine clock morning sunday quarter midnight would still time enough throw body river midnight 
assumption amounts precisely murder committed sunday allow l etoile assume may permit liberties whatever 
paragraph beginning folly suppose murder etc however appears printed l etoile may imagined existed actually thus brain inditer folly suppose murder murder committed body could committed soon enough enabled murderers throw body river midnight folly say suppose suppose time resolved suppose body thrown midnight sentence sufficiently inconsequential utterly preposterous one printed

sentence question one meaning stands meaning fairly stated material go behind mere words idea words obviously intended failed convey 
design journalist say whatever period day night sunday murder committed improbable assassins would ventured bear corpse river midnight 
herein lies really assumption complain

assassination might taken place upon river brink river thus throwing corpse water might resorted period day night obvious immediate mode disposal

even cannon fired corpse rises least five six days immersion sinks let alone 
assertions tacitly received every paper paris exception le moniteur 
latter print endeavors combat portion paragraph reference drowned bodies citing five six instances bodies individuals known drowned found floating lapse less time insisted upon l etoile 
something excessively unphilosophical attempt part le moniteur rebut general assertion l etoile citation particular instances militating assertion 
possible adduce fifty instead five examples bodies found floating end two three days fifty examples could still properly regarded exceptions l etoile rule time rule confuted 
admitting rule le moniteur deny insisting merely upon exceptions argument l etoile suffered remain full force argument pretend involve question probability body risen surface less three days probability favor l etoile position instances childishly adduced shall sufficient number establish antagonistical rule 
see argument upon head urged rule end must examine rationale rule 
human body general neither much lighter much heavier water seine say specific gravity human body natural condition equal bulk fresh water displaces 
bodies fat fleshy persons small bones women generally lighter lean large boned men specific gravity water river somewhat influenced presence tide sea 
leaving tide question may said human bodies sink even fresh water accord 
almost one falling river enabled float suffer specific gravity water fairly adduced comparison say suffer whole person immersed little exception possible 
proper position one swim upright position walker land head thrown fully back immersed mouth nostrils alone remaining surface 
thus circumstanced shall find float without difficulty without exertion 
evident however gravities body bulk water displaced nicely balanced trifle cause either preponderate 
arm instance uplifted water thus deprived support additional weight sufficient immerse whole head accidental aid smallest piece timber enable us elevate head look 
struggles one unused swimming arms invariably thrown upwards attempt made keep head usual perpendicular position 
result immersion mouth nostrils inception efforts breathe beneath surface water lungs 
much also received stomach whole body becomes heavier difference weight air originally distending cavities fluid fills 
difference sufficient cause body sink general rule insufficient cases individuals small bones abnormal quantity flaccid fatty matter 
individuals float even drowning 
corpse supposed bottom river remain means specific gravity becomes less bulk water displaces 
effect brought decomposition otherwise 
result decomposition generation gas distending cellular tissues cavities giving puffed appearance horrible 
distension far progressed bulk corpse materially increased without corresponding increase mass weight specific gravity becomes less water displaced forthwith makes appearance surface 
decomposition modified innumerable circumstances hastened retarded innumerable agencies example heat cold season mineral impregnation purity water depth shallowness currency stagnation temperament body infection freedom disease death 
thus evident assign period thing like accuracy corpse shall rise decomposition 
certain conditions result would brought within hour others might take place 
chemical infusions animal frame preserved forever corruption bi chloride mercury one 
apart decomposition may usually generation gas within stomach acetous fermentation vegetable matter within cavities causes sufficient induce distension bring body surface 
effect produced firing cannon simple vibration 
may either loosen corpse soft mud ooze imbedded thus permitting rise agencies already prepared may overcome tenacity putrescent portions cellular tissue allowing cavities distend influence gas 
thus us whole philosophy subject easily test assertions l etoile 
experience shows says paper drowned bodies bodies thrown water immediately death violence require six ten days sufficient decomposition take place bring top water 
even cannon fired corpse rises least five six days immersion sinks let alone 
whole paragraph must appear tissue inconsequence incoherence 
experience show drowned bodies require six ten days sufficient decomposition take place bring surface 
science experience show period rising necessarily must indeterminate 
moreover body risen surface firing cannon sink let alone decomposition far progressed permit escape generated gas 
wish call attention distinction made drowned bodies bodies thrown water immediately death violence 
although writer admits distinction yet includes category 
shown body drowning man becomes specifically heavier bulk water would sink except struggles elevates arms surface gasps breath beneath surface gasps supply water place original air lungs 
struggles gasps would occur body thrown water immediately death violence 
thus latter instance body general rule would sink fact l etoile evidently ignorant 
decomposition proceeded great extent flesh great measure left bones indeed till lose sight corpse 
make argument body found could marie rog three days elapsed body found floating drowned woman might never sunk sunk might reappeared twenty four hours less 
one supposes drowned dying thrown river might found floating period afterwards whatever 
says l etoile body kept mangled state shore tuesday night trace would found shore murderers

balloon 
two decided failures late mr henson sir george cayley much weakened public interest subject aerial navigation 
mr henson scheme first considered feasible even men science founded upon principle inclined plane started eminence extrinsic force applied continued revolution impinging vanes form number resembling vanes windmill 
experiments made models adelaide gallery found operation fans propel machine actually impeded flight 
propelling force ever exhibited mere impetus acquired descent inclined plane impetus carried machine farther vanes rest motion fact sufficiently demonstrates inutility absence propelling also sustaining power whole fabric would necessarily descend 
consideration led sir george cayley think adapting propeller machine independent power support word balloon idea however novel original sir george far regards mode application practice 
exhibited model invention polytechnic institution 
propelling principle power also applied interrupted surfaces vanes put revolution 
vanes four number found entirely ineffectual moving balloon aiding ascending power 
whole project thus complete failure 
juncture mr monck mason whose voyage dover weilburg balloon nassau occasioned much excitement conceived idea employing principle archimedean screw purpose propulsion air rightly attributing failure mr henson scheme sir george cayley interruption surface independent vanes 
made first public experiment willis rooms afterward removed model adelaide gallery 
like sir george cayley balloon ellipsoid 
length thirteen feet six inches height six feet eight inches

model want time necessarily described imperfect manner put action adelaide gallery accomplished velocity five miles per hour although strange say excited little interest comparison previous complex machine mr henson resolute world despise anything carries air simplicity 
accomplish great desideratum rial navigation generally supposed exceedingly complicated application must made unusually profound principle dynamics 
well satisfied however mr mason ultimate success invention determined construct immediately possible balloon sufficient capacity test question voyage extent original design cross british channel nassau balloon

mr henson accompanied friend mr ainsworth admitted private view balloon saturday last two gentlemen made final arrangements included adventure 
informed reason two seamen also included party course day two shall put readers possession minutest particulars respecting extraordinary voyage 
balloon composed silk varnished liquid gum caoutchouc 
vast dimensions containing cubic feet gas coal gas employed place expensive inconvenient hydrogen supporting power machine fully inflated immediately inflation pounds 
coal gas much less costly easily procured managed 
introduction common use purposes aerostation indebted mr charles green 
discovery process inflation exceedingly expensive uncertain 
two even three days frequently wasted futile attempts procure sufficiency hydrogen fill balloon great tendency escape owing extreme subtlety affinity surrounding atmosphere 
balloon sufficiently perfect retain contents coal gas unaltered quantity amount six months equal quantity hydrogen could maintained equal purity six weeks 
supporting power estimated pounds united weights party amounting left surplus exhausted ballast arranged bags different sizes respective weights marked upon cordage barometers telescopes barrels containing provision fortnight water casks cloaks carpet bags various indispensable matters including coffee warmer contrived warming coffee means slack lime dispense altogether fire judged prudent 
articles exception ballast trifles suspended hoop overhead 
car much smaller lighter proportion one appended model 
formed light wicker wonderfully strong frail looking machine 
rim four feet deep 
rudder also much larger proportion model screw considerably smaller 
balloon furnished besides grapnel guide rope latter indispensable importance 
words explanation necessary readers conversant details aerostation 
soon balloon quits earth subjected influence many circumstances tending create difference weight augmenting diminishing ascending power 
example may deposition dew upon silk extent even several hundred pounds ballast thrown machine may descend 
ballast discarded clear sunshine evaporating dew time expanding gas silk whole rapidly ascend 
check ascent recourse rather mr green invention guide rope permission escape gas valve loss gas proportionate general loss ascending power comparatively brief period best constructed balloon must necessarily exhaust resources come earth 
great obstacle voyages length 
guide rope remedies difficulty simplest manner conceivable 
merely long rope suffered trail car effect prevent balloon changing level material degree 
example deposition moisture upon silk machine begins descend consequence necessity discharging ballast remedy increase weight remedied counteracted exactly proportion deposit ground much end rope necessary 
hand circumstances cause undue levity consequent ascent levity immediately counteracted additional weight rope upraised earth 
thus balloon neither ascend descend except within narrow limits resources either gas ballast remain comparatively unimpaired 
passing expanse water becomes necessary employ small kegs copper wood filled liquid ballast lighter nature water 
float serve purposes mere rope land 
another important office guide rope point direction balloon 
rope drags either land sea balloon free latter consequently always advance progress whatever made comparison therefore means compass relative positions two objects always indicate course 
way angle formed rope vertical axis machine indicates velocity 
angle words rope hangs perpendicularly whole apparatus stationary larger angle say farther balloon precedes end rope greater velocity converse
