chapter one 
tale modern war 
reveals explosive nature early career 
remarkable might even say amazing personal adventures relate occurred quite recently 
full interest old mother hasten write yet vivid fresh memory hope may prove interesting say nothing elevating instructive english speaking portions human race throughout world 
dear old lady referred mother one gentlest meekest tenderest beings acquaintance 
regard almost idolatrous 
feelings towards tinged adoration 
earliest years addicted analysis 
younger readers may perhaps know analysis meant reduction compound things elements turning things inside tearing pieces 
complex toys infancy wont reduce elements turned inside see made worked 
doll sister bella moveable eyelids musical stomach treated manner result learned little poor sister suffered much 
everything father house suffered less inquiring tendency mind 
time however abate thirst knowledge developed constructive powers 
became mechanician inventor 
perpetual motion first hobby 
six times course boyhood burst mother presence astounding news discovered last mild trustful believed 
six times also compelled acknowledge mistaken believed thoroughly perhaps first 
one think form least idea delight pursued mechanical wisp 
growing older took chemistry love research analysis found ample scope sufferings father household intensified 
naturally cruel far 
little knew much pain sufferings caused earnestly endeavored lessen neutralise nuisances pursuit science entailed 
could consume smoke prevent explosions convert bad suffocating odours sweet smells 
settling new pursuit intense enthusiasm soon began flow natural course sought extend bounds chemical knowledge 
could help 
particular direction interest ultimately became concentrated explosives 
becoming acquainted gun cotton nitro glycerine dynamite lithofracteur combinations powerfully explosive agents took searching inventing methods might utilised 
turn everything good account desire resist 
explosives naturally drew attention mines tin mines coal mines commercial enterprises 
also suggested war torpedoes 
time reflected nature war 
merely knew science cultivated chiefly human race practice explosives largely used 
blow effectively whether literal figurative sense difficult 
improve power war literal sense set work 
invented torpedo seemed better yet brought 
test powers made miniature fortification blew 
also blew groom jacob lancey 
happened thus miniature fortress made cardboard earth bricks erected yard near stables 
walls torpedo placed match lighted 
night dark 
selected hour suitable destruction enemy stronghold 
match slow burning 
matches invariably circumstances 
suddenly heard sound footsteps 
next moment time give warning jacob lancey came round corner stables pitchfork shoulder walked right fortress 
set foot principal gateway tripped ramparts falling headlong citadel laid banner dust 
instant came terrific flash crash midst smoke flames groom appeared shoot air feelings horror sprang rescue dragged poor fellow smoking debris 
stunned first soon recovered found one fingers left hand completely blown 
words describe feelings 
felt become next thing murderer 
lancey tall powerful man thirty easily killed 
received injury worth mentioning 
although faithful servants irascible anticipated explosion temper recovered sufficiently understand nature injury mistaken 
blowing seemed quite cured temper least regarded afterwards went see penitent face took hand said take master jeffry 
purpus know little finger left hand 
rather hout way otherwise 
moreover used make baccy stopper finger strikes stump fit pipe better pint besides bein less sensitive fire knows ow master jeffry got occasion grieve 
felt little comforted good fellow spoke thus could forgive 
time quite gave chemical experiments ultimately resume went work extreme caution 
long event went college studied medicine 
course nearly completed dear father died 
earnestly desired enter medical profession 
therefore resolved finish course although left possession small estate named fagend devonshire ample income requisite practice livelihood 
one morning considerable time studies completed sat breakfast mother 
jeff said name jeffry childers jeff think twenty four ought know fixed idea future course though independent intend idle 
right mother right replied mean idler nevertheless mean doctor 
shall turn mind chemistry talking expect test powers particular compound today 
said mother peculiar smile nature compound violently explosive said ah course might guessed jeff compounds either violently explosive offensive sometimes name one answering said pulling watch allow ask hour expect bella home day 
half promised breakfast cousin kate would let away 
probable may arrive less hour 
curious coincidence said lover likely arrive time nicholas naranovitsch yes 
ship sailed st petersburg arrived late last night received telegram saying first train morning 
love know said wings 
pair given naranovitsch keeping powerful frame bear swiftly fagend 
may interest reader point know sister bella engaged previous year one dearest college friends young russian whose father sent finish education england 
father merchant many whose dealings russia frequently visited st petersburg twice mother sister accompanied thither 
met naranovitsch family 
young nicholas army fine looking fellow one could wish see 
strong manly gentle manner tender heart 
sister bella sweetest quite pretty young well matter bella may say one sweetest girls england fell love course 
wonder visit place devonshire end college career bella became engaged 
nicholas returned st petersburg obtain parents consent union make arrangements 
rich could afford marry 
time write coming back claim bride father thought still young see pay us visit 
know mother said young people seen half hour naturally want take walk ride half hour interrupted mother one peculiar little smiles 
well hour like two prefer returned events want walk luncheon shall take opportunity show experiments prove power singular compound questioned 
explosive yes 
name dynamite 
may jeff something awful daresay remarked mother look interest sipped tea 
awful indeed said least effects sometimes tremendous 
worse gunpowder ay much worse though prefer say better gunpowder 
dear rejoined mother lifting eyebrows little surprise 
yes much better continued gunpowder bursts things pretty well jeff way violence yes nothing dynamite powder bursts things dynamite shatters 
dreadful dynamite explain said must know compound 
dear dear sighed mother many compounds told jeff since took chemistry uncompounded things simple things world yes mother simple thing wish good many simple things like world foolish jeff answer question 
well mother indeed simple elements creation dynamite one 
composed excessively explosive oil named nitro glycerine compound earth called kieselguhr 
earth explosive mixed nitro glycerine render liquid less dangerous compound named dynamite form made sold immense quantities mining purposes 
added pulling pocket cartridge nearly two inches length inch diameter 
soft pasty substance done see cartridge paper little thing properly fired would blow large boulder stone atoms 
bless boy careful exclaimed mother pushing back chair alarm 
danger said reassuring tones cartridge opened set fire spark flame would first place light readily second place would merely burn without exploding put detonator inside fire means would explode violence far exceeds force gunpowder 
wonderful detonator jeff excites latent fury dynamite much amused pat way mother questioned became interested continued explanation 
must know said many powders violently explosive others 
violence explosion called detonation meant almost instantaneous conversion ultimate molecules explosive compound ie whole concern gas 
see mean goes quickly said mother simple way eminently characteristic 
well yes much quickly gunpowder 
better say powder detonates explodes instant 
gunpowder appears reality 
one best detonators fulminate mercury 
detonating caps therefore made one cap put middle cartridge dynamite set fire means would convert cartridge detonator explode shattering effect 
human continued sometimes illustrates principle figuratively mean violent explosion large cartridge means small detonator 
take example schoolmaster suppose dynamite cartridge 
heart detonating cap 
schoolroom boys form galvanic battery 
brain may likened conducting wire 
enters schoolroom chemical elements seething riot books torn thrown ink spilt etcetera 
opening door good man quiet piece plastic dynamite instant eye touched electric circuit completed mysterious current flashes brain fires detonating heart 
instantly gleaming flame shoots lightning speed temples toes 
entire man becomes detonator explodes violent hurricane kicks cuffs invective without detonator heart man might burned moderate wrath could exploded 
try illustration jeff said plain spoken mother gently patting arm one strong points 
perhaps understand think hazy sort way 
dear mother always professes comprehend things hazily indeed sometimes fear conceptions rather abstruse matters bring always correct delightful watch profound interest listens patient efforts makes understand 
must justice add sometimes though often displays gleams clear intelligence powers close incisive reasoning quite surprise 
return speaking future plans said seems would good thing travel year see world 
might worse boy said mother 
view continued resolved purchase yacht must complete new torpedo invented navy hope may introduced navy 
working model outhouse ready exhibition 
finished shall show lords admiralty accepted throw study overboard time go cruise 
ah jeff jeff sighed mother shake head never leave till get blown 
suppose must way 
always dear boy 
never opposition wishes mother 
quite true jeff quite true 
comes wonder fond fire smoke fumes crash clatter explosions really said somewhat amused question tell unless owing something law compensation appears permeate universe 
abhorrence fire fumes smoke crash clatter explosions son bound take special delight chemical analysis combination say nothing mechanical force contrivance order balance sort may adjusted would otherwise thrown order pardon comparative ignorance indifference matters 
nay jeff replied mother gently look reproof kind face ignorance indifference 
indifferent anything interests 
true forgive said dislike 
yes would correct jeff pretend like bursting smoking ill smelling things fond know interested 
forgotten boy used run call witness pyrotechnic hydraulic mechanic chemic displays see well remember names acids interrupted taking theme ruined carpets table cloths smoke stifled blinded noise flames terrified mother forgotten patient way took loss old silk dress ah yes sighed dear old lady quite pitiful look wedding dress well use regretting know jeff would checked worlds knew led right way though folly sometimes wished way little removed smoke smells 
careful dear boy wonderfully years little accidents give much pain beyond day occurrence 
poisoning cat sure sad though unavoidable destruction fire cook hair flooding house repairs executed great cistern blowing laundry window time clothes boiler cracked trifles sort remainder mother speech cut short clattering hoofs 
next moment sister bella came round corner house full gallop fresh face beaming exercise golden hair streaming breeze 
pulled leaped pony ran room 
observed tall soldierly man appear avenue advancing rapid strides 
well know grave handsome face 
comes nicholas said turning round bella fled 
observed friend instead coming straight room window mother saluted turned sharp library 
running door welcome mother called back 
turned looked 
smiled 
without uttering word sat finish breakfast 
ah jeff said mother little sigh wish would fall love one fall love mother nonsense could doubt plenty loveable girls one charming little well matter moment nicholas entered room heartily saluted mother cut short conversation 
chapter two 
still explosive first 
much surprise found neither nicholas naranovitsch bella mother would consent witness experiments dynamite day 
old chum approached greet lawn breakfast day following could help admiring fine tall athletic figure 
know always felt somehow looked although exactly height six feet one without boots 
suppose must owing standing erect slouched little 
perhaps looking mentally something 
come day said referring experiments 
course old boy added smile one condition 
may bother bella minute details 
course promised say word unless asked explanations breakfast went part grounds wished bring cultivation 
time encumbered several large trees old roots number boulders 
come along us lancey said groom also laboratory assistant met stable yard scene memorable blowing 
try effect explosive wish understand details 
yes sir replied lancey respectful touch cap must say sir allow never knowed one like sir goin details except one one ah yes know friend scotch boy said interrupting lancey privileged servant would interrupted 
yes sir resumed scotch boy sandy 
school together edinburgh got edication never see boy sir goin yes yes lancey know time talk 
going bit waste ground hollow follow us 
obliged cut short scotch hero subject could resist dilating slightest encouragement 
arrived waste ground met manager neighbouring mine deeply learned everything connected blasting 
brought mother sister see mr jones said approached 
quite believe giant power control seem think little stronger gunpowder 
soon change views point said manager slight bow ladies introduced nicholas officer russian army 
one stones wish blast said mr jones laying hand enormous boulder weighed probably several tons 
answered 
manager man action grave countenance words 
drew flask pocket emptied contents large quantity gunpowder boulder 
asking us stand little back applied slow match heap retired several paces 
seconds powder went violent puff vast cloud smoke 
result little shriek alarm mother exclamation bella 
much effect see said manager pointing blackened stone yet large quantity powder fired cavity inside stone would blown pieces 
small quantity dynamite 
produced cartridge two inches length similar shown mother breakfast 
cartridge shall insert detonator cap fastened end pickford fuse thus 
spoke inserted cartridge end fuse attached small cap filled fulminate mercury tied tightly 
done laid cartridge top boulder placed two three similar cartridges beside covered small quantity sand leaving end fuse projecting 
sand asked bella 
slight amount confinement advantageous replied mr jones 
bore short hole stone put dynamite therein result would still effective covering put suffice serve better show great difference explosive gunpowder 
said mother tendency become suddenly interested things began faint understanding mr jones give powder fair play 
covered sand would effect powerful stone madam would blown covering violence would 
ladies gentlemen retire behind shelter old beech tree light fuse 
desired 
manager lighted fuse followed us 
moments occurred explosion violent huge boulder shattered several pieces quite small enough lifted carted away 
amazing exclaimed bella enthusiasm 
quite obvious anticipation thorough result 
nicholas may mention natural turn taste matters roused state inquiry 
question put mr jones explained taking powers consideration dynamite cheaper gunpowder saved much labor would taken two men considerable time bored ordinary blasthole boulder broken 
led way another part ground grew large beech tree whose giant roots took firm grasp ground 
hundred years old least twelve feet circumference sixty feet high 
one similar tree cut labor great removal stump excessively troublesome well costly 
mr jones went work forest giant 
ground underneath tree ordered lancey make hole crowbar 
pressed cartridges dynamite wooden rammer 
cartridge detonator inside fuse extending mouth placed contact charge tree 
hole next closed earth leaving foot fuse outside 
light applied retired safe distance 
moments charge exploded 
tree seemed rise bed 
earth blown roots torn broken exception four largest fully ten inches diameter 
small charge dynamite inserted completed work old giant slowly bowing forward laid venerable head upon ground 
another charge next placed soil loose decayed roots easily broken pieces permit removal 
thus short time little cost trees roots boulders torn shattered 
dynamite dangerous mr jones asked mother walked slowly homeward 
dangerous least worth speaking replied manager nitro glycerine indeed dangerous easily exploded concussion mere vibration mixed infusorial earth thus converted dynamite one safest explosives existence quite safe indeed gun cotton much gunpowder 
sort fire explode gunpowder sort fire explode dynamite cause burn 
requires detonator explode violence 
without detonator dynamite sleeping giant 
ay mother said taking subject case stands thus gunpowder big athlete slumbers lightly spark wake violent action dynamite bigger athlete sleeps soundly spark flame rouse moderate rage requires special shake make wide awake thus roused fury terrific seen 
added drew near house change subject morning received two letters demand united consideration whole party 
therefore call bella nicholas fallen behind usual 
mr jones excuse talking family matters minutes replies must sent return post 
explained one letters invitation mother sister friends might chance visiting us go portsmouth witness variety interesting experiments torpedoes warlike things letter offer friend schooner built yacht moderate sum 
nicholas said apologetically sorry give explosive reception helped 
care torpedoes may remain mother bella would like go shall happy introduce one two naval friends 
must go go jeff interrupted bella nothing could appropriate sequel morning experiments 
day among torpedoes interesting looked nicholas whose arm leaned 
looked peculiar smile seemed lie eyes lips muttered something day anywhere etcetera etcetera 
mother remarked understand exactly torpedo looked explanation 
confess remark surprised course investigations inventions frequently mentioned subject torpedoes twice given particular description destructive machine 
however evidently forgotten resist temptation elucidate complex subjects opportunity offers began machine mother bursts interrupted bella little laugh 
explanation dear returned mother least distinctive one guns burst sometimes soap bubbles burst eggs burst occasionally 
bella said nicholas spoke english perfectly though slightly foreign accent never interrupt philosopher 
allow jeff proceed definition 
well torpedo said infernal machine jeff said mother seriously mother use word advisedly dispassionately 
term frequently given engines horrible nature suggests idea originated region satanic influence 
torpedo pretty large case box cask reservoir one form another filled gunpowder gun cotton dynamite used chiefly water blowing purposes 
sometimes men use torpedoes blow rocks sunken wrecks sometimes grieve say blow ships sailors 
dreadful dear said mother nevertheless like go excursion see devices men invent purpose killing 
well settled said letter yacht 
buy mother go cruise mediterranean one condition namely nicholas bella go 
impossible exclaimed mother firmly never could bear sea 
little experience said well much bear 
mother said coaxingly bella dying go sea know 
nicholas loads time left behind wish much go fall ground refuse accompany us 
leave house alone 
sea air certainly good land know lisbon gibraltar nice anywhere return home overland 
well go returned pliant mother 
right said sitting write 
get ready go london afternoon 
shall spend day two leaving must see first lord admiralty particular business 
afterwards shall run portsmouth afternoon express spend night ready face torpedoes morning 
chapter three 
interview men power 
something peculiarly exhilarating bright sunshine calm weather 
doubt truism truths one never tires regard one feels ever recurring freshness 
ever wearied balmy breeze bright sunrise even glorious noon pall upon us unless hot 
bright sunshine associated good health pleasant company successful courtship prospect light favorite study reader understand mother nicholas bella formed peculiarly happy quartette perambulated streets london prior visit admiralty 
friday forenoon many holiday keepers hastening trains 
corner one main thoroughfares crowd partly blocked road 
cause became apparent us head arched neck black charger appeared white plume polished cuirass life guardsman 
stood door step bella might see troop 
passed us stately bearing man horse always seemed peculiar life guards sun flashed dazzling gleams breasts helmets glanced friend naranovitsch 
soldierlike form drawn full height flashing eye flushed countenance distended nostrils compressed slightly smiling lips told thought strong feeling martial joy 
doubtless thinking moment regiment recently appointed comrades arms 
fine looking fellows whispered 
splendid glorious said deep low voice 
bella looked quickly displaying anxious sorrowing face bright eyes dimmed ill suppressed tears 
ill bella whispered bending look tenderness unmixed surprise 
oh replied low tone sight guards made sad 
knew full well cause emotion crowded street suitable place explanation 
come follow said walked quickly along direction strand turned abruptly one quiet courts form harbors refuge rattle turmoil great city 
sauntering slowly round quiet precincts court roar street subdued murmur like distant cataract bella told nicholas tones deepest pathos german lady elsie goeben one dearest friends married handsomest best men one prussian cavalry regiments 
six months union franco prussian war broke elsie husband wilhelm sent regiment frontier many engagements distinguished last mortally wounded one sorties siege metz 
find till next day continued sister fallen part field far advance ground dead comrades lay overlooked 
riddled bullets say noble face often seen beaming affection young wife torn disfigured friends could scarcely recognize 
still alive found knew voice 
raised merely exclaimed last thank god deep sigh relief 
words terrible significance told long long night agony dreadful solitude quite alone sister added low voice christian 
died reaching tents division 
bella voice faltered said moment pause dear elsie never recovered shock 
joined husband heaven two months afterwards 
truly said war terrible curse 
hate detest cried bella sudden tone look energy impressive natural character gentle retiring 
saw nicholas surprised pained 
would fain comforted bella knew say trained talk martial glory look war medium halo false glitter surrounded many historians ages 
young russian hitherto dwelt chiefly one aspect war 
thought noble heroic deeds defense hearth home man holds sacred 
fight country nicholas idea called thoughts devotion self sacrifice good cause duty fidelity courage romance regard minor things warrior life hazy notion dash glitter music gaiety floated brain 
course ignorant darker shades war 
history told many gallant deeds also recorded numberless dreadful acts 
latter dismissed disagreeable unavoidable accompaniments war 
simply accepted things found addicted close reasoning trouble much rectitude wisdom war abstract 
neither distinguish righteous unrighteous war war self defense war aggression 
sufficient served country faithfully 
good general principle doubt youthful officer one expected rise power influence native land something definite would ultimately required 
yet neither experienced excitement beheld miseries bathed called glory war corner dark cloud unexpectedly flung bella sorrow felt deeply sympathetic helpless 
sad look however gentle pressure hand rested arm quite sufficient bella 
relieve friend embarrassment pulled watch urged walk direction admiralty hour interview nearly arrived 
charing cross parted proceeded mission plan torpedo nicholas styled infernal machine pocket rather anxious heart breast although quite certain invention superior others inasmuch fulfilled several conditions fulfilled torpedoes feel sure lords admiralty would take view 
besides machine tried model might act perfectly tested actual warfare 
course knew inventive powers would readily overcome weak point cropped view practice 
met gracious reception first lord 
beside seated two elderly gentlemen judged brother lords 
needless recount passed memorable interview 
suffice say given careful clear explanation invention three lords listened marked attention first lord said bland smile mr childers peculiar point superiority torpedoes claim confess question damped little remarkably explicit explanations lasted nearly hour 
however utmost alacrity went chief points 
observe lord said pointing drawing lay spread table watch work arrangement heart machine intimately connected lever screw exterior passing case launched sea machinery set motion first act torpedo set regulate special purpose designed 
thus may styled automatic torpedo 
celebrated whitehead fish torpedo beautiful cleverly contrived though advance straight object certain depth surface mine see arrangement main pneumatic engine connects watch work regulator eccentric wheel fin outside causes torpedo describe curve size direction progress 
thus wish hit enemy vessel venture fire friendly ship happening lie set eccentric indicator required curve send torpedo mission destruction right bottom friendly ship laying torpedo side easily go round afterwards hit enemy 
ah see said first lord grave nod last succeeded making long held impossible instrument shoot round corner 
well yes lord although confess struck light 
continued feeling enthusiasm rise first lord became appreciative weapon may used even attacking fortresses sea making may call inverted trajectory curve high torpedo may made rush surface water gradually curve upwards shoot right native element go straight fort town hill least hundred feet level sea 
indeed exclaimed first lord 
observed two lords gazing looks banished every expression except intense surprise 
regarding sign merits invention beginning tell went yes lord action thing absolutely certain distance object aimed ascertained nicety arrangements watch work indicator adjusted eccentric wheel pneumatic engine mathematical precision 
course days thorough education easily done even youngest officer ship 
mentioned however required send torpedo citadel fortress hill would necessary use stronger explosive yet known gun cotton dynamite weak nitro glycerine dangerous therefore inadmissible 
ha exclaimed first lord explosive found laboratory devonshire lord answered look diffidence feeling uncertain would take announcement 
moments contemplated perfect silence observed two lords smiled 
felt perplexed awkwardness moment quickly removed first lord asking new compound made 
lord said secret 
wish sell secret government lord replied dignity wish let government possess slight gift lies power present addition loyal heart afford let secret known unless assurance shall held inviolable 
assurance said first lord supposed loyal subject character british admiralty would sufficient guarantee nothing would required 
require assurance lord said hastily merely wish understand important secrecy observed 
reveal 
rose whispered first lord ear 
turned pale sat whispered two lords looked grave augured good fortune invention 
time surprised communication way alarming though connected explosives 
presently first lord touched bell 
servant uniform appeared words disappeared 
puzzled silent 
mr childers said first lord shall give invention best attention must tell many others country well exerting minds discover effectual method spreading wholesale devastation among fellow creatures forgive interrupting lord exclaimed look horror repudiate entirely intention destroy fellow creatures 
motives matter purely scientific 
doubt returned first lord smile nevertheless tendency labors towards destruction reference fact merely purpose informing many inventors claimed attention designs must expect immediate decision regard 
politely bowed passed corridor could help feeling disappointed rather faint success visit 
idea would destroyer species never occurred whole soul faculties hitherto engrossed simple idea perfecting chemical explosive mechanical contrivance 
thus unintentionally sometimes lend hearts revolt 
noticed servant summoned first lord discussing torpedo particularly attentive careful seeing premises first time flashed across mind taken madman 
tickled idea burst sudden fit hearty laughter act induced little boy policeman old woman chanced passing imbibe erroneous view first lord 
however although grievously disheartened subdued 
hope tells many flattering tales told proper consideration admiralty would infallibly perceive value invention regard destruction fellow creatures consoled reflection torpedoes much calculated defensive offensive warfare 
quitting subject may state day never heard admiralty reference invention 
fact gives pain although first 
explain 
friend mine grave kindly young man yet withal sarcastic eccentric met immediately visit admiralty 
strange friend crops sorts unexpected times divers places one least expects 
name u biquitous 
dear childers said explained matters victim victim self delusion 
victimised self delusion first met time thought discovered perpetual motion 
torpedo described impossibility ass said looking face 
means returned biquitous earnestly enthusiast without ballast 
enthusiasm fine noble quality 
want ballast grievous misfortune 
study mechanics boy little yet done venturing inventions theorise much 
revelling late regions fancy 
take advice 
wont said fervently give cherished pursuits 
reason returned friend grasping hand earnest advice continue lay ballast possible 
cheery words ringing ears rejoined mother sister went portsmouth 
well however state personal investigations matter explosives time received death blow 
went indeed intense interest see display national destructive powers portsmouth never ventured add little quota sum human knowledge subjects reader may henceforth depend upon shall hereafter write shall drawn distinct unmistakable line region fact fancy 
chapter four 
day torpedoes 
sentence finished last chapter appears essential describe may seem many readers like dreams fancy details sober fact 
mother nicholas bella arrived portsmouth met naval friend young lieutenant seemed beau ideal embryo naval hero 
middle height broad lithe athletic handsome countenance beaming good belief everybody including 
self possessed impressively attentive ladies young old suave gentlemen healthy wild stag happy young cricket budding moustache fluff either cheek 
though gentle lamb peace said demon war bore inappropriate name firebrand 
allow introduce friend lieutenant naranovitsch mr firebrand mother sister late hope said shaking hands 

capital time replied young fellow gaily bowed 
allow mrs childers take arm 
boat far 
boat exclaimed mother must go sea exactly replied firebrand light laugh unless dignify portchester creek name 
nettle target ship lies must go board around connection various experiments tried means gunboats launches steam pinnaces various kinds small craft 
fortunate charming day said mother whose interest aroused youth cheery manner 
expect many people witness experiments mr firebrand five hundred invitations issued answered lieutenant daresay invited come 
occasion importance termination senior course instruction naval torpedo school 
happy think added arch smile officer russian army good opportunity witnessing england preparing enemies 
afford greatest pleasure witness experiments replied nicholas returning smile interest england russia best friends shall hope never enemies 
minutes conveyed board nettle whose deck animated assemblage 
present hundreds gaily dressed visitors officers naval military bright varied uniforms also number chinese students whose gaudy peculiar garments added novelty well brilliancy scene 
delightful murmured bella listened sweet strains commander chief band gazed dreamily sun flashes danced glassy water 
paradise replied naranovitsch looking eyes 
going asked mother young firebrand kept possession whole proceedings explained everything 
going illustrate application torpedo science offensive defensive warfare said lieutenant see send outrigger launch make attack two torpedoes one either bow filled pounds gunpowder 
sometimes gun cotton used pounds charge powder quite sufficient send vessel stand bottom five ten minutes 
come way shall see operations better point 
alarmed slightest danger assure 
spoke reassuring tones led mother side ship whither followed became absorbed going 
outrigger launch referred goodly sized boat fitted small engine screw propeller 
chief peculiarities two long poles spars lay along sides projecting beyond bows 
outriggers 
projecting end spar fixed iron case bearing resemblance shape size elongated kettle drum 
torpedoes 
heard lieutenant explain mother one torpedoes chanced explode hung would blow boat men atoms 
mother replied horrible asked case crew could fire escape 
whereupon responded shall see presently 
another peculiarity launch species iron hood shield like broad low sentry box behind protection men formed crew could steer work outriggers galvanic battery without exposed 
little boat seemed like vicious wasp left side ship rapid throbbing engine twirling miniature screw 
sufficient distance ship order given officer charge 
immediately outrigger right starboard side run invisible hands full extent apparently fifteen feet beyond bow launch inner end outrigger tilted violently air end torpedo thrust ten feet surface water 
told depth enemy ship ought struck 
launch still going full speed supposed run close enemy submerged torpedo strike 
another order given 
operator gave needful touch galvanic battery like faithful servants instantly sent spark fire torpedo 
result tremendous 
column seething mud water twenty feet diameter shot full thirty feet air overwhelming launch shower many unprofessional spectators imagined lost 
thus imaginary ironclad sent tremendous hole bottom sea 
imaginary result seen sequel tale 
shock made nettle tremble exclaimed surprise 
oh poor boat cried mother 
fear boat said young firebrand nettle good fellow felt greatest ironclad mighty thunderer honor officer quiver slightly explosion mere five pounds torpedo discharged close alongside 
people adequate conception power explosives still fewer believe understand nature powers times surrounded 
pounds torpedo instance caused us quiver would blown hole powerful ship fired contact yet cushion water tiny launch fired tough quite sufficient protection boat see 
indeed see waspish little boat emerged deluge raised steaming swiftly turned round retraced track 
reaching position nettle repeated experiment second torpedo 
splendid exclaimed young naranovitsch whose military ardor aroused 
means said bella splendid ship destroyed hundreds lives lost well yes said nicholas hesitatingly course always follow know many lives paused smiled perplexed look 
bella smiled dubiously shook head appear either exact number lives lost much question 
sudden movement visitors side ship stopped conversation 
preparing show effect gun cotton hand grenade words species bomb shell meant thrown hand enemy boat close quarters 
really tremendous weapon innocent looking disc circlet gun cotton weighing eight ounces 
innocent would truth little detonator heart without would burned exploded 
attached disc instantaneous fuse length operator could throw disc passing boat fire fuse would instantly explode disc 
carefully explained firebrand astonished mother disc experimental purposes placed cask floating water 
fuse fired cask blown matchwood wreck complete ignorant spectator could fail understand would fate boat crew similar circumstances 
awful said mother 
pray mr firebrand gun worsted mean cotton 
young lieutenant smiled rather broadly explained glib slightly sing song tone savored woolwich military academy gun cotton name given explosive substance produced action nitric acid mixed sulphuric acid cotton fiber 
going add contains carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen corresponding mother stopped 
dear mr firebrand popular explanation impossible impossible madam rather difficult 
let see 
gun cotton chemical compound elements named chemical compound observe mechanical mixture like gunpowder 
hence explodes rapidly latter power three six times greater 
mother looked perplexed 
difference asked chemical compound mechanical mixture firebrand turn looked perplexed 
madam exclaimed modulated desperation ultimate molecules mixture placed beside atom gunpowder may saltpetre charcoal sulphur dependent fellow atoms power act whereas chemical compound perfect union substances ultimate molecule complete definite proportions four elements therefore independent little atom 
next experiment continued firebrand glad opportunity changing subject meant illustrate method countermining 
must know enemies may sometimes sink torpedoes entrance harbors prevent ships war entering 
torpedoes consist usually casks cases explosives fired either electric wires like telegraph ships seen passing contact 
say enemy ship entering harbor runs something sets something else motion explodes torpedo blows ship natives green isle call smithereens 
satisfactory happens enemy happens one self therefore enter enemy harbor countermine 
operation illustrated 
last experiments exhibited power offensive torpedoes 
several different kinds mr whitehead fish torpedo harvey torpedo others 
dear said mother perplexed air thought mr firebrand torpedoes offensive 
means placed entrance harbors navigable rivers defensive 
protect offensive weapon use crinolines 
mother looked quickly polite young mentor 
play ignorance old woman sir said half jocular air 
indeed madam assure returned firebrand much earnestness 
every iron clad provided crinoline powerful iron network hung round ship distance like pardon lady crinoline intended intercept torpedo may discharged 
attention called point counter mining experiments 
may said regard conducted various ways always end view namely destroy enemy mines exploding others midst 
sake illustration supposed surrounding sea bottom studded invisible torpedoes nettle warship determined advance enemy harbor 
effect safety order clear away supposed sunken torpedoes counter torpedo floated two empty casks sent floating desired direction means tide 
countermine consisted iron cylinder containing pounds powder electrically connected nettle 
small charge gun cotton fixed suspender held torpedo casks 
safe distance ship charge fired 
cut suspender let torpedo sink bottom 
exploded terrific violence quickly shown mighty fountain mud water smoke instantly shot air 
proved experiment pounds gun cotton exploded water destroy torpedoes lie within radius yards 
obvious therefore warship could advance space thus cleared send second countermine ahead way 
neither tide current wind serve drift casks operation might accomplished small boat could back danger laying torpedo thus step step shot shot advance could made safety enemy defences 
twelve small charges gun cotton sunk various directions representing countermine pounds 
discharged simultaneously demonstrate possibility extending operations wide area 
miniature charges sent small nets quite unprotected water gun cotton wet fired 
fact caught attention mother 
go wet exclaimed turning bright little eyes astonishment young companion 
ha one strange peculiarities gun cotton replied firebrand amused look require keep dry like powder 
necessary one small lump dry gun cotton inside wet stuff detonator heart 
detonator must know oh know detonator said mother quickly 
well continued firebrand exploding detonator dry disc causes wet gun cotton also go seen 
going exhibit one modes defending harbors 
sunk four mines pounds gunpowder far see yon black specks floating water 
black specks buoys called circuit closers contain delicate contrivance compound mechanism galvanism buoys bumped close electric circuit cause mine explode 
thus ship war sails one circuit closers immediately blown 
rather sneaking way killing one enemies asked mother 
young firebrand laughed admitted pleaded everything fair love war 
actual warfare circuit closers placed mines designed explode safety occasion placed safe distance respective mines 
steam launch used bump prodigious upheaval water explosion showed clearly enough would fate iron clad mine 
oh shade nelson could help exclaiming shocked must permitted witness methods conducting war 
ah yes sighed firebrand bubble reputation see transferred cannon mouth torpedo 
made reply mind reverted laboratory devonshire lay working model terrible weapon spent much time perfecting 
seemed strange eager pursuit scientific object scarcely ever reflected dire results use torpedo involved felt really guilty intent murder 
leaving home charged model quite large one capable holding pounds dynamite hope might prevail first lord admiralty colleagues come see actually fired 
resolved throw dynamite sea break model done explosives ever 
mind running startled explosion close alongside 
turning towards side ship found caused rending huge iron chain links one quarter inch thickness 
powerful cable could held iron clad snapped twain like piece thread explosion two half pounds gun cotton 
well done said firebrand think much smaller quantity dynamite would done effectively 
mrs childers said young lieutenant last experiment made think interest even others 
see send electrical steam pinnace 
spoke boat prepared alongside ship 
exclaimed mother almost speechless surprise forgotten send crew 
madam said firebrand one blandest smiles forgotten crew services dangerous although courage british sailor course enable face anything thought advisable put severe test hence automatic boat invented 
steered operations performed means electricity applied board boat board nettle 
indeed case 
electric pinnace went spoke steam engines steering gear apparatus regulated electric wires paid ship boat proceeded mission supposed extreme danger 
right withering fire imaginary enemy batteries went scorned rain small shot swept like hail escaped plunging heavy shot fell every side dropped mine stern exploded means slow fuse turned round steamed back triumph amid cheers spectators 
last really marvellous sight little boat seemed indeed deserve encomiums firebrand said cool calm pluck face appalling danger merited anything heroic little steam pinnace ought receive victoria cross 
still meditating subject listening animated comments going around received shock compared explosions day witnessed nothing 
suddenly recurred memory left compound laboratory home state chemical preparation required watching prevent catching fire certain part process 
called away compound suddenly nicholas left london taken tell totally forgotten 
mere burning compound would nothing laboratory old house quite unconnected dwelling laboratory also lay torpedo worst inserted detonator affixed fuse feeling quite secure invariably locked door carried key pocket 
face must turned pale nicholas came moment looked anxious surprise asked ill 
said hurriedly ill yes slow process best always certain sometimes takes day two culminate 
fusion may quite completed may failed altogether 
late fear late rest till know 
tell mother home business alarm 
regardless amazed looks stood near broke grasp nicholas leaped one boats alongside seized oars rowed ashore mad haste 
fortune favored 
train left though motion 
time take ticket leaping upon moving footboard wrenched open carriage door sprang 
express 
went full sixty miles hour yet felt moved like snail 
words adequately explain state mind body almost uncontrollable desire felt spring train run ahead 
forced sit still think 
thought nearness laboratory kitchen windows tremendous energy explosive model torpedo charged mass combustibles kinds surrounded thousand one possibilities case inexcusable madness careful 
last train pulled town residence two miles distant

jeff boy returned nicholas smile sleepy discuss subject say agree 
indeed look sleepy riding many hours forbore trouble 
daybreak morning drew near town giurgevo roumanian may say russian side danube soon afterwards entered 
considerable excitement visible among inhabitants even early hour moving hurriedly streets 
parted escort nicholas refreshed hotel de l europe went hospital companion wished visit wounded friend one said lately taken part dashing though unsuccessful expedition 
visit giurgevo first introduction actual miseries war 
hospital clean well ventilated building 
rows low beds ranged neatly methodically along whitewashed walls 
tenanted young men every stage suffering exhaustion 
bandaged heads limbs sat reclined lay slightly wounded still ruddy hue health young cheeks cut marred visage limbs pale cheeks blue lips told life blood almost drained 
others lying flat backs soft brown moustache curly brown hair contrasting terribly gray hue approaching death 
one beds found friend nicholas

dear nicholas said reply word condolence failure expedition misunderstand whole matter 
doubtless succeed fault glorious attempt 
come relate 
friend speak russian events understands said assurance youth raised hand bandaged brow recall events related incident following substance 
russians actively engaged preparing cross danube part river full small islands turks sent monitors gunboats interrupt operations 
russians vessels capable facing huge ironclads enemy 
ten small boats place eight engaged laying torpedoes river protect works two detailed watch enemy 
busily work watchers boat named schootka heard sound approaching steamer soon descried turkish gunboat steaming river 
went little schootka like wasp deadly torpedo end spar 
gun boat saw sought evade put full steam hugged turkish shore hundreds circassian riflemen kept incessant fire russian boat 
hit commander wounded crew second command resolved carry attack 
schootka increased speed consternation turks succeeded touching gun boat behind paddle boxes torpedo refused explode schootka compelled haul make shelter heavy fire gun boat circassian riflemen quite riddled 
making second turkish gun boat hove sight 
schootka still another torpedo board one harvey principle 
torpedo may described somewhat square flat case charged explosive compound 
used thrown sea runs water edge held position rope caused advance pulling sidewise 
anglers understand state works principle otter somewhat like celebrated irish pig going market runs ahead pulled back tail 
torpedo daring russians resolved attack second gunboat threw overboard would work something gone wrong tail levers coming contact enemy explode 
compelled therefore abandon attempt seek shelter turkish fire behind island 
said quitting hospital torpedoes although terrible action always certain 
nothing always certain replied nicholas smile except flight time matter come requires attention must leave hours 
forget name hotel 
secure man mind may lose town city perfect safety au revoir 
time walked town

lancey saw happened also dismounted 
rest detachment sight moment 
sound pursuers found left thus lonely spot among hills 
examining fallen turk found hit two balls

dead said lancey solemnly kneeled beside body 
eskiwin made answer grave countenance expressed nothing stern decision

sound pursuers heard searching neighbouring thicket 
eskiwin rose slowly bayonet began dig grave

chapter sixteen 
lancey gets embroiled troubles sees peculiar service 
meanwhile jacob lancey impressed belief turkish detachment taken mountains traveled rapidly possible direction 
next morning daybreak found thoroughly exhausted unable proceed 
difficulty climbed neighbouring eminence clear bushes gave view country around 
small village hamlet within stone throw 
sight revived drooping spirits 
descended found one stirring even dog 
perceiving small outhouse door ajar went peeped 
bundles straw corner 
temptation irresistible 
entered flung straw fell sound asleep almost immediately 
sun shining high heavens awakened rude shake 
started found rough grasp bulgarian peasant 
lancey although mentally morally man peace physically pugnacious 
grappled bulgarian said powerful fellow soon back hand compressing windpipe knee thrust stomach 
would certainly fared ill bulgarian day villager attracted hut noise scuffle 
seeing matters stood uttered shout brought scene three villagers overwhelmed lancey bound led chief man place 
chief man turk black beard 
lancey course expected receive severe punishment without trial 
hearing merely attacked bulgarian turk seemed rather inclined favor prisoner otherwise 
events ascertaining could communicate known language sent kitchen obtain meal afterwards allowed depart evident indignation bulgarian friends however dare show feelings 
time lancey wandered endeavoring make friends people without success 
day advanced men women went work fields 
feeling obtained nearly enough sleep wanderer took opportunity slipping another outhouse climbed empty loft 
small hole loft near floor 
lay pillowed head beam found could see greater part village hole fact barely reached brain fallen heavy slumber exhausted man 
next awakening caused shouts cries 
raised one elbow looked hole 
large body russian soldiers entered village welcomed wild joy bulgarians turkish inhabitants able willing leave remained quiet polite

justice paid though cases payment little

felt therefore comparatively safe watched doings soldiery opened wallet made hearty meal debris rations 
finished trumpets sounded troops fell column left place 
occurred scene astonished little 
sooner troops sight bulgarian population rising en masse fell upon turkish brethren maltreated terribly 
indeed murder pillaged burned houses behaved altogether wild savage manner 
lancey could understand 
perhaps known bulgarians many years suffered horrible oppression contemptuous treatment turks whose misrule lay might felt less surprise though might justified act revenge 
true worm turns foot crushes surely matter wonder human beings long debased defrauded demoralised turn bite somewhat savagely opportunity offers occurred lancey russians arrived would well descend join troops get present predicament remembering actually accepted service turks clothed semi turkish costume might taken spy resolved remain

chapter seventeen 
desperate enterprises undertaken 
time russians taken strong position balkan mountain range entrenched within short distance enemy 
night day aimless wandering jacob lancey found last rocky defile hostile lines

evening setting made discovery recoiled happily without seen narrow rocky place fast failing light already deepened gloom 
cold white fog slowly creeping valleys covering hill sides

two ventures afoot night 
russian camp preparations made night attack village possession turks view future movements deemed necessary drive 
village dwelt youth intimate friend dobri petroff

thus chanced overhear occasional remarks hints pieced together intelligent mind showed pretty clearly pending 
sat camp fire night buried meditation series troubled wrinkles brow usually open unclouded 
many time light pipe forget smoke relight let die comrades impressed absence mind 
well scout know time certain fate village fought contending armies 
warn friend borronow time remove sister doomed village became scout duty must performed hazards without deserting post appearing go enemy difficulty 
something troubles said young friend andre vanovitch time sat smoking quietly side gazing fire thinking doubt girl auburn hair far away land muscove 
yes troubled friends scout laconic answer 
oh right may sure fellows crossed danube force said andre supposing referred family 
perhaps returned petroff relapsed silence 
suddenly occurred overheard expression among officers around general desire know particularly disposition turkish force suggestion spy sent 
brow cleared almost triumphant look countenance turned sharply andre seized arm 
well dobri said latter smile look surprise perfect faith strength grip without requiring positive proof

certain would accept replied scout return perplexed look chanced refuse leave case would hopeless could would dare act opposition positive orders whereas go without leave shall blamed undertaking foolish reckless act return safety 
return matter said done count andre explaining desert

injustice lad said petroff quietly

visit every point position ascertain number troops count guns bring information make general wink hope acted without orders 
would please better go permission allow lives friends hang upon chance humor russian general 
must remember andre russian soldier may therefore take upon exercise little personal liberty

would shot returned dragoon quietly 
willing shot good cause greater hero every man armies 
andre one shake hand

god knows truly say cried andre leaping enthusiasm seizing scout hand grasp powerful 
angry added petroff gentle tone tightened belt urge keep locket always remembrance 
likely ever forget auburn hair may lad may perfection world soldiering dangerous life 
andre smiled half contemptuously 
felt advice needless

disguised bulgarian rustic dobri petroff left russian camp passed outposts cover fog gained neutral ground two armies 
course sentries sides numerous well vigilant especially night 
therefore behoved advance extreme caution 
creeping mound rock bush knoll reached small clump bushes entered purpose resting minutes considering well future movements 
thrill excitement ran frame discovered alone thicket 
man sat leaning tree asleep 
scout crouched drew revolver 
moment sufficed show arrival observed 
wonder approach like cat great perplexity 
man evidently sentinel either belligerent plain equally plain armed 
shoot would impossible without putting sentries sides alert 
pass small thicket without attracting attention would difficult 
draw back would necessitate long detour involving loss precious time increase risk 
thought occurred 
many time hunted among mountains well accustomed glide serpentine caution towards game 
would stalk petroff seldom thought twice cases emergency 
unbuckled sword quietly hung branch leaned carbine tree resolving trust great personal strength alone mean sacrifice life could avoid 
case driven extremity knife revolver would suffice 
sinking became lost among deep shadows bush brake began slow laborious silent process gliding towards unconscious victim 
one ventures referred afoot foggy night 
venture points similarity though end view different 
let us turn aside little turkish camp 
round one watch fires considerable distance rear stood group turkish soldiers chatting smoking 
although noisy russians round camp fires turks means taciturn 
touch dry humor remarks sedate chuckle occasionally

bobo would preferred go alone eskiwin would take denial 
accordingly two adventurous fellows went soon lost fog

minutes sergeant corporal conversed whispers 
exceedingly tantalising friends hiss voices could distinctly heard 
eskiwin long arm could almost reached lance

dobri petroff observed much interest unmingled concern perceived new comers turks like idea seeing man murdered eyes 
thought friend petko borronow stake restrained action 
however relieved observing short turk kneeled prisoner chest kept mouth covered prevent crying tall turk quickly tied legs hands 
thus clear immediate death intended 
scout interest say nothing surprise increased followed 
short turk pointing revolver prisoner head removed hand admit speech prisoner first utterance exclamation astonishment tones familiar petroff ear

well little time spare 
petroff directed sergeant attention turks busy undoing bonds prisoner 
without saying another word scout glided swiftly forward 
promptly followed sergeant 
next moment men leaped turks throats 
eskiwin match gotsuchakoff bore back held like vice 
ali bobo strong though felt perfect baby grasp scout 
two men submitted petroff ordered low tone keep silence enforcing order touch revolver muzzle sergeant quickly bound arms behind
