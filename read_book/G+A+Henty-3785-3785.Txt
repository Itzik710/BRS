true ernest 
long feeling generally exists long wide chasm two classes always existed france would unwise perhaps one upper admit respect could equality england certain equality always allowed exist 
englishman ranks certain feeling self respect independence result shown history wars fought two nations 
france early days always relied upon chivalry 
horde footmen placed field counted little 
england upon hand relied principally upon archers pikemen must admitted beat us handsomely 
wars flanders english general marlborough infantry always proved superior 
galling admit blinking facts history 
seems feeling independence self respect english system gives rise even among lowest class must render man man better soldiers drawn peasantry whose lives mercy lords

fancy next generation adapt changed circumstances ideas ernest jules learn english lad great advantage fit new state things 
lessons gouvernante always present meal times salon evening harry communication young ladies family 
met grounds saluted boys much formal courtesy distant acquaintances returning bows deep curtsies

mother ever thank saw terrace speed sprang assistance quickness thought stripped coat threw head 
could see nothing except rolling confused mass 
hurt trust bit sir harry said

heard father doctor say man could kill biggest dog could get back kneel 
managed get knees felt right 
ah well speak nothing marquis said 
men indeed would throw way mad dog especially formidable brute 
behaved courage son saw ready give life sisters quickness readiness friend would late 
true father ernest said tone humility 
late moreover useless would torn moment fallen upon sisters 
sandwith said frankly wrong 
thought games spoke fighting rough barbarous see use

saw dog felt powerless sword rushed fight without moment hesitation trusting strength head 
yes customs made man boy still 
good say harry said quite sure would quick ready circumstances matter swords much useful glad see advantage rough english ways 
marquis put hand approvingly upon ernest shoulder addressed harry turned daughters 
governess sunk fainting ground saw danger 
virginie thrown crying loudly jeanne stood pale quiet beside 
marquis directed one men run chateau bid female servant bring water smelling salts governess lifted virginie tried soothe stretched hand jeanne

incident caused considerable change harry position family 
previously accepted consequence orders marquis 
although compelled treat equal two boys hearts looked upon inferior girls regarded sort tutor brothers thus creature altogether indifferent 
henceforth appeared different light 
ernest acted spirit words spoken time henceforth treated comrade respected well liked 
tried learn english games required two players forced abandon 
even asked teach box harry good sense make excuses 
felt ernest means match strength good would find difficult put good naturedly knocked 
therefore said could done without boxing gloves would impossible obtain france next place hardly advise learn even procured gloves contests severe bruises often given 
think nothing black eye said laughing sure madame mother would pleased see marked besides people would understand motive undertaking rough exercise might lose somewhat respect 
content count ernest excellent swordsman although improving du tillet tuition shall never match 
like sometime away observation take coats give lesson wrestling splendid exercise disadvantages boxing 
little jules looked harry hero henceforth together gave sort implicit obedience paid elder brother 
ceremonious habits age prevented anything like familiarity part younger girls jeanne virginie always greeted smile met joined conversation brothers evening

moderate men shocked headlong course events numbers commencement movement thrown heart soul shrank back dismay strange tyranny called liberty

nobles emigrated found situation intolerable hoped army would shortly raised set motion foreign powers put movement constituted danger kings nobles property europe 
yet nothing foreshadow terrible events take place indicate movement began demand oppressed people justice fair treatment would end people becoming bloodthirsty rabble eager destroy birth education intellect 
therefore although marquis de st caux foresaw possibility confiscation property abolition privileges nobility uneasiness whatever safety children

saw task getting order marie release would difficult anticipated 
hoped placing batch papers robespierre would get sign among others without reading saw would next impossible 
one thing afforded grounds satisfaction 
among papers list prisoners brought following day trial 
robespierre added two names signed sent back prison 
another list names prisoners executed following day harry learned sent prison authorities late evening even ignorant last moment prisoners called tumbrils next morning 
thus would know marie go mockery trial would also know name put fatal list guillotine 
first fact might able learn ally prison second important could obtained way 
work frequently interrupted callers

admired simplicity life affection sister birds kindness heart matters politics concerned 
among robespierre visitors next three weeks lebat harry found important personage representative committee public safety province burgundy one extreme frequenters jacobin club

harry time altogether thrown away 
duty first thing morning open sort letters lay piles upon table used robespierre managed every day slip quietly pockets several letters denunciation persons aristocrats disguise suspected hostility commune 
robespierre left go club assembly harry would write short notes warning disguised hand persons named would went leave doors 
thus satisfaction saving considerable number persons clutches revolutionists 
would two three days later slip letters denunciation dated among rest correspondence satisfied search made persons named would already shifted quarters assumed disguise 
february come harry still working waiting busy several hours day writing examining reports robespierre striving evening keep courage spirits girls calling minutes day see victor passing long terrible fever lay weak apparently unconscious alike past present mind completely gone doctor told harry respect think case hopeless 
strength seems absolutely deserted said mind blank like little child means despair gradually recovering could hear voice lady tell engaged might strike chord lying dormant set brain work

harry spoke lightly jeanne great effort recovered composure although trial danger king nightly discussed lamented never said word possibility catastrophe averted 
one day towards end february harry felt thrill run glancing list persons tried following day saw name marie daughter ci devant marquis de st caux

sooner sat village cabaret breakfast official red scarf presented asked going 
production document satisfied indeed immediately addressed young man somewhat shabby garments honor secretary great man tones greatest respect 
virginie present shy awkward attire boy indeed time night procure disguise girl would done although harry opinion would attract less attention travel boy unchanged would given way possible make change 
delay however would certainly dangerous original plan adhered
