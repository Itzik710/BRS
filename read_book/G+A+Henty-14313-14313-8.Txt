oh think man said 
keep spirits well great thing 
many boys would sit cry found scrape got

suppose boy age going cry like girl english boy would ashamed cry especially frenchmen looking 
jacques laughed good temperedly 
would nothing ashamed 
like cold english frenchman laughs sings pleased cries sorry 
oh tell ralph replied 
say halloo hurt much though try best feel sure cry like great baby 
would good jacques shrugged shoulders 
people different said 
man coward cries 
seen two boys fighting pulling hair crying time fought 
cry afraid 
pulling hair ralph repeated contemptuously 
ought ashamed 
call fighting 
call disgusting 
england even girls would hardly pull hair 
seen two three fights fishwomen dover even go like 
way french boys fight wonder soldiers sailors struck ralph remark make would altogether place present circumstances 
therefore seized opportune fit coughing turned conversation asking jacques rate thought vessel slipping water 
minutes later first mate came told jacques inform ralph captain ordered supplied clothes similar worn rest crew told take post regularly boy starboard watch 
ralph well pleased news 
felt best chance make useful board become one crew soon possible case english merchantman met captured sent crew prisoner french port 
long board various opportunities escape might present 
might slip away port brig might captured english cruiser privateer whereas lodged french prison chances good fortune befallen jacques slight indeed 
therefore turned alacrity 
would hard time bit felt sure although jacques evidently found friend saw scowling glances several men passed near national feeling told heavily 
surprising 
animosity two nations lasted long extended individuals 
englishmen despised well disliked frenchmen 
ready admit might brave considered altogether wanting personal strength 
popular belief half starved existed chiefly upon frogs hot water bits bread scraps vegetables called soup upon sea especially almost contemptible 
certainly long succession naval victories fleets afforded justification sailors opinion enemy 
fights detached vessels french showed many times point courage way inferior men indeed victories mainly due two causes 
first place superior physique stamina men result partly race partly feeding consequently able work guns faster longer could adversaries 
second place british sailor went battle absolute conviction going victorious frenchman hand although determined best win first doubts whether british would usual victorious 
probable french sailors hated us far men 
lowered national prestige defeated whenever met blockaded ports ruined trade inflicted immense damage upon fisheries subsidized nations heart center coalition france struggling maintain 
therefore surprising among hundred ten men board la belle marie many viewed ralph hostile eyes refrained personal violence owing strict order captain given well treated 
toward midday fog lifted suddenly wind freshened lookouts stationed tops 
little hope indeed english merchantmen come far toward french coast british cruisers might anywhere 
distant sails could seen far horizon proceeding channel captain la belle marie idea commencing operations much away shores england 
day vessel ran french coast although captive every mile reeled log took home ralph could help admiring speed brig slipped water cutting waves sharp bow leaving scarcely ripple behind fine clean run 
different smooth gliding motion quick plunge shock bluff bowed fishing boat accustomed 
sails scrubbed speck upon 
masts lofty tapering rigging neat trim every stay taut iron 
could fight ships better french far building rigging went vastly superiors la belle marie looked ralph almost like gentleman yacht cleanness order respects vied men war often watched heights dover 
however little time admiration kept work rubbing polishing guns brass work idle minute time came deck dressed cabin boy morning picked sunset 
two french boys age forward soon work done evening watch set began torment acting servants officers take share watch 
fortunately jacques gone time ralph boys finding taunts effect whatever upon ralph began get bolder one snatched cap jacques interfered 
look youngsters said young english boy present one crew brig right fair treatment one else warn interfere fight fairly 
know enough english boys know hands would least chance 
could thrash even little english boys wrestle tear kick hit straight men 
swords would different row would naked hands 
advise leave alone make fight see fair play 
time prisoner england well treated people treated saw french prisoners treated see treated 
voyage impossible tables turned may find prisoners hands english recommend behave way would like treated taken prisoners 
see lad good tempered willing 
stranger among us speak word language right fair treatment 
gets know language able shift mean look one plays tricks got talk 
jacques clery one powerful active men board brig assertion sufficient put stop practical joking ralph lad much easier time expected 
men finding willing work anxious oblige every way soon took paying attention talk asking french name every object board ship many days ralph found able far understand could obey orders pull haul sheet needed handling 
upon second day wind dropped sail set word given go aloft went rest although little practical use loosing gaskets soon shook first feelings discomfort nervousness seeing carelessly unconcernedly men side work many days sea quick active aloft hands board brig 
running nearly far bordeaux vessel head pointed west nightfall french coast sight 
vigilant lookout kept one man constantly stationed aloft increased animation crew ralph judged would soon arrive point course homeward bound merchantmen 
quite made mind although ready matters duty one crew la belle marie nothing induce take part fight countrymen 
soon night fell sail reduced morning eight bells ralph came deck watch found whole upper sails taken topsails lowered cap brig moving water rate two three knots hour 
guessed must upon track ships object thus taking sail catch sight vessels distance would unobserved 
course day several sail seen passing considerable distance 
either captain think safe commence operations present like look passing vessels rate made movement close nightfall sail hoisted brig proceeded course 
ralph noticed carried light even binnacle carefully shaded light could seen except helmsman 
midnight watch went deck ralph perceived sail greatly reduced noticed time time officer watch swept horizon night glass 
apparently observed nothing two clock stood time gazing intently astern 
turned gave order sailor went two three minutes later captain came deck 
speaking officer gazed intently astern 
ship course suddenly changed sheets eased half hour ran sharp angle course following brought eye wind laid 
although ralph strained eyes direction captain looking could see nothing doubt sail seen coming astern object change course let pass without seen 
rather wondered instead running wind captain put take position windward instead leeward vessel behind soon arrived object maneuver 
stars seen bank clouds overhead stretched away east horizon entirely obscured west sky lighter vessel would clearly visible eye 
brig therefore position taken could seen would obtain full view passed 
hour ship came along 
large ship full rigged french sailors come deck clustered bulwarks eagerly discussed 
two miles windward opinions differed whether man war indiaman 
ralph rather wondered privateer tried get alongside darkness take vessel surprise understood strong probability belle marie might caught tartar suddenly run guns british frigate 
soon vessel passed braces manned yards swung round brig continued course 
brought almost wind eye sailed closely possible morning broke recovered leeway made windward vessel pursuing matter much astern 
chapter iv 
privateer rendezvous 
morning broke vessel privateer watching night seen three miles directly ahead 
large vessel time opinions differed whether frigate indiaman became quite light patch two canvas showed could man war sail crowded privateer 
ship shook canvas half hour sufficed show privateer much faster vessel 
stranger took extra canvas set continued course altogether regardless privateer 
made minds fight jacques said ralph 
finds outsail us got easy working canvas 
big ship expect carries heavier metal 
may troops board 
brig kept eating windward gained position mile upon starboard quarter indiaman long pivot gun leveled first shot fired 
crew time taken places guns ralph boys brought powder shot magazine 
without struggle ralph brought saw refusal would probably cost life one else would bring cartridges place refusal would benefit countrymen 
come deck gun fired saw water thrown ship stern shot dancing away leeward 
next shot struck merchantman quarter 
moment later vessel brought wind broadside eight guns fired 
two struck hull privateer another wounded mainmast rest cut holes sails struck water quarter mile windward 
oath captain privateer brought vessel wind payed tack 
merchantman carried much heavier metal given credit 
came round redcoats seen deck 
apparently well satisfied display made strength ship bore went quietly way privateer hove preventer stays put mainmast 
ralph remained time heard men savagely cursing thought best attract attention present 
sails lowered brig drifted quietly day ten clock ralph heard creaking blocks knew sails hoisted 
half hour later watch ordered come quietly deck 
ralph went rest 
quarter hour could see nothing made dark mass hundred yards leeward immediately afterward helm put brig run toward stranger 
two minutes later sharp hail followed instantly shouts sound feet crew could gain deck prepare defense brig alongside moment later crew sprang upon decks stranger 
blows given resistance offered slight short time crew disarmed driven vessel possession privateer 
proved small bark way mediterranean 
carried twenty hands four small guns laden hardware 
privateer crew set work upon 
first ralph could understand long discovering 
wedges round mainmast knocked topmast lowered deck shrouds stays slacked mast lifted carried board brig 
soon done second mate brig eight sailors went board prize crew 
everything made taut trim brig crew 
english prisoners already disarmed battened hold prize crew hoisted sail prepared take mizzen foremast french port 
luck would reach safety way fell british privateer cruiser would course fall easy prey 
sooner bark way privateersmen set work lift injured mainmast replace brought board bark 
daylight broke anxious glances cast round horizon although distant sails seen none following course would bring near brig latter without sail foremast alone standing would likely noticed 
ralph could help admiring energy crew worked 
ordinarily means smart crew work slow slovenly manner man felt importance getting everything order enemy appeared well work midday new mast place sunset topmast yards gear sails ready hoisting 
ralph state anxiety early part night lest sent board bark carried prisoner france 
one seemed give thought far morning captain happened notice hard work rest 
ah said 
thought sent best bark 
ralph understand words guessed meaning said smiling quite content remain 
tell jacques clery noticed works willingly long behaves well shall treatment belonged really crew warn caught time making signal anything warn vessel may approaching brains blown 
jacques translated warning 
right ralph said 
course expect nothing else 
soon repairs completed sails hoisted brig proceeded way 
days followed seemed ralph tactics privateer changed longer idea making prizes 
sharp lookout indeed kept english cruisers attention paid sail distance soon determined ships war 
four days later instead five six sail sight one point horizon sea absolutely deserted 
remarked upon friend jacques 
latter laughed 
course lad 
passed latitude cape st vincent yesterday evening pretty well coast africa 
nine ten ships seen either bound mediterranean way home 
passed mouth strait shall run across many sail 
going ralph said 
well think harm telling bound south far know 
expect first shall go west try pick prizes among islands perhaps go round cape lie wait indiamen way home 
see one ships worth dozen mediterranean traders one bothered one strait channel cruisers privateers swarm one hardly fire gun without bringing us 
suppose captain would meddled indiaman thought owners would pleased prize sent soon 
bark obliged take get new mast 
would never done started long cruise badly injured spar 
think would difficult send home prizes west indies ralph said 
well see although taken islands still two three ports take prizes 
beside take best goods ship worth risk sending france burn 
one spare hands prizes better one always ship fresh hands spaniards mulattos blacks place 
case indiamen 
single laden indiaman enough pay us well trouble 
put crew thirty hands board send home 
little risk recapture till get near france 
hoist english flag happen meet anything 
ralph glad hear ship bound west indies thought opportunities escape would likely present among islands 
madeira sighted three days later running south another four five hundred miles brig bore away west 
dint getting jacques clery translate sentences french hearing nothing language spoken round ralph time begun make considerable progress language 
anxious learn sake passing away time making understood efforts greatly stimulated fact crew addressed french cuff head generally penalty failure comprehend 
consequence six weeks sailing cry land shouted lookout tops ralph able understand almost everything said reply french fluency 
brig sailed along wooded shores first island fell ralph leaning bulwarks watching deep interest objects passing 
guess thinking jacques clery said taking place quietly side 
guess feelings 
thinking escape 
take advice hurry 
well 
begin talk french understand orders good deal easier men beginning regard one may sure watched time 
see daren let go 
get one english ports five six men war us time 
suppose captain would object put ashore 
evidently taken fancy pleased way taken things smartness willingness 
beside think considers altogether prisoner 
running way channel like capturing prize think captain could see way letting go without risk would 
sharp watch kept advise hurry try escape 
must remember caught trying would shoot certainty 
hurry jacques brig hunting english vessels 
know would feel board ship capturing french craft 
yes hard doubt jacques agreed say escape get chance say wait chance good one 
present specially lookout prizes 
going join two vessels belonging owners 
time got snug hiding place somewhere though think one board except captain knows 
three weeks brig cruised among islands 
picked prizes time captain wish commence operations joined consorts obtained information british men war station 
overhauled one two native craft purchased fish fruit cautiously asked questions cruisers 
answers satisfactory 
learned owing numbers vessels captured privateers vigilant lookout kept two three french craft captured cruisers bought service constantly search headquarters privateers 
bad news although brig great spread canvas could light winds run away ships war means certain would able converted privateers 
one morning two vessels schooner brig seen coming round headland 
captain officers examined telescopes flag run masthead 
almost immediately two answering flags hoisted strangers exclamation satisfaction broke captain luck said 
run across might search rendezvous 
got spot marked chart told sailing understood difficult find entrance might pass within hundred yards without noticing 
half hour ships closed together captains crafts came board boats 
hearty greeting exchanged captain la belle marie three descended cabin 
time reappeared visitors returned respective ships 
five minutes later schooner got way la belle marie followed leaving brig continue cruise alone 
toward evening schooner ran toward precipitous cliff brig keeping close wake 
ralph doubt close spot privateers used rendezvous could detect opening cliff ahead looked schooner leading way destruction 
within cable length shore could opening discovered keenest eye 
schooner within length cliff helm put 
came round moment later disappeared 
exclamation surprise broke board brig saw instead cliff stretching unbroken line projected one point precipitous headway concealed extremely narrow passage behind 
moment later brig imitated maneuver schooner passed two lofty cliffs close yards spare either side 
fifty yards ahead channel made sharp turn entered basin tranquil water three four hundred yards across 
end shore sloped gradually several large storehouses erected ways laid convenience hauling repairing vessels 
think youngster jacques said exultantly 
grand hiding place indeed ralph replied 
might cruise outside weeks looking place find unless boat happened row along foot cliffs 
soon anchor crew given leave go ashore ramble stretch legs two months confinement board 
ralph proceeding take place one boats captain eye fell upon 
come young fellow said french 
jacques clery shall want 
think much need interpreting captain sailor said followed others cabin 
lad get fairly french certainly understand sense anything may say 
look lad captain began fairly treated since came board brig 
kindly treated ralph said 
nothing whatever complain 
saved life yes sir first nearly taking ralph said smile 
ah much fault

work willingly well makings first class seaman still understand would much rather people would rather aiding capturing us aiding us capture 
consequently see opportunity probably try escape 
shall take good care prevent shall shoot without hesitation catch 
still may escape run risk place discovered trade knocked head 
therefore offer alternative 
either give solemn oath case reveal existence place put shore charge party remain stop prisoner till sail away cruising ground may three months may year 
say answer hastily take oath unless convinced keep however great temptation held betray us 
ralph needed minute consider proposal 
oath bind way abstain making attempt escape simply guard secret privateer rendezvous 
remained shore would chance whatever escape might moreover meet rough treatment left charge 
quite ready take oath reveal secret place captain said 
think case kindly treated inclined betray 
however offer alternative ready take oath like silence oath assuredly keep whatever pressure may laid upon understood course oath way prevents taking opportunity may present making escape 
quite understood captain said 
mere matter business 
try escape shoot catch 
think likely succeed 
justice employers friends justified running even slight risk unless convinced succeed keep silence

finished meal ralph proposed climb highest point ground could find take view island 
two hours walking took top lofty hill

island judged seven eight miles across fully twice length 
several small islands lay within miles distant high land rose twenty miles 
must large island ralph said 
know jacques idea whatever sailor said suppose one board except officers 
charts captain cabin know geography islands south seas nothing 
quite right keep dark though suppose many fellows board three craft would split upon us captured see share profits voyage well regular pay course lose storehouses pretty well choked goods get taken never saying mean scamp might offered handsome reward 
fewer knows secret better 
look jacques look full rigged ship come behind island 
looks like frigate 
sailor replied

going look 
two hours steady walking took top hill 
signs vessel far could see 
captain brought glass carefully examined every island sight 
presently uttered exclamation three boats rowing together close cliffs said pointing nearest island 
doubt frigate lying behind 
must searching concealed harbor like 
peste awkward 
think jacques say right said last night captain 
must got idea rendezvous somewhere hereabouts though know certain searching island round 
come along like shall caught trap 
vessel might sail close without suspecting entrance however hard might looking send boats rowing along shore help finding 
still nothing prevent sailing away island us 
captain said 
come away first place would capture booty stores second place might lie quiet harbor would sink ships returned 
go port jacques send two men storehouse keep watch turn turn 
remain relieved 
leave glass 
anything fresh leave boy watch come news

jacques ralph watched distant boats glass disappeared round end island turned glass seaward 
jacques using time 
see exclaimed three sails together 
see plainly enough ralph said 
make schooner brig three masted vessel 
lying close together fancy boats passing 
however swear 
must fifteen miles away 
expect consorts merchantman captured 
see side island ralph asked excitedly 
say could jacques replied pausing calculate line sight 
depends far round frigate lying close shore 
sent one hill course make plainly 
jacques handed glass ralph 
yes think make boats jacques 
suppose likely transferring valuable part cargo board 
expect let go course depends whether new ship worth taking risk carrying france 
burn sink would good know crew 
course want bother prisoners want turn adrift boats 
might land island near see us going coming carry news cruisers 
expect take valuable let go ship worth sending home 
suppose case going put prize crew board send france would transferring cargo 
well shall see another half hour 
chapter v british cruisers 
hour passed 
time watchers hill saw brig lying alongside three masted vessel felt sure cargo transferred merchantman sails hoisted slowly sailed away 
another hour two crafts lay motionless hoisted sail headed island 
brisk steady wind blowing came along fast water 
shall soon see whether frigate made jacques said wait longer go tell captain going 
another hour others relieve bring latest news 
left alone ralph watched anxiously progress distant vessels turning glass frequently toward island beyond end momentarily expected see white sails frigate appear 
hour passed 
schooner brig within four miles nearest point island still signs english ship 
presently heard voices behind two french sailors came 
ralph free return thought better wait brig schooner reached point would hidden island sight one might watching hill six miles away 
another half hour reached point 
signs seen frigate ralph felt sure must anchored bay whose headland prevented seeing approaching craft noticed would assuredly set intercept reached island lay almost dead windward 
turning go one men gave sudden exclamation 
turned round saw frigate appearing behind island 
close hauled soon evident course beating point round two ships disappeared 
ralph puzzled made brig schooner natural course would made end island cut sailed past whereas would gained extremity island find five six miles astern two craft 
french sailors equally puzzled hot argument finally concluded appearance moment must accidental could made privateers 
told ralph run news harbor light thrown upon mystery end island frigate emerged large schooner appeared 
every sail set course directed toward end island upon watchers standing 
two french sailors burst torrent oaths expressive surprise alarm evident course schooner taking intended intercept two privateers engage frigate came assistance 
run boy run life one exclaimed tell captain 
wait moment directed glass upon schooner 
thousand curses exclaimed 
cerf schooner english captured us six months ago 
fastest craft waters 
tell captain coming legs beat mine 
ralph dashed full speed soon fairly distanced french sailor began run slowly 
moment entered feelings companions identified time think sympathies swung round english ship 
particularly want la belle marie captured well treated board felt ill toward 
capture meant deliverance 
thought matter ran wondered first frigate take line cut privateers instead going round end island 
could suppose schooner fastest vessel likely arrive time point 
beside showed privateers reached point might double back frigate would make end island halfway back 
might captain suspected truth knowing privateers rendezvous somewhere neighborhood object remaining long behind island give time enter port ignorance neighborhood 
rate great thing schooner brig enter little harbor knowing pursued 
would impossible get beat shore wind blowing dead land schooner frigate rounded respective ends island 
therefore although ralph ran fast enough keep well ahead sailor made effort keep greater rate speed necessary 
soon reached shore boat rowed brig fetch 
saw satisfaction although men board preparations made getting way indeed captain would anxiety ship would know privateers saw frigate coming meet would sail right away island frigate would sure pursue sight land 
news boy captain asked boat came close alongside 
frigate chase others yes sir ralph replied frigate schooner chase 
way bearing privateers know chased sir 
frigate show round island schooner brig hidden behind end island 
made toward western end schooner making eastern end 
sailors came told tell schooner cerf one fastest vessels 
captain uttered exclamation dismay echoed standing round 
row entrance shouted coxswain boat warn others danger tell make straight 
come shall caught trap together oars dipped water boat fairly motion exclamation head sail schooner glided past projecting cliff 
moment later whole vessel came view 
bring boat back alongside captain shouted 
go board 
may get time yet schooner rounded sails came headed straight toward brig 
captain belle marie stood stern sheet boat shouting waving hands gesticulating get sail 
board schooner looked surprise unable guess meaning 
two english cruisers one coming round end island shouted approached schooner 
get otherwise must catch us captain schooner saw emergency roared orders 
boats lowered men tumbled board 
hawsers lowered bows began tow head round breath wind land locked harbor 
much time got captain asked schooner head came slowly round 
know captain replied 
question minutes anyhow 
ah brig boat dashed forward gave similar orders given schooner 
get round captain shouted 
row entrance give warning accursed cruisers sight 
boat dashed narrow entrance felt full force breeze 
dead shore captain muttered bitterly 
work right arms one 
rowed hundred yards beyond furthermost point could see east sails schooner perceived 
take round captain said sharply 
late got fight 
rowed back entrance 
schooner slowly towed boats approaching 
use captain said late 
schooner rounded end island breeze half hour 
never work time 
beside would see come even got away would come back capture depot 
got fight evident boats fleet could hardly make way 
best get three craft moored broadsides entrance 
blow boats tinder try come load valuable goods slip night time 
chance 
captain schooner jumped boat rowed entrance 
saw advice one followed 
would impossible beat shore schooner came talking frigate appeared round end island 
therefore returned harbor 
belle marie anchor raised three vessels moored head stern across harbor hundred yards entrance 
soon done strong parties sent ashore vessels six heavy ship guns landed captured vessel dragged place near storehouse planted heights sweep narrow channel 
late evening finished earthwork thrown shelter men working guns musketry fire 
meantime two ships war met outside separating cruised several times end end rocky wall evidently searching entrance privateers pursuing suddenly disappeared 
morning french sailors work early two three strong chains fastened across mouth passage 
captain belle marie said exultantly regained deck ship ready give warm reception 
boats british cruisers station would never force way gap 
ralph called upon assist work preparation jacques done day work journey top hill back 
saw exultation faces frenchmen considered position impregnable shuddered thought terrible carnage would ensue boats english vessels try force entrance 
following morning lookout cliffs reported two boats left ships rowing toward shore 
reaching foot cliffs rowed along abreast distance thirty forty yards shores 
stopped rowing mouth entrance suddenly hailed captain schooner standing cliff 
try enter said destroyed 
want harm leave us alone guns enough blow whole fleet water use driven 
thank warning voice shouted back boats order given rowed back ships 
well found place lieutenant pearson captain frigate asked young lieutenant stepped deck 
yes sir found 
boat turned came 
see signs captain said examining shore telescope 
sir within hundred yards 
rowing close saw time got 
rocks overlap narrow channel fifty yards long 
apparently makes sharp turn end opens 
saw nothing vessels chasing yesterday high ground facing channel battery six guns planted rake anything coming 
chains across end 
lying oars hailed 
repeated warning given 
nasty place get eh captain said thoughtfully 
nasty sir 
see guns would play right channel chains break perhaps batteries certainly ships tackle get inside 
width frigate enter captain asked 
width say sir 
certainly get yards braced fore aft ship would go something spare say 
depth water close shore plenty depth sir right foot cliffs course say nothing depth channel 
course captain said 
well something run pests earth last see going easy matter get 
captain signaled captain schooner come board two officers retired cabin together long consultation 
young officer coming deck got boat taking lieutenant pearson rowed cliffs hundred yards west inlet 
could obtain view channel surroundings 
man seen 
muzzles six guns pointed menacingly passage chains could seen water edge 
think go back mr pearson 
really think ought much obliged fellows sinking us 
wonder motive letting us easily suppose feel pretty confident report likely encourage attack think blow us pieces would make captain wilson determined destroy 
least conclusion came rowed back last time 
yes think young captain said 
certainly awkward looking place attack boats ever saw 
course chains vessel could get dare say many time captured would risky thing take frigate without knowing anything depth water either channel inside 
returned frigate 
mr pearson report fully borne captain wilson 
would desperate enterprise attack boats 
half would sunk got chains even got past doubt saying difficulties obstacles may inside 
frigate captain chambers 
well sir decide 
quite ready take schooner though plunging power battery raking fore aft say fairly would desperate enterprise sufficient way upon carry away chains nothing could save 
frigate seems would run equal risk schooner additional danger may water enough 
well certainly seem easy nut crack captain wilson said 
agreed started justified risking vessels assaulting place certainly extremely formidable may water enough frigate float 
still question remains done use anchoring trying starve may provisions enough last years anything know 
weather turn bad make would never caught hurricane coast lee 
might send port royal letter admiral asking send us two three ships like mere question capturing two rascally privateers 
think admiral would glad send younger captain said two vessels done tremendous lot damage last year 
believe upward twenty ships reported boarded stripped 
came could captain wilson asked 
see consider worth risk throwing away two ships two force passage still less would risk four 
doubt captain chambers agreed 
suggest however many us may draw keep watch distance 
course would necessary approach night lie behind island somewhere daytime yesterday top hill see distance round 
yes soon dusk two three hours get away come round 
beside night glasses top cliffs sure able make us 
one way see getting find landing place attack shore 
ah much hopeful business 
far saw yesterday cliffs round island hard indeed find place manage effect landing 
plan must follow 
afternoon hour gets dark get sail make away bound port royal 
shall keep station 
think gone get ships 
soon thoroughly dark bear round come back island bring schooner close cliffs side get bay find one 
sight altogether unless somebody happens look edge cliffs 
search whole back island boats keeping oar length cliffs 
must places man climb probably gulleys worn streams 
morrow night sail round join us 
waiting two miles land show light seaward know find 
talk matters get back side morning 
captains two english vessels holding consultations similar talk going three captains privateers conclusion arrived precisely similar english officers 
agreed attack likely made ships would almost certainly sunk plunging fire battery came along channel assault boats would sheer madness 
wait tire captain schooner said rubbing hands 
first gale north must run shelter come back station shall gone 
course load well beforehand really worth taking away let pleasure destroying rest gone 
know well captain la belle marie said 
never fools enough try starve us quite mistaken think danger 
danger others asked 
agreed attack us channel 
attack us channel attack us somewhere else know 
find place land take us rear 
exclamation dismay broke captains 
sapriste never thought 
course 
never examined coast side must places could land 
doubt may quite sure course adopt 
english slow fools bet ten one next move 
like take score men cross island afternoon morrow examine whole line shore 
one two places land may able defend four five places far apart force sufficient hold could land two hundred fifty men two ships perhaps hundred 
best thing done vipon 
course send us word across directly see land lies 
find land good many places nothing us try make bolt 
keeping close cliffs night may manage give slip case one two us may get away 
better run risk caught like rats trap 
hour afterward captain belle marie started side island twenty picked men carrying arms axes two days provisions 
rest crews employed day filling three vessels valuable portion booty storehouses care taken fill vessels deeply would interfere seriously sailing powers 
arrangement made captains belle marie transfer cargo first vessel worth sending france captured receiving share one third value reached port safely 
captain belle marie well content arrangement storehouses contained spoils upward twenty ships share would therefore considerable one would carry cargo till fell english merchantman 
speculation british schooner whereabouts put end next morning message captain vipon saying discovered lying close cliffs back island boats already examining shore 
hour later captain arrived 
feared said joined captains three bays two miles apart landing could easily effected 
land slopes gradually edge sea 
might land course guns schooner would cover landing opposed 
still might beat back one others said 
muster three hundred men us likely land 
think would good plan captain vipon said 
begin tell three places may choose landing 
certainly hurry woods anything like fast row along shore would place us disadvantage 
second place know well rely upon men defeating equal number john bulls last place gain much 
lose tremendous lot men schooner would go fetch two three ships war end must beat us 
think question better us take chances escape 
either schooner come back night tow boats frigate round side island send boat news found landing place frigate send boats 
think attack take place night may made 
certainly schooner comes round wind light 
leave anchorage quite dark time got round frigate boat crews ready start get back island morning 
send boat would reach frigate three hours rowing give hour get ready start three hours row back brings nearly thing 
beside suppose case would land morning would run risk losing way woods 
proposal two clock morning make start separate soon get harbor shift 
frigate half crew away short handed smart sails able work half guns outside two three us ought get safely 
suppose schooner happens round make minds wait day attacking two us schooner sails like witch 
thought captain vipon said 
idea put man top cliff schooner anchored 
lying light fire short distance back edge cliff 
another man top hill 
sees fire shall show lantern three times 
return signal let know see 
schooner goes away early evening lookout light fire sees returning whatever hour may 
moment see light set sail 
two signallers one captains said 
would left behind might get chance rejoining us 
thought captain vipon said 
english lad board picked channel 
smart lad working one crew 
would course glad stay behind give chance rejoining friends 
would capitally 
man see showed would made prisoner sent england show might island years got chance joining french ship 
would need high bribe induce anybody run risk 
evident silence two three minutes captain vipon spoke 
man would likely one else think taken strong fancy young english boy 
good hand like losing still thing important hesitate 
still must offer something good run risk rather certainty imprisonment 
propose name shall put books three ships ever gets back france fair certainty good lot prize money hard luck two three us manage get back safely 
captains agreed 
half hour captain vipon said 
men sitting meal came away ordered make way back soon done 
refuses way see men cast lots course whoever stays would get three shares agreed 
half hour later twenty men arrived side island 
soon came board captain vipon called jacques cabin told would necessary leave two men behind explaining duties would perform 
jacques said finished thought perhaps would likely man board three ships volunteer work 
volunteer jacques said astonishment 
make think thing captain reason jacques settled leave english lad one signallers 
course gladly undertake job enable join friends land like likes might able make things easy 
second place determined name whoever stops shall borne ship books three vessels end cruise would good bit money coming even one three ships gets back enough set life three get back safely 
course may spell imprisonment likely one least ships may caught going night happened would get prison without prize money 
jacques agreed

plenty think 
another twelve hours would friends reason complain treatment received board privateer remained might returned france couple years would difficulty crossing england beside painful men fighting country prize taken instead causing delight comrades would source pain

daytime frigate cruised backward forward easy sail two miles entrance sailors believed night came much closer shore lookout night glasses reported seen twice within quarter mile entrance channel 
half hour passed without sign frigate aware ships leaving harbor ralph heard sound distant musket shot followed several others doubt one frigate boats watch near channel discovered 
minutes later flash distance sea followed interval deep boom gun came broadside followed steady fire heavy guns 
evidently fired board frigate answering sounds french ships meeting ear 
could see direction flashes frigate way 
firing continued two hours becoming distant ceased altogether 
sun rose saw frigate twenty miles away 
smaller craft two three miles two others visible ten twelve miles away west

herbert penfold dead 
heart beat kindly silenced forever 
long time mrs conway recovered sufficiently emotion take letter

thought barely occurred loss might make material difference circumstances allowance herbert penfold made doubtless intended continue receive would cease 
secondary consideration present gave trouble 
ralph thought 
ralph herbert 
plans latter made plans given happiness last year life known little happiness shattered mind even loss ralph would suffer 
may destroyed said last find takes life 
week later two letters arrived 
one mrs withers

however able point manner search carried shall happy aid matter clearly duty endeavor obtain mabel fortune herbert penfold willed 
mr tallboys tells us clear misses penfold quite determined upon line conduct

miss penfold always spokesman two sisters said shortly never seen want see know brother placed indeed aught knew might torn 
hiding places knew hiding place whose existence could accordance dictates conscience divulge 
present mrs conway 
believe mr tallboys going try get copy possession admitted circumstances proof herbert penfold intentions 
owned us thought doubtful whether able especially herbert stated intended make alterations would quite possible court might take view first place alterations might extensive affect whole purport second place might come conclusion would easier make whole afresh destroyed one 
mrs conway laid letter thinking time opened handwriting unknown

ralph reply came due time fortnight afterward mrs conway letter first go coach london two days journey mail liverpool sailing packet across dublin cork coach 
already written expressing regret news mr penfold death 
dear mother began 
awfully good talk making allowance 
say course think refusing though would thought payment would slightest way inconvenience 
say away make something like sum difference expenses must course let like thank heartily 
could really got well without 
fancy good many men regiment nothing pay manage well reason could manage 
course war times things kept expensively lots men get commissions would done army half present size considered gentlemanly profession instead real fighting machine 
however say great deal pleasant nine shilling day live instead four sixpence 
getting capitally 
course lot drill much laugh sometimes sergeant fierce little man gets wild rages blunders 
say blunders course stapleton drilled recruits 
however think another week shall shall begin learn work officer 
jolly set fellows always fun 
always thought fellows got men rather serious seems ever much fun among school 
course newcomers get worried little school 
got well see school privateer learned take things good temperedly fellows see ready fun soon give bothering 
stapleton lot trouble see look things seriously 
think getting little better used get quite mad first course made fellows ever much worse 
would find door screwed went back mess soon found awfully particular boots filled full water one night 
one got ladder threw lot crackers bedroom middle night stapleton came rushing night shirt sword drawn swearing would kill somebody 
course done get leave alone really good fellow explained never school chance learning keep temper 
getting think soon left alone 
awfully long letter enough candle left get bed 
anyhow mother bit upset losing mr penfold allowance worry 
weeks passed 
mr tallboys wrote failed induce court accept copy admission forced make mr penfold intended make alteration fatal 
however obtained order authorizing thoroughly search house take wainscotting pull floors might appear likely conceal hiding place 
fortnight later wrote announce failure 
miss penfolds said indignant left house altogether may believe ransacked top bottom 
four carpenters two masons think tapped every square foot wall house took wainscotting wherever slightest hollow sound lifted lots flooring even wrenched several hearthstones could find nothing whatever except staircase leading behind wainscotting mr penfold room door covered ivy concealed view bushes left house ivy evidently undisturbed fifty years passage even known mr penfold certainly used time 
truly regret dear madam search unsuccessful say could done done 
concealed somewhere shadow doubt unless course torn 
give opinion indeed matter women concerned judgment probabilities much likely correct mine 
expected business connection family come end 
miss penfolds appointed another agent written requesting hand papers connected property 
course shall 
need hardly say case could consented act consider unlawful possessors property 
conclusion say services times disposal 
mrs conway scarcely disappointed receipt letter quite made mind would found 
women clearly made minds deprive ralph mabel rights unless felt perfectly satisfied search would discover hiding place would improbably taken either destroyed concealed fresh place searchers would never likely look 
think likely therefore hiding place would discovered felt assured discovered would found empty 
well said quiet determined voice laid letter 
mr tallboys failed 
shall take matter 
dare say think miss penfold mistress beyond dispute herbert property 
see battle begun 
last tell lives mine 
week later altogether unexpected event took place 
mr mrs withers breakfast letter arrived mr littleton solicitor miss penfolds 
upon opening found contain offer upon part miss penfolds settle sum hundred year life upon mabel upon condition allowance would stopped upon marriage unless marriage received approval writing miss penfolds 
letter addressed mr withers reading passed wife without word 
surprised say anything moment especially mabel room laid letter beside breakfast mabel gone 
well james think asked 
think replied 
mrs withers hesitated said well james sort thing requires much thinking scarcely time turn mind yet especially mabel eating breakfast opposite idea letter contained anything importance 
would really rather hear think 
mr withers remained silent went course would nice thing mabel provision life 
slight smile passed across mr withers face wife saw way looked 
like men james said little pettishly 
ask us think things perfectly made minds mean whether agree 
think often case us 
still want see whether matter would struck light see perceive 
well james let hear view matter 
dare say shall agree tell 
well amy mr withers said seriously appears accept offer mabel 
mrs withers looked little blank 
living rich one assured mr penfold intended provide mabel endeavored lay anything freely dispensed surplus income among sick needy parish 
disappearance disappointed hopes raised many anxious thoughts mrs withers mind respecting mabel future offer contained letter therefore filled pleasure 
greatly valued husband judgment therefore replied dear well see wife thoroughly agreed ladies depriving mabel fortune herbert penfold left 
concealing destroyed present may call fraudulent possession property 
think circumstances accept favor hands 
would practically acquiesce consider robbery child acceptance would course involve renewal friendly relations thing believing acting wickedly would distasteful extreme say impossible 
course right dear mrs withers said rising seat going kissing husband tenderly 
thought light 
fact hardly thought except would nice see mabel provided 
would nice dear 
surely need anxious 
may hope make happy marriage 
may hope may spared long enough make provision course must curtail expenses lay much 
lastly dear need anxious trust god provide enabled 
even sure taken together would rather leave hands accept money wrongfully obtained condone abominable action 
another point matter looked 
see curious condition propose annuity shall forfeited unless marry sanction 
propose condition sure know james course never give sanction marriage unless approved choice surely miss penfolds would disapprove choice approved well might dear 
know bitterly disliked ralph conway resented hall 
quite possible may idea herbert views mabel determined shall benefit mabel one penny brother property clause specially designed case two young people ever come together may able stop rate stop annuity 
interpretation give condition 
likely james 
really women seem get detestable every day 
mr withers smiled wife vehemence 
still another reason take money 
ralph conway much defrauded mabel mother see letters determined sit quietly wrong 
means slightest idea think remote probability ever succeed finding 
tallboys appears made thorough search house opportunity searching done 
still clearly something mind 
intends make attempt discover found benefit mabel equally son 
therefore regard friend ally 
accept money mabel fact acquiescing wrong done done ralph 
fact going enemy 
could take money even tacitly connive efforts find 
agree entirely james 
would impossible wish said letting foolish say thought ought take 
say dear mr withers said smiling 
gave expression first natural thought mother would nice thing mabel 
given matter consideration quite sure soon thought matter would see light 
think send reply put matter mabel 
doubt whatever answer time ought know offer made 
chapter ix 
mr tallboys visitor 
mr withers fully justified conviction need doubt view mabel would take miss penfold offer 
girl hitherto entire ignorance missing interest 
called garden much surprised father told sit mother wished serious talk 
know little mabel began narrow escape heiress heiress papa mean lot money yes coming day fortune 
mr penfold time ago confided mother intention dividing property equally ralph conway 
penfold estates papa house everything yes dear 
everything including large sum money accumulated years mr penfold spending third income 
meant papa going heiress simply dear mr penfold left property ralph missing 
mr withers told whole story loss search made strong grounds believing existence secret place hall place concealment known mr penfold sisters 
surely could never wicked papa 
always seemed like much know thought quiet ladylike enough 
still think really disliked 
think way liked mabel perhaps mr penfold half left property divided half would found 
certainly like ralph conway 
disliked partly doubt principally account wrong believe mother 
human nature mabel may forgive wrong done hard forgive person wronged 
anyhow convinced prevent mrs conway son getting money get concealed rather refuse point place concealment 
seem hard papa mr penfold left everything ralph nothing sisters 
miss penfolds comfortable income mabel brother might well thought occasion beside although lived house indeed managed mr penfold know strong reason believe ruined life 
matter need go 
well mabel miss penfolds given proof dislike 
read letter think ought know written tell reasons mother think offer accepted 
mabel listened silence father finished arguments used wife exception relating miss penfolds motives putting condition concerning mabel marriage 
ceased speaking exclaimed indignantly course papa could take money ten times much could look mrs conway ralph face beside could speak people one believes done wicked thing well mabel 
quite sure would agree us time thought right refused offer know made 
whatever sentiments subject might justified refusing without knowledge offer might worldly point view interest accept 
papa mabel said would rather go weed turnips watch sheep like girls village touch penny miss penfolds money 
short time mr tallboys clerk brought letter private office 
lady asked give sir 
solicitor opened 
contained card 
show lady 
madam glad pleasure making acquaintance 
suppose staying mr withers mr tallboys hotel 
arrived hour since packet dover 
dear 
afraid unpleasant voyage 
pleasant mrs conway said quietly 
preferred long journey coach london 
five days way vessel put many ports 
still quite minor question 
wanted see talk personally 
saying whose hands letters may fall one talk face face good score letters 
mr tallboys looked rather surprised idea flashed across mind business mrs conway could want see must proposal raising money upon security annuity 
presume mr tallboys hear thoroughly convinced mr penfold existence hidden somewhere hall yes think mrs conway 
supposing destroyed 
think likely destroyed mr tallboys well say solicitor said gravely 
course thought much matter 
one naturally vexed much several reasons 
first place mr withers good enough place matter hands authorize act always sort vexation professional man clients lose cause especially convinced right 
second place much disturbed wishes late client mr penfold carried 
thirdly feel somewhat blame matter represent mr penfold imprudence placing valuable papers place anything happen suddenly might found 
course could anticipated hostile action part miss penfolds 
still blame warn mr penfold possibility fact happened taking place 
lastly smiled personal feeling matter 
lost business added somewhat considerably income 
think us thought blaming matter mr tallboys 
sure 
could possibly foreseen mr penfold sisters likely turn thieves 
well rather strong expression mrs conway though natural enough must admit position mr ralph conway mother 
see difference concealing disclosing 
mr penfold concealed 
miss penfolds simply refuse assist us search 
nearest heirs take possession property 
quite mrs conway 
defending conduct morally dishonest extreme doubt whether court law would find punishable offense 
well mr tallboys want let know whether suspect destroyed suppose would punishable offense 
certainly destruction order destroyed might get possession property would criminal 
well know thought every sense think balance probability destroyed 
first place miss penfolds doubtless consider securely hidden little chance discovered 
know fact although ransacked house top bottom pulled wainscoting lifted floors tried every imaginable point either men working suspected likely spot hiding place succeed finding 
noticed ladies times somewhat peculiar ideas morality apt steer close wind 
miss penfolds may consider perfectly justified declining give us assistance finding soothing consciences reflection refusal committing offense law takes cognizance might shrink absolutely criminal offense destroying 
say entered upon path would destroy thought chance discovered 
say thinking absolutely safe unlikely perform act discovered would bring power law 
may consider free believe actually believe try convince aught know brother may destroyed prove whether 
upon grounds therefore seems probable still existence acknowledge far utility concerned might well destroyed mr penfold sisters 
well mr tallboys doubt thinking might well expressed opinion paper troubled unnecessarily making journey lips 
well yes mrs conway deny mind 
would useless make journey mr tallboys 
glad heard opinion agrees exactly formed scarcely object eliciting made journey 
proceed part subject 
agree probably still existence hidden somewhere hall 
next question found ah difficult question indeed mrs conway 
yes difficult think impossible 
done best mr tallboys failed 
suggestion offer plan occurs might discover none whatever mr tallboys said decidedly 
done could fact dismissed question altogether mind 
authority court search searched fully reported failure court 
power search would certainly renewed unless upon strong grounds indeed 
suppose mr tallboys expected 
well seems done power us clients relinquished search time us us take matter hand 
mr tallboys looked surprised 
quite understand mrs conway take hand 
well tell mr tallboys going 
going sit quietly see son robbed inheritance 
quite made mind devote life matter come ask advice dare say would try dissuade resolution unalterable ask give aid matter 
shall glad give aid way mrs conway point direction assistance use 
suppose formed sort plan see direction whatever set matter 
intention mr tallboys search hiding place 
mr tallboys raised eyebrows surprise 
search mrs conway propose gain admittance hall even supposing gain admittance propose done even much fresh disturbance fabric house would question quite admit 
still know hiding place morally certain hiding place opened approached touching secret spring 
pulling wainscoting pulling floors force used way found 
mr penfold would seem used habitually depository papers value 
certainly therefore break pull anything 
opened would open cabinet cupboard means key touching spring 
agree far mr tallboys certainly mrs conway 
doubt mind hiding place whether chamber small closet opened way speak 
well looked spring 
force requisite done find spring 
yes found believe tried every square foot building 
doubt necessary try every square inch say whole building certain rooms passages 
think may assume upper rooms servants quarters 
hiding place would contrived could used owners house without observation dependants would therefore either drawing room dining room principal bed chambers passages corridors stairs adjoining 
quite follow reasoning mrs conway agree 
doubtless place situated may call handy owners hall still see going set finding 
going set going live hall 
going live hall mrs conway possible circumstances say last person miss penfolds would present invite take residence 
agree idea identity intend shall 
plan go capacity servant 
shall examine say every square inch rooms places hiding place likely exist 
every knob knot inequality kind wood work stone work shall pressed pulled twisted find 
aware task may occupy months even years course opportunities limited 
still whether months years intend undertake carry life spared time thoroughly completely carry 
mr tallboys silent sheer astonishment 
realty mean think going servant mrs conway certainly replied calmly 
suppose work harder women whereas ten twelve pounds year shall fortune 
see slightest difficulty objection part business 
shall course let house dover making arrangements son letters forwarded letters posted dover 
shall satisfaction engaged upon work income accumulating benefit 
see difficulty whatever plan carried 
assistance wish give 
could perhaps readily given mr withers naturally would know personally servants hall majority doubtless belong village 
mr withers clergyman might conscientious scruples taking part scheme however righteous ends must conducted would consider underground methods involving certain amount deceit 
rate think better neither mrs withers complicity whatever plans 
therefore come 
want first place find vacancy likely caused servant leaving secondly vacancy likely occur vacancy manufactured inducing servant leave present year wages would probably accomplish thirdly vacancy must occur case servant whose work would naturally lie part building examine finally must arranged recommended insure getting place 
mr tallboys silent time 
certainly plan appear feasible mrs conway said length 
seem installed way propose hall prepared spend say months even years search possible even probable end may light upon spring open mystery 
must prepared face much unpleasantness 
time associate servants menial work relinquish luxuries appliances life accustomed possibly fail last 
still prepared face appear possibility enterprise crowned success 
thought mr tallboys quite prepared submit sacrifices mention however scarcely felt sacrifices working shall future son 
rely upon assistance shall assistance give assuredly mrs conway 
matter means simple one still see reason successfully carried 
must take time quite anticipate mr tallboys 
time fortunately consequence 
well mrs conway mr tallboys said sitting minutes thought matter require careful thinking 
long intend staying long necessary mrs conway said day month 
given name george shall known mrs brown 
saw sent card envelope even clerk aware mrs conway weymouth 
solicitor said suddenly surely miss penfolds knew old time certainly 
begin nearly twenty years ago course changed much since 
much mrs conway lawyer said pleasure seeing went hall see mr penfold business 
say known anywhere card remembered came room indeed excuse saying might pass anywhere thirty 
much better purpose present mrs conway replied 
thirty well age housemaid hall 
imagine miss penfolds would prefer woman age young girl beside see must upper housemaid order charge part house want examine 
knowing first place miss penfolds advantage receiving card second place difficult woman alter appearance unrecognizable another seen twenty years 
hair good deal darker wore altogether differently

king france fled 
moment silence major leaped feet 
three cheers gentlemen present joined hearty cheer 
sudden silence fell upon 
first idea struck man news meant taking field another stirring campaign 
dismal thought occurred regiment orders america 
soon found expression words 
major surely sending us across atlantic news arrived 
powers never permit work undone napoleon mount throne france 
short time europe blaze england take field greater portion wellington army scattered world america india colonies 
believe half dozen old fighting regiments available even ranks half filled raw recruits 
almost regiments home mere skeletons

certainly counter orders reached colonel evening 
suppose anything decided upon time 
powers exchange notes hold councils spend weeks talk make mind whether anything done long come decision subject shall side atlantic possibly trials monotony perhaps two months voyage may land fetched back 
quite agree england put nothing worth calling army field would madness send fine regiment country present moment 
everyone knows lack wisdom governed miserable slowness military authorities 
likely even occur one countermand orders certainly disgusting extreme start present moment 
beside another officer said maddening two months sea without news know perhaps europe arms tremendous events going altogether

every country europe disbanding armies since peace proclaimed long time ready take field anything like force 
even napoleon great organizer take time put france arms

still might well spring escaped notice 
rate ground must gone 
spring might lie among carved work bookcases

evidently first work done 
mantel supports richly carved woodwork

first place however carry work laying aside determinately thought missing began dust sweep 
end hour happened turn round saw miss penfold standing doorway 
heard footstep decided mind would necessary extremely careful search moment miss penfold might look upon without warning 
nearly finished anna miss penfold asked 
take another hour least dust woodwork properly miss penfold

need done occasionally 
gave approving glance round noticed new housemaid carefully placed every article exact place found 
mrs conway gathered brooms dusters left room miss penfold carefully locking door 
something done mrs conway said think save immense deal trouble 
morrow measure rooms next 
passage runs along side hardly possible receptacle wall thick enough place size

following morning measured dining room known housekeeper room years gone called still room following day slipped doors soon came downstairs took outside measurement side house marking string position width window 
make plan compare figures 
found back bookcase taken books ascertain depth panel dining room thickness two feet library housekeeper room fully five feet unaccounted 
deep old fashioned fireplaces back back even allowing six inches depth would accounted either side fireplaces would wide space 
certainly cupboards visible library bookcases extended fireplace wall side 
housekeeper room cupboards side chimney piece shallow nine inches depth therefore behind considerable space unaccounted 
evident mrs conway first search must lie direction 
might lie two chambers three feet wide eight feet long 
mrs conway spirits rose discovery sighed impatiently thought another month must elapse could even commence search 
brooding matter continually one point escape 
old hiding places made either conceal proscribed priests hunted fugitives constructed greatest care 
easily discovered spot hidden room might situated would discovered ease search fugitives would naturally well acquainted positions hiding places would likely situated 
moment looked cupboard shallowness would suggest must wide empty space behind setting work axes picks crowbars would soon discover force secret trying penetrate stratagem 
reflection considerably damped hopes thought possibly easily discoverable hiding place might access much difficult trace another lying 
rate determined find secret entrance little rooms found empty would disheartened would search found either secret closet might placed entrance perhaps larger hiding place 
subsequent search outside showed existed several small iron gratings six inches long three deep close soil border 
doubt intended give ventilation underneath floors two feet outside level one might also afford ventilation underground chamber 
three months passed occasion visits room devoted time examination carved woodwork round fireplace bookcases without making discovery whatever became evident far closer search would needed short hasty examination dared make possibility moment miss penfold might appear door

becoming serious mrs conway mr tallboys said gravely 
nothing terrible could happen beyond turned house even discovered really found night suppose intention work night library false key possession might arrested attempt theft could clear explaining magistrates motive acting would give rise much unpleasant talk would render pursuance plan impossible might improbably induce women destroy already done
