well daresay could done without answer 
see picture plainly still 
sitting low chair nursery fire one knee supported locked hands meanwhile mrs fursey needle grated monotonous regularity thimble 
moment knocked small soul first time problem life 
suddenly without moving said take rasping click needle thimble ceased abruptly 
took child talking took mamma

vision refused bedroom window presented imagination 
saw stork perplexed annoyed looking sometimes seen tom pinfold look fish holding tail sniffed anna kitchen door shut face 
would stork also gone away thoughtfully scratching head one long compass like legs muttering 
incidentally fell wondering stork carried 
garden often watched blackbird carrying worm worm though doubt really safe enough always appeared nervous uncomfortable 
wriggled squirmed like fashion would stork taken possibly mrs fursey cottage nearest 
felt sure mrs fursey would taken next first house village lived mr chumdley cobbler lame sat day hammering boots dirty hands little cave half ground whole appearance suggesting poor spirited ogre 
hated little boy 
possibly nobody would taken 
grew pensive thinking rejected village 
would stork done left hands speak 
reflection prompted fresh question 
nurse come told often

stork get mrs fursey paused quite long replying 
possibly reflecting whether answer might make unduly conceited 
eventually must decided run risk opportunities could relied upon neutralising effect

comed goned worked particular favorites mine 
mrs fursey passed grammar dignified silence 
pointedly requested trouble part education mother holding diverging opinions upon subject confused child 
came heaven repeated mrs fursey go heaven good

sudden opening shutting door dark room came childish brain feeling something somewhere must need could something felt belonged belonged something much part 
feeling came back childhood though could never put words 
years later son portuguese jew explained thought

little turned aside lane stood corner listening till last echo joyous voices died away stone still remains standing sat sobbed 
would walk streets always till late 
dreaded echoing clang little front door closed behind climbing silent stairs solitude waited empty room 
would rise come towards like living thing kissing cold lips 
often unable bear closeness presence would creep streets 
even though followed alone 
sometimes would pace whole night sharing outcasts city slept 
occasionally nightly wanderings would come moments exaltation fear fell blood would leap joy prospect fierce struggle opening 
ghostly city sighing round seemed dead living thing real among world shadows 
long echoing streets would laugh shout 
misunderstanding policemen would turn bull eyes gruffly give practical advice knew stood center vast galanty show phantom houses came went shone bright lights doors open little figures flitted tiny coaches glided fro manikins grotesque pitiful crept across star lit curtain

city grim vast stretched round endless 
crawled mere atom within folds helpless insignificant absurd 
houseless forms shared vigil fellows 
animalcule upon bosom saw heeded 
company would mingle ragged men frowsy women ageless youths gathered round red glow coffee stall 
rarely would speak one another 
like animals browsed sipping halfpenny cup hot water colored coffee grounds least warm munching moist slab coarse cake looking dull indifferent eyes upon wretchedness others 
perhaps two would whisper listless monotonous tone broken short mirthless laugh shivering creature yet case hardened despair seek perhaps relief curses none heeded 
later faint chill breeze would shake shadows loose thin wan light streak dark air shade silently stealthily would fade away disappear
