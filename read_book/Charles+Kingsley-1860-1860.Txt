ever since april last playing hide seek length breadth england lying quiet till expected news ireland give cue great rising west sweep throne stiff necked persecuting excommunicate reprobate illegitimate profligate usurper falsely called queen england 
stoutly persuaded days real baconian contempt results sensible experience heart england really british nation point returning bosom catholic church giving elizabeth led chains feet rightful lord creation old man seven hills 
fair hope skipping front centuries always step farther like place rainbow touches ground used announce times language terrified old mr leigh 
one day indeed eustace entered father private room usual visit mill could hear voices high dispute parsons usual blustering mr leigh peevishly deprecating campian really sweetest natured men trying pour oil troubled waters 
whereat eustace good cause course stopped outside listened 
excellent sir said mr leigh presence show affected toward holy cause catholic faith meanwhile forget englishman 
england said parsons heretic schismatic babylon whereof written come people lest partaker plagues 
yea country arbitrary division territory princes world naught come naught

take care sir god sake take care said mr leigh 
right wrong language used house

meanwhile dear brother parsons perhaps see expediency altering tactics somewhat 
thereupon long conversation began two sent together wise method order obedience precept two better one order campian might restrain parsons vehemence parsons spur campian gentleness act supplement also must confessed gave advice pretty nearly contradictory fellow occasion require without danger writers seeming changeable inconsistent 
upshot conversation day two time mr leigh eustace also made amende honorable matters went smoothly enough father campian asked father francis household chaplain allow especial favor hear eustace usual confession ensuing friday 
poor father francis dared refuse great man assented inward groan knowing well intent worm family secrets whereby power would diminished jesuits increased 
regular priesthood jesuits throughout england toward state armed neutrality wanted little moment become open war james first time meek missionaries gentle moral tortures literally hunted death poor popish bishop hippopotamus say london time 
however campian heard eustace confession putting questions may easily conceived know anything confessional discovered satisfactorily enough campian would called love though question much propriety term applied facts poor prurient campian discovered indeed knew discover seeing swine eye pearls 
found enough smiled set work next vigorously discover lady might 
frankly said eustace feel desires reasonable lawful possible help heart soul might young man secret heart saved hour trouble course took instinctively crooked suspicious method expected find case worst possible man bound trained take lowest possible view human nature consider basest motives mainspring human action began moral torture accordingly series delicate questions poor eustace dodged every possible way though knew good father cunning must give last 
nevertheless like rabbit runs squealing round round weasel whose jaws knows must jump last force fascination parried parried pretended stupid surprised honorably scrupulous even angry every question married single catholic heretic english foreign brought tormentor step nearer goal 
last campian finding business bad one asked something worldly wealth eustace saw door escape sprang
