shot rang 
seeing laevsky remained standing fall looked direction shout come saw deacon 
pale face wet hair sticking forehead cheeks wet muddy standing maize bank smiling rather queerly waving wet hat 
sheshkovsky laughed joy burst tears moved away xx little afterwards von koren deacon met near little bridge

theological conversation taking place duhan laevsky driving home thinking dreadful driving daybreak roads rocks mountains wet dark uncertain future seemed like terrible abyss one could see bottom raindrops hanging grass stones sparkling sun like diamonds nature smiling joyfully terrible future left behind 
looked sheshkovsky sullen tear stained face two carriages ahead von koren seconds doctor sitting seemed though coming back graveyard wearisome insufferable man burden others buried 
everything thought past cautiously touching neck fingers 
right side neck small swelling length breadth little finger felt pain though one passed hot iron neck 
bullet bruised 
afterwards got home strange long sweet day began misty forgetfulness 
like man released prison hospital stared long familiar objects wondered tables windows chairs light sea stirred keen childish delight known long long years 
nadyezhda fyodorovna pale haggard could understand gentle voice strange movements made haste tell everything happened seemed likely scarcely heard understand know everything would curse kill listened stroked face hair looked eyes said nobody sat long garden huddled close together saying nothing dreaming aloud happy life future brief broken sentences seemed never spoken length eloquently

scoundrels said zina shuddering 
father remembered olivier daughter well 
used say remarkably beautiful eccentric 
imagine divinity student done stirred peasants daughter heart 
perhaps divinity student one traveling incognito 
zina grew thoughtful story divinity student beautiful french girl evidently carried imagination far away 
seemed pyotr mihalitch changed least last week except little paler 
looked calm usual though come brother visit vlassitch 
pyotr mihalitch felt change taken place 
living home could spoken anything feel equal asking simple question like question seemed awkward unnecessary

pyotr mihalitch felt expecting something though hardly knew felt unbearably sorry 
walked horse submissive faces lost thought deep conviction unhappy could happy love seemed melancholy irreparable mistake 
pity sense could nothing help reduced state spiritual softening ready make sacrifice get rid painful feeling sympathy

moon rising reflected streak red side pond 
low rumbles thunder distance 
pyotr mihalitch looked steadily water imagined sister despair martyr like pallor tearless eyes would conceal humiliation others 
imagined child imagined death mother funeral zina horror proud superstitious old woman would sure die grief 
terrible pictures future rose background smooth dark water among pale feminine figures saw weak cowardly man guilty face 
hundred paces right bank pond something dark standing motionless man tall post pyotr mihalitch thought divinity student killed thrown pond

pyotr mihalitch rode along bank pond looked mournfully water 
thinking life came conclusion never said acted upon really thought people repaid way 
whole life seemed dark water night sky reflected water weeds grew tangle 
seemed nothing could ever set right
