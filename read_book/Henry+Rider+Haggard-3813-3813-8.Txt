constituted cicely chief attendant although lady quite well strong persecuted advice noxious mixtures brewed till emlyn descending like storm hunted room cast medicines window 
sisters thus interested small matter indeed wonderful seeing lives secluded since lady cicely came amongst ten times

none allowed enter nunnery save silent old monk confessed celebrated mass order abbot suffered go abroad upon business whatsoever 
rest means communication dwelt beyond surly gardener deaf set spy little news ever reached

understand least 
discipline suggested whatever might faults frailty declared vigor entirely unsuited case lady cicely opinion suffered much small cause moreover become mother therefore treated every gentleness 
part washed hands whole business rather enforce commands would lay case vicar general london understood ready look matters 
least would set lady harflete servant outside gates call upon charitable assist 
course however lordship chose send skilled woman wait upon trouble could objection provided woman person good repute 
circumstances idle talk bread water dark cells scourgings 
things never happen prioress

moreover said sworn shepherds devil horns hoofs mounted jackass seen driving lambs 
next ghost sir john foterell appeared clad armor sometimes mounted sometimes afoot always night time 
first dreadful spirit perceived walking gardens shefton hall met abbot caretaker place shut went set springe hares 
man advanced years yet horses ever covered distance shefton blossholme abbey quickly night 
would return charge henceforth shefton left dwelling ghost might see time time shone window places like candle 
moreover said ghost traveled far wide dark windy nights knocked upon doors lifetime tenants hollow voice declared murdered abbot blossholme underlings held daughter durance threats unearthly vengeance commanded men bring justice pay neither fees homage 
much terror ghost cause thomas bolle swift foot set watch returned announcing seen called name whereon bold fellow believing man sent arrow straight laughed forthwith vanished away 
proof things led abbot monks place showed stood ghost stood yes arrow feathers mysteriously burnt wood seared though fire sunk deep tree beyond 
thing become scandal dread abbot robes solemnly laid ghost thomas bolle showing exactly passed 
spirit well truly laid like foundation stone abbot monks returned homeward wood went dreadful voice recognized sir john foterell called words shadows impenetrable thicket night falling clement maldonado abbot blossholme thou didst murder summon thee meet within year throne god 
thereon fled yes even abbot fled rather said horse thomas bolle lagged behind outrunning every one getting home first saying aves went 
although whole countryside hunted sir john ghost seen 
doubtless work done abbot explained matters differently 
worse things seen however 
one moonlight night disturbance heard among cows bellowed rushed field turned milking 
thinking dogs got amongst herd watchman man would stir alone sunset blossholme went see happening presently fell half dead fright 
leaning gate laughing foul fiend fiend horns tail hand instrument like pitchfork 
pair got home never knew certain night one could milk cows moreover slipped calves became wild must slaughtered 
next came rumors even nunnery haunted especially chapel 
voices heard talking emlyn stower praying came vowing seen ball fire rolled aisle center man head seemed try talk could 
matter inquiry held abbot asked emlyn knew face ball fire 
answered thought 
seemed like one guards named andrew woods commonly drunken andrew scotchman sir christopher harflete said killed night great burning 
least lordship would remember andrew broken nose head fire appeared changed great deal since death could quite certain 
sure seemed trying give message 
recalling trick played said andrew body abbot silent 
asked shrewdly emlyn seen terrible thing came afraid alone chapel informed frequented much 
answered laugh men dreaded spirits good ill 
exclaimed burst rage dread woman witch summon shall free wizardries fire company 
replied emlyn coolly ask dead andrew message next time meet unless chooses deliver 
parted night happened worst thing 
one morning abbot whose window set open wakened voice spoke scotch accent repeatedly called name summoning look see 
others rose looked could see nothing night dark rain fell 
dawn came however search rewarded set upon pinnacle abbey church staring straight window lordship sleeping room yards distant dreadful head andrew woods furiously abbot asked done horrible thing monks sure bewitched cows shrugged shoulders suggested grave andrew opened see lost head 
done length although reasons abbot forbade talking violation dead 
well grave opened maldon away one mysterious journeys lo andrew beam oakwood stuffed straw shape man sewn blanket 
real andrew rather left lay may remembered another grave supposed filled sir christopher harflete 
day forward whole countryside fifty miles round rang tales known blossholme witchings proof still seen men withered head andrew perched upon pinnacle whence none could found remove love money 
noted abbot changed sleeping chamber except sickness struck monks thought drinking sour beer bedevilments abated 
indeed time men things think since air thick rumors impending change 
king threatened church church prepared resist king 
talk suppression monasteries fact already suppressed talk rising faithful shires york lincoln high matters called abbot maldon much away home 
one day returned weary satisfied long journey amongst news awaited found message prioress pondered ate food 
also letter spain studied eagerly 
nine months passed since ship great yarmouth sailed time heard never reached seville like every one else abbot believed foundered deep seas 
sad event borne resignation seeing although meant loss letters importance aboard several persons wished see especially sir christopher harflete sir john foterell serving man jeffrey stokes said carry certain inconvenient documents 
even secretary chaplain brother martin could spared maldon felt character better suited heaven earth best men must prepared sometimes compromise conscience 
short vanishing great yarmouth wise decree far seeing providence removed certain stumbling blocks feet late forced travel rough thorny road 
dead tell tales although true ghost sir john foterell grinning head drunken andrew pinnacle seemed instances contrary 
christopher harflete jeffrey stokes bottom bay biscay could bring awkward charges left none deal save imprisoned forgotten girl unborn child 
things changed however spanish letter hand told great yarmouth sunk since two members crew escaped said declared captured turkish infidel pirates taken away straits gibraltar place unknown 
therefore survived voyage christopher harflete might still living might jeffrey stokes brother martin 
yet likely probably would perished fight hot headed englishmen three best committed turkish galleys whence one man thousand ever returned 
whole little cause fear dead good dead especially midst many pressing dangers 
fear stood rather church rich inheritance girl nunnery unborn child yes emlyn stower

knew well thomas bolle thing seemed absurd 
yet could denied said thomas emlyn instigation worked much evil monks blossholme paying rather abbot back coin 
yet done tell facts would condemn thomas fearful fate even would called upon share although possibly might cleared charge witchcraft 
emlyn set matter cicely urging neither one side waited judgment

cicely said nothing use seeing soon would learn ate food knowing would need strength 
cicely nursed child placing emlyn arms knelt pray 
still praying door opened procession appeared 
first came two monks six armed men abbot guard prioress three nuns 
sight beautiful young woman kneeling prayers guards rough men though stopped unwilling disturb one monks cried brutally seize accursed hypocrite come drag time stretching hand though grasp arm 
cicely rose faced saying touch follow 
emlyn give child let us go 
went midst armed men monks preceding nuns bowed heads following 
presently entered large hall threshold ordered pause way made 
cicely never forgot sight appeared day 
lofty arched roof rich chestnut wood set hundreds years hands spared neither work timber amongst beams bright light morning played clearly could see spiders webs one sleepy autumn wasp caught fast 
mob people gathered watch public trial faces many known childhood 
stared stood head steps sleeping child held arms packed audience prepared condemn could see hear point frown set cry witch told died away 
sight daughter one great men widow another standing innocent beauty slumbering babe upon breast seemed quell till hardest faces grew pitiful full resentment 
three judges bench behind table sat monkish secretaries hard faced hook nosed old bishop gorgeous robes mitre crozier resting panelling behind peering beady eyes 
sullen heavy jawed prior distant county left clad simple black gown girdle waist 
right clement maldon abbot blossholme enemy house suave olive faced foreign looking black uneasy eyes observing keen ears catching every word murmur whispered something bishop caused smile grimly 
lastly placed already roped space guarded soldier poor old bridget half witted gabbling words one paid heed 
path clear ordered walk 
half way hall something red attracted cicely attention glancing round saw beard thomas bolle 
eyes met full fear 
instant understood dreaded lest betrayed given awful doom 
fear nothing whispered passed heard perhaps emlyn glance told safe 
least sign relief broke 
entered roped space stood 
name asked one secretaries pointing cicely feather quill 
know cicely harflete answered gently whereon clerk said roughly lied old wrangle began validity marriage abbot maintaining still cicely foterell mother base born child 
argument bishop entered zest asking many questions seeming less take side since matters religion concerned keen lawyer enough 
length however swept thing away remarking brutally half heard true soon name last called life would concern bade clerks write cicely harflete foterell 
emlyn gave name sister bridget written without question 
next charge read 
long technical mixed latin words phrases cicely made accused many horrible crimes called devil consorted shape monster horns hoofs father ghost 
finished commanded answer pleaded guilty rather cicely emlyn bridget broke long tale could followed 
ordered silent one took heed said 
bishop asked whether women put question told said seemed pity evidently stubborn witches discipline sort might saved trouble 
asked witch marks found spot devil sealed bodies well known chosen could feel pain 
even suggested trial adjourned pricked nail find spot ultimately gave point save time 
last question raised beetle browed prior submitted infant ought also accused since said consorted devil according story rescued death afterwards carried arms given nun bridget evidence said bridget 
guilty infant innocent ought burn together since babe nursed evil one obviously damned legal minded bishop found argument interesting ultimately decided safer overrule account tender age criminal 
added matter since doubtless foul fiend would claim ere long 
lastly witnesses called emlyn asked advocate defend bishop replied chuckle quite unnecessary since already best advocates satan 
true lord said cicely looking best advocates mis named 
god innocent advocate trust 
blaspheme sorceress shouted old man evidence commenced 
follow detail necessary indeed would long took many hours

judges returned evidence went

judges went put first cicely afterwards emlyn series questions nature abominable denying first indignantly stood silent refusing answer proof positive guilt black browed prior remarked triumph 
lastly hideous queries exhausted cicely asked anything say
