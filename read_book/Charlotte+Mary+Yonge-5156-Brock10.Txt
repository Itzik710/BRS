besides colonel influence children lady merrifield alethea 
piteous change darkening life crushing grief death young people found entirely different stratum society 
ready work could help feeling mortification relegated mysterious line gentry found rockquay viewed level clerks shop girls place 
still time went miss companionship intercourse used 
mr flight person higher rank took notice perceived usual patron friend perhaps essentially enough gentleman free airs condescension even alexis might wise making much approach beautiful girl kalliope 
besides fit eagerness something like promises apparently let alexis drop using musical services anything promote studies young man thirsted proposing anything younger boys would soon outgrow national school 
alexis made semi friends among musical youth place one sympathise studious tastes much appearance manners cause accusation stuck music really point contact fellows lower professional class 
kalliope less time principle cultivated kindly terms young women employed 
severe style beauty removed jealousy rival admired almost worshipped glory workshop 
felt superiority owned ability nobody capable companion 
thus sister brother almost wholly depended upon one another like breath seemed golden age lives gillian merrifield walked office treating kalliope freedom equal affection old friend 
much time spare gillian looked exercises noted corrected errors explained difficulties mistakes translation testament delectus feeling time much mastery subject pupil mr pollock home ever attained
