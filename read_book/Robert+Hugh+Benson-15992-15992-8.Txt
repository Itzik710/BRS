latter kind thought robin best suited life riding day north country storms lodging hardily best could living desperate enterprise priest life prices upon heads spies everywhere

little visions came went imagination 
robin riding like knight adventure christ work robin altar vestments robin absolving penitents rosy light faith romance 
saw even scaffold undaunted resolute god light face crowd awed beneath saw soul entering heaven harps ringing meet eternity begun times heaviness came clouds upon derbyshire hills understood nothing lost another loveless empty life lay womanhood without fruition 
latter mood fell swift entire looking window little dinner time saw suddenly hat cecily head jerking steep path led house

next squire taken course action plainly disconcerted lad though conveniences 
instead increasing old man fury news son given contrary effect 
seemed shaken said robin spoken quietly holding anger surely must boy thought without difficulty 
upshot said robin leaving matstead present one word even fines 
seemed almost old man trying far could push son recoiled learned effect pushing 
think frightened said lad gravely 
never thought could priest 
mrs manners considered silence 
may autumn dr allen letter comes back asked presently 
robin said

struck attention manner seemed little changed 
graver accustomed 
shall forget said softly

alice began soothe gently tell husband great danger yet well known loyalty best answer girl pitiful questions 
marjorie sat back considered 
marjorie remarkable knowledge methods government gathered almost endless stories heard traveling priests others business know 
two three things therefore girl account correct plain 
first concerted plan mere chance arrest 
mr audrey message showed much circumstances topcliffe arrival confirmed 
next must simple blow struck one man mr thomas fitzherbert topcliffe would come london unless larger quarry mr thomas aimed 
thirdly conclusion would easy therefore get mr thomas released 
remained number questions yet means answering 
mr thomas heir enormous fitzherbert estates county elsewhere struck beginning merely general assault derbyshire taken place born mr thomas apparent coolness towards faith evident heard mass long refusal entertain priests present lack zeal part would course known army informers scattered throughout england marked bird flown would indeed blow catholic gentry county fitzherberts fall stood presently grave thoughts 
mistress alice glanced 
going little said marjorie

bowed passed lawyer confidential clerk servant mr george beaton passage big man communications popish affairs 
mr john biddell like marjorie father partner one quiet folks live storms without attracting attention elements yet without sacrifice principle 
catholic never pretended anything else little harmless man ever troubled 
pleaded magistrates unobtrusively deftly would appeared grace lord hell timid respectful air iron rimmed spectacles speckless dark suit little black cap drawn ears 
communicated marjorie last two three years subject wandering priests calling gentlemen greatest care allowing indiscreet word ever appear letters remembered king harry seen visit london assisted legal authorities considerably restoration queen mary soundlessly acquiesced changes elizabeth far least mere law concerned 
mr william bassett different man

considerable estates langley blore places cheerfully evaded new laws maintaining helping priests directions man fact ardent boisterous faith extended report ran even magic astrology man means spite frequent fines recusancy aged fifty years old time high color face bright merry eyes 
marjorie spoken twice 
two men first turned round chairs stood salute marjorie came upstairs parlor 
somewhat dark room panelled space books two windows looking square

cries laments much 
stopped paying compliments 
seemed woman fearless resolute face would well without 
set relate tale 
seemed little mrs thomas given true enough report 
true topcliffe arrived london morning arrest mistress manners perfectly right opinion signified good deal 
seemed mr bassett council made great mistake striking fitzherberts 
quarry strong said birds government used strong many 
first fitzherbert ever yet yielded allegiance either church queen grace likely mr thomas would begin next one yielded suadente diabolo deus avertat dozen would spring 
position serious said mr bassett mr biddell nodded assent would deal estates make suitable arrangements heir already largely controlled laid heels largeness undertaking recognized council plain enough less man topcliffe mr bassett spat floor named topcliffe devil possessed worse devils sent take charge matter 
marjorie listened carefully 
fear sir asked presently man sat back chair 
mr bassett smiled broadly showing strong white teeth iron gray hair fringed lips 
fear said 
score men quartered town 
trial trial shall praise god trial falls year 
harry magistrates doubt squeeze private 
trial word treason doubt 
treason surely 
seek fasten upon us 
would sound well christian shed christian blood christianity grace sorrowfully arraign subjects loves cossets much treason sound cause law books smiled manner almost snarl eyes grew narrow ironic merriment

wished know could aught mr thomas wife great deal wife said 
keep quiet comfort 
needs poor soul told comfort shall thomas month god forgive lie marjorie stood men rose 
said went swiftly window noise crying cheeses murmur voices ceased sudden 
straight opposite window stood tiled flight stairs ran market place first floor guildhall great building business town largely done magistrates sat need lane clear booths carts left leading door straight across square could see two little brobonets iron guns guarded door either side 
lane looked advanced little procession sight seemed stricken square silence 
already crowd dividing end end ranging either side farmers men shambled way turned see women clambered carts holding children see across square came country folk running might see 
steps cross already crowded sightseers 
yet outward sight little procession ordinary enough 
first came three four town guard livery carrying staves half dozen sturdy fellows couple dignified gentlemen one knew mr roger columbell magistrate town walking alone figure man tall thin little rustily cleanly dressed dark suit carried head stooping forward looking ground something deprecated much notice 
marjorie saw clearly 
notice group men followed case protection needed agent council crowd swirled behind 
solitary figure came beneath windows recognized man seen tower london 
god smite man growled voice ear 
topcliffe going prison daresay 
marjorie turned pale face back saw face kindly mr bassett suffused convulsed fury 
chapter ix marjorie marjorie wake order hath come 
night 
slowly marjorie rose glimmering depths sleep fallen hot august afternoon sunk upon arm great chair stood parlor window saw mrs thomas radiant waving scrap paper hand 
nearly two months passed yet opportunity given prisoner wife visit time impossible go back hills leave girl alone 
heat summer stifling valley huge plague grasshoppers ravaged england times even grass country outside derby chirping become intolerable 
heat necessary seclusion anxiety told cruelly upon country girl marjorie face perceptibly thinned eyes shadows beneath yet knew must go since young wife attached altogether finding alice said dull spirits 
mr bassett gone 
word trial although hearing two magistrates known topcliffe continually visited prison 
one piece news comfort time mr john prediction fulfilled regard captured priest mr garlick back rheims months deported england since first offence would soon doubt next time death stake game 
marjorie drew long breath passed hands forehead 
order said 
order girl explained torrentially 
man come guildhall asked mrs fitzherbert gone hall see rest useless details 
effect leave given last visit prisoner two persons mrs fitzherbert must one must present order gaoler seven clock would admitted 
looked constitution mind happy order release 
marjorie drove away last shreds sleep kissed 
good news said 
begin something 
sun sunk far set last throw whole square golden shade narrow overhung friar gate windows upper stories near man might shake hands friend side twilight already begun 
determined walk order less attract attention spite filth knew must pass along couple hundred yards separated prison 
every housewife emptied slops doors swept house place heaps would pushed together removed part lay bones rags rotten fruit dusty one spot blew dampened others pail two poured forth 
heat stifling cast towards evening roofs walls drunk day burning skies 
stood door last waited beating great iron knocker iron plate kind despair came marjorie 
advanced far two months allowed speak prisoner talkings mr biddell understood little 
indeed hinted plainly enough even might pawns enemy hand show mercy often allowed prisoner friends free access order shake resolution 
cause congratulation lay solely thought means far failed 
one thing least knew comfort talk torture full couple minutes door opened show thin brown faced man sleeves rolled dressed shirt hose kind leathern apron 
nodded saw ladies air respect however stood aside let come 
civility asked order read holding light came little barred window door 
unspeakably dreary little entrance passage stood wainscoted solidly floor ceiling wood looked damp black age ceiling indistinguishable twilight floor seemed composed packed earth three four doors showed woodwork opposite one entered stood slightly ajar smoky light shone beyond 
air heavy hot damp smelled mildew 
man gave order back read made little gesture resembled bow led way straight forward 
found passed half open door another passage running right angles entrance windows heavily barred exclude faintest twilight even though sun yet set appeared foliage kind pressing outside little central yard lay light alone could see way along uneven earth floor came flambeau hung door evidently put man opened led passage left couple steps unlocked another door enormous weight thickness closed behind 
found complete darkness 
moment mistress said voice heard steps go dark cease 
marjorie stood passive could feel girl hands clasp arm could hear breath come like sobs 
could speak light shone somewhere roof almost immediately man came back carrying another flambeau 
called civilly followed 
marjorie trod soft damp thing crackled beneath foot 
groped round one corner waited heard key turning lock 
man stood aside went past room 
figure standing first moment could see 
great shadows fled way gaoler hung flambeau 
door closed behind elizabeth flung husband arms 
ii marjorie could see last put wife single chair stood cell gave stool sitting upon table shocked change face 
true wavering light flambeau see single barred window pale glimmer wall yet even shadowy illumination could account paleness fallen face 
dressed miserably clothes disordered rusty looking features looked pinched elongated 
blinked little time time lips twitched beneath ill cut moustache beard little spasms passed talked across whole face 
pitiful see yet pitiful hear talk assumed kind courtesy mixed bitterness 
fell silent glancing swift furtive movement eyes one visitors back 
attempted apologise miserableness surroundings received saying grace hostess could everywhere guests must best could 
mixed sudden wails wife sudden graspings hands 
seemed quiet girl sat ill ease little three legged stool way meet adversity 
drove criticism told ought rather admire one christ confessors 
bring hope mistress manners said presently told talk yet formal trial hope may meet accusers face face thought perhaps lifted eyes swiftly dropped 
shook head 
yet ask meet accusers 
prove nothing except indeed recusancy known long time back 
prove nothing harbouring priests within last year rate done 
seemed stopped passed shaking hand mouth eyeing two women momentary glances looking

began talk presently derbyshire hills padley norbury 
asked wife news home gave interrupting laments 
yet eyes strayed marjorie something would ask could 
seemed completely unnerved first time life girl began understand something gaol life must signify 
heard death painful question perceived something heroism needed meet yet never imagined life confinement might watched man known world curt almost masterful gentleman careful dress particular deference due become worn prisoner careless appearance stroked mouth continually twice gnawing nails paced abominable hole tumbled heap straw blankets represented bed rickety table chair stool sole furniture

mr thomas snorted impatiently 
yes gone back cried leaves rot thinks bear ever seems mr bassett done utmost sir said marjorie 
exposed daily

marjorie explained 
nothing world done order came trial rather everything done already 
lawyers rely exactly defense spoken shown prisoner harboured priests witnesses already spoken men norbury padley would swear certain knowledge priest received mr fitzherbert least previous year eighteen months 
therefore kind reason mr bassett mr john fitzherbert remain longer derby 
mr john gone advice lawyers constant communication mr biddell papers ready names witnesses made one application already trial come 
neither father uncle bassett come see snapped man 
tried sir said marjorie 
permission refused

accursed interrupted biting sharply lip 
instant girl thought old distrust justified contemplated way making terms would disgraceful catholic 
terms could fitzherbert evading blood victim chosen council answer rest 
nothing except denial faith formal deliberate apostasy could serve think nephew old sir thomas son john inconceivable 
seemed way torment prison must borne 
wished could borne manfully 
seemed watched train thought fastened upon 
wife begun lamentations bewailing cell clothes loss liberty asking whether ill whether food enough eat hardly answered glanced except remembered tell good gift gaoler would mean little better food perhaps light 
resumed pacing three four times turned girl caught eyes fixed one instant

misty morning white cheerless early fog drifted river 
last night news come anthony least one taken near harrow disguise streets full riotous rejoicing capture 
thought prudent wait till receiving news much dreaded lest haste bring suspicion message carried since disappear would meant almost inevitable association party plotters hard time pass 
early morning anthony flight awakened hear rapping upon inn door peeping window seen couple plainly dressed men waiting admittance seen 
deliberately refrained speaking landlord except remark upon luggage caught sight piled longer entrance little room man used 
landlord said shortly yet sent 
greater part day told companions come rheims letter seemed show party made friends disappeared probably suspicion made necessary arrangements departure young mr arnold spent walking abroad usual 
days followed bitter heavy 
liked neither stop within doors go abroad since one course might arouse inquiry second lead identification 
gone lord vaux house friend without learned details anthony capture though dared even attempt get speech unless rest men caught would easy prove anything 
one thing therefore prayed heart rest might yet escape 
told party something course events much 
sunday intervened went hear mass fetter lane numbers catholics resorted piece piece learned plot even anthony told
