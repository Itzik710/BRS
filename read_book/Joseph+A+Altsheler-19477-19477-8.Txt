sons forest fear rain hurried clothing noticed rapidly storm gathering 
heat great days earth parched thirsty 
men talked evening rain said welcome would boys shared general feeling 
drought would ended

strong lads inured many hardships border forest fear ill results mere wetting 
nevertheless wished comfortable influence warm wind soon found dry 
intensely sleepy could scarcely keep eyes open wilderness training came use 
hilly country many outcroppings stone cavelike openings sides steep low hills place boys sought 
long hunt grew tired sleepy every step 
hungry might sleep could forget 
heard hooting owls wind moaning among leaves made strange noises 
crash thicket beside jumped momentary alarm startled deer far scared running bushes henry ashamed nervous impulse 
found last resting place sheltered ledge dry stone hollow hill 
stone arched dark recess boys tired worry shadows 
crept hollow scraping fallen leaves soften hard stone lay 
slumberland less five minutes

world bright beautiful conscious acute pain center 
increasingly hungry 
paul showed equal surprise prey annoying sensation important region 
looked sun found almost directly overhead indicating noon 
country strange unbroken expanse hill forest nowhere sign human 
scrutinized horizon keen eyes boyhood saw line smoke rising chimneys wareville 
whether villages lay north south east west know wind sighed gently forest never told 
alone wilderness knew moreover wilderness vast small 
henry paul despair fact thought entered henry mind 
instead began find certain joy situation appealed courage 
resolved find something eat used first temporary cure pangs hunger 
strong clasp knife cut strips soft inner bark slippery elm tree chewed drawing little strength sustenance 
found hour two later nearly ripe wild plums ate small quantities later ripe blackberries juicy sweet 
paul wanted voracious henry restrained knowing well indulged liberally might suffer worse pangs hunger 
slender diet boys felt much strengthened spirits rose wonderful manner 
bound found sooner later said henry strange live woods 
guns ammunition said paul could get meat wanted live well home

hook baited triumphant flourish henry swung toward stream 
said biggest fish ever swam creek 
boys might caught nothing rude outfit doubtless stream never fished inhabitants besides full natural curiosity dream danger coming outer air 
therefore bit curious looking metallic thing tempting food upon suddenly dropped somewhere 
first fish slipped henry feared nothing try 
sixth seventh bite succeeded landing fine perch upon bank paul uttered cry triumph henry became superior dignity moment took victory modestly 
reality something rejoice two boys perhaps dangerous situation knowledge border understood 
wilderness full animal life fleeter man without weapons helpless

light fire henry expected easiest tasks proved one difficult 
struck forth elusive sparks went setting fire wood

tied strong cord made strips clothing one end stout bush bent curved semicircle 
end cord drawn sliding loop around pegs attached little wooden trigger set center inclosure 
slightest pressure upon trigger would upset cause noose slip pegs close jerk around neck anything might head thrust inclosure 
bush would fly back place would intruder really hanged 
common form snare devised small game boys early kentucky still used

cheerful bonfire happy thought boys build even aside uses signal coming night wilderness always lonesome weird 
lay near soft turf henry watched red sun sink behind black forest west 
strange sympathetic feeling wilderness came mind 
thought mysterious regions lay beyond line black red met 
could live woods living without arms even rifle ammunition could live luxury 
wonderful freedom old thought came renewed force 
roam pleased stop pleased sleep pleased would make canoe float great rivers mouths 
would wander far vast plains say lay beyond thousand miles forest see buffalo millions go thundering

panthers sprang headlong undergrowth eagerness get away terrible flaming vision darting upon 
flight quick disappeared instant henry knew would venture near site fire long time 
turned back found paul surprised alarmed standing erect rubbing eyes

paul know much henry concerning panthers affair got nerves 
lonely vast grandeur wilderness attraction comrade wished strong log walls comfortable roofs wareville 
henry reassured

savage army seemed melted away air full five minutes lay waiting waiting always waiting something knew would come 
rose fierce quavering war cry poured hundreds throats savage horde springing forests thickets rushed upon 
dark faces showed sunlight brown figures naked save breechcloth horribly painted muscles tense flashed undergrowth 
wild yell rose fell without ceasing ran distant echoes among hills 
riflemen kentucky lying behind trees hillocks began fire volleys order man according judgment aim many bullet flew true 
sharp crackling sound ominous deadly ran back forth forest 
little spurts fire burned moment green went give place others

schoolmaster resting one elbow firing across log 
indian tactics charge home unless enemy frightened flight war whoop first rush 
men wareville marlowe run stood fast sending bullets straight mark suddenly shawnees dropped among trees undergrowth bodies hidden began creep forward firing like sharpshooters 
test skill eyesight hearing aim 
forest either side filled creeping forms white red men burning eyes seeking slay meeting strife terrible foes encounter open conflict 
something snakelike deadly creeping moving grass tell passed sometimes white red died locked fast grip one another

one comrades muttered worth dozen men day 
fierce combatants eager blood notice sky gray morning blue opening battle grown leaden somber 
leaves motionless began rustle dully raw wet wind north 
sun quite gone behind clouds drops cold rain began fall falling upturned faces dead red white alike impartiality wind rose whistled drove cold drops like hail 
combat still swayed back forth leaden forest neither side took notice 
mr ware remained near center white line retained command although gave orders every man fighting giving orders 
time time ross sol henry brought news conflict perhaps driven back little one point perhaps gained little another point 
man fifty head community shared emotions around filled furious zeal conflict 
clouds thickened darkened cold drops driven upon wind rifle smoke held rain made sodden banks vapor among trees clouds vapor burst flashes fire occasional triumphant shout death cry white man savage 
henry ware looked became conscious clouds bringing darkness day waning 
west faint tint red yellow barely discernible grayness marked sinking sun east blackness night still advancing 
yet conflict important engaged great battle civilized foes hundred thousand side far fierce yet hung even chance 
white men still stood stood forest battle began red men able advance would retreat 
henry heart sank little signs night coming would harder darkness keep forces touch superior numbers shawnees would swarm 
seemed would best withdraw little open ground waited wish movements color retreat 
moreover activity shawnees rose higher pitch 
figures invisible chill wet dusk fifty sixty yards away two lines came closer 
keenest eye could see nothing save flitting forms like phantoms riflemen trained quickness fired sent fatal bullet 
two lines fire facing dark wood 
flashes showed red yellow twilight falling rain indian yell triumph whenever arose echoed weird terrible dripping forest 
henry stole side father 
must fall back said darkness night sure surround us crush us 
ross able second advice reluctantly mr ware passed along word retreat 
sure bring wounded order 
dead alas must abandoned nameless indignities little white army left thirty dead dripping forest many carried wounds curable full fight ever 
merely drew back protect flanked forest faces borderers sullen determined still turned enemy 
yet line fire visibly retreating shawnee forces saw triumphant yell poured hundreds throats 
rushed forward driven back hail bullets ross said mr ware guess burned faces 
look wounded look wounded repeated mr ware 
see man weak left help 
gone half mile henry glanced around paul 
eyes trained darkness ran dim forms 
many limping others already arms slings made hunting shirts henry nowhere saw figure old comrade 
fever fear assailed 
one two things happened 
paul either killed badly wounded walk somehow darkness missed 
schoolmaster face blanched news 
paul favorite pupil 
god groaned think poor lad hands devils henry ware stood beside master uttered words wrenched despair bottom chest 
pain shot heart touched knife 
paul well beloved comrade youth captured subjected torture blood turned ice veins 
could ever missed boy paul seemed henry least ten years younger 
merely fault single man fault

nothing sure death found lose henry touched father hand 
act tenderness coming stoical nature next instant gone amid smoke vapors darkness toward indian army 
mr ware put face hands groaned hand ross fell upon shoulder 
boy come back mr ware said guide bring 
god given woods cunnin none us match 
mr ware let hands fall became man 
retreating force still fell back slowly firing steadily flashes pursuing foe 
henry ware gone fifty yards completely hidden friends 
turned savage least appearance 
threw raccoon skin cap hunting shirt drew hair scalp lock tying piece fringe discarded hunting shirt turned angle woods 
presently beheld dark figures shawnees springing tree tree bent low undergrowth following eagerly 
saw bent fired toward comrades whirled right sprang seeking another target 
appearances darkness driving rain true shawnee manner gesture indian second nature 
little fear discovered time 
sole thought find comrade 
old days boyish companionship rushed upon memories 
tenderness nature stronger long repression 
would find alive would save moreover thought clew 
remembered seeing paul crouched behind log firing enemy one seen afterwards 
believed boy lying yet slain fate kinder badly wounded move 
line retreat slanted somewhat spot savages might well passed dark without noticing boy fallen body 
sense direction perfect edged swiftly away toward fallen log behind paul lain 
many dark forms passed none sought stop counterfeit good thought one 
presently henry passed flitting warriors 
battle moving toward south behind 
looked back saw flashes growing fainter heard scattering rifle shots deadened somewhat distance 
around beat rain leaves sodden earth looked sky wholly hidden black clouds 
would need forest lore primitive instincts handed far ancestors 
never keenly alive night 
boy veer way merely sense direction took straight path toward fallen log remembered 
din battle still rolled slowly toward south moment forgot 
came log bent touched cold face 
paul 
instinctively hand moved toward boy head touched thick brown hair nothing else uttered little shuddering sigh relief 
dead alive hideous indian trophy taken 
found boy wrist pulse still beating faintly 
deft hands moved touched wound made bullet passed entirely shoulder 
paul fainted loss blood without coming help would surely dead another hour 
boy lay side convulsion lost consciousness drawn arm head 
henry turned cold reviving rain fell full upon face raising listened intently 
battle still moving southward slowly stray warriors might yet pass see 
tie friendship strong come save paul found mean stopped 
stooped chafed wounded youth wrists temples rain vivifying touch still drove upon face 
paul stirred pulse grew stronger 
opened eyes catching one vague glimpse anxious face feeble lids closed 
henry cheered 
paul alive growing stronger bending lifted powerful arms 
strode away darkness intending pass curve around hostile army 
despite paul weight able also keep rifle ready none knew better chances favored meeting one warrior curve made 
instinct strength mental physical true type borderer men faced sturdy heart vast dangers wilderness known unknown 
moment highest pitch courage skill alone darkness storm surrounded danger death worse yet ready risk everything sake boy played 
heard nothing patter distant firing around gloom night dark intensity 
rain poured steadily sky contain single star 
paul stirred occasionally shoulder advanced swiftly picking way forest undergrowth 
half mile forward ears caught light footstep 
instant sank burden caught sight indian warrior twenty feet away 
shawnee saw time dropped undergrowth 
henry feel lust blood 
would willing pass leave shawnee knew shawnee would leave 
laid paul upon back order rain might beat upon face crouched beside absolutely motionless missing nothing keenest eye ear might detect 
contest patience white youth brought bear upon red man training 
half hour passed within small area sound beat rain leaves sticky earth 
perhaps warrior thought deceived merely illusion night thought saw seen anyone man gone creeping away undergrowth 
stirred among bushes raised little see gave enemy passing glimpse face 
enough rifle bullet struck eyes wilderness fighter lay dead forest 
henry bestowed thought slain warrior lifting paul continued wide curve nothing happened 
one interrupted parallel line fire 
passed around came rocky ground laid paul chafed hands face 
wounded boy opened eyes returning strength able keep open 
henry said vague whisper 
yes paul henry replied quietly 
paul lay still struggled memory
