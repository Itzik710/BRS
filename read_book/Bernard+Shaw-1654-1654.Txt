days later gossip subject subsiding fresh scandal revived 
literary friend mr jansenius helped compose epitaph added couple pretty touching stanzas setting forth henrietta character one rare sweetness virtue friends would never cease sorrow loss 
tradesman described monumental mason furnished book tomb designs mr jansenius selected highly ornamental one proposed defray half cost erection 
trefusis objected epitaph untrue said see tombstones privileged publish false statements 
reported followed former misconduct calling father law liar ordered common tombstone cheap jack east end 
fact spoken contemptuously monumental tradesman exploiter labor asked young working mason member international association design monument gratification jansenius 
mason much pains misgiving produced original design 
trefusis approved resolved executed hands designer 
hired sculptor studio purchased blocks marble dimensions quality described mason invited set work forthwith 
trefusis encountered difficulty 
wished pay mason value work less 
could ascertain 
available standard market price rejected fixed competition among capitalists could secure profit obtaining workmen products paid could tempt customers offering share unpaid part products reduction price 
thus found system withholding indispensable materials production subsistence laborers except condition supporting idle class whilst accepting lower standard comfort idle class rendered determination ratios exchange consequently practice honest dealing impossible 
last ask mason would consider fair payment execution design though knew man could solve problem though would certainly ask much thought could get demand must limited poverty competition monumental tradesman 
trefusis settled matter giving double asked imposing conditions necessary compel mason execute work make profit hiring men market rate wages 
design author astonishment paid separately 
mason hesitating long time two pounds ten five pounds emboldened fellow workman treated hot whiskey water name larger sum 
trefusis paid money set find much similar design would cost hands eminent royal academician 
happening know gentleman position consulted informed probable cost would five hundred one thousand pounds 
trefusis expressed opinion mason charge reasonable somewhat indignation artist friend reminded years royal academician spend acquiring skill 
trefusis mentioned apprenticeship mason quite long twice laborious half pleasant 
artist began find trefusis socialistic views previously fancied sympathy odious dangerous 
demanded whether nothing allowed genius 
trefusis warmly replied genius cost possessor nothing inheritance whole race incidentally vested single individual individual employed monopoly extort money others deserved nothing better hanging 
artist lost temper suggested trefusis could feel prerogative art divine perhaps could understand painter fool design tomb five pounds might painting portrait thousand 
trefusis retorted fact man paying thousand pounds portrait proved earned money therefore either thief beggar 
common workman sacrificed sixpence week wages cheap photograph present sweetheart shilling pair chromolithographic pictures delft figures place mantelboard suffered greater privation sake possessing work art great landlord shareholder paid thousand pounds rich miss portrait like hogarth jack sheppard interesting students criminal physiognomy 
lively quarrel ensued trefusis denouncing folly artists fancying priestly caste obviously parasites favored slaves moneyed classes friend temporarily enemy sneering bitterly levellers levelling instead levelling

contrary happened

hush comes 
gertrude subsided 
could quarrel lady brandon without leaving house could leave house without returning home 
privately resolved discourage attentions erskine suspecting instead love pretended merely recommended jane marry 
chichester erskine made sketches palestine sir charles tramped many european picture galleries

lady brandon reddened anger 
sir charles noted guest reception secret satisfaction shared embarrassment oppressed present except trefusis seemed quite indifferent assured unconsciously produced impression others equal occasion indeed 
looking etchings came said sir charles hastening break silence 
care things handed proof 
trefusis looked never seen thing quite know make 
scratches seem meaning said dubiously 
sir charles stole contemptuous smile significant glance erskine 
seized already instinctive antipathy trefusis said emphatically one scratches meaning

put etching away showing disposition look portfolio remarked art interests photography 
erskine sir charles exchanged glances former said photography art sense understand term 
process 
much less troublesome perfect process said trefusis pointing etching 
artists sticking old barbarous difficult imperfect processes etching portrait painting merely keep value monopoly required skill 
left new complexly organized perfect yet simple beautiful method photography hands tradesmen sneering publicly resorting aid surreptitiously 
result tradesmen becoming better artists naturally photography drawing counts nothing thought judgment count everything whereas etching daubing processes great manual skill needed produce anything eye endure execution counts thought fellow fit carry bricks ladder like ambition perseverance enough train hand push van afford put back proper place thoroughly trained hands scarce
