therewith rose encounter way meet 
fool stands lets life move past like panorama 
also fool would lay hands motion change pictures 
distort injure ruin come upon awful shadows behind 
lo glanced around already something old mysterious loveliness long vanished face visible world returned yet dawning promise new creation fresh beauty welcoming turning old receiving new god sent 
might yet many time sad lament would act wronged would best weak foolish would look new life face please god make 
scents wind brought field garden moor seemed sweeter ever wind borne scents seeking comfort sighed turned sigh god found fresh gladness welcome 
wind hovered would fain something matter river rippled shone knew something worth knowing yet unrevealed 
delight creation verily secrets secrets truths way 
secrets embryo revelations 
far horizon heaven earth met old friends though never parted ever renewing friendship 
world like angels rejoicing sinner repented yet man passed lower higher condition life earth air going live look inferior world ere shades evening fell day around donal grant new childhood new world 
mean thoughts never present think thing look glass know god would us know must know live see see love friend eyes love friend sees 
make things real us end battle cause life 
often think believe presenting imaginations 
least thing overthrow kind faith 
imagination endless help towards faith faith dream food make us strong next day work 
know god beginning end root cause giver enabler love joy perfect good present one existence things degrees conditions life faith simplest truest mightiest form 
donal making way towards eastern coast certain hope finding work one kind another 
could well content pass life shepherd like father two things knew would well others know hunger society books 
man must able without whatever denied heart hungry honest thing may use honest endeavor obtain 
donal desired useful live generation also books 
good library would suit better buying books without place keep among impedimenta life 
donal knew regard books danger loving fashion world books strong inclination accumulate hoard therefore use library better means buying 
books possessions also things pass perish surely form earthly playthings god lets men may learn distinguish apparent real possession teach loss may 
would thought meeting youth walked road shoeless feet sought harbor great library old house day day feast thoughts men gone antiquarian soul soul hungry life mummy cloths enwrapping dead

spiritual foot pad 
walking southward would soon mountains well behind turn toward east 
carried small wallet filled chiefly oatcake hard skim milk cheese two clock sat stone proceeded make meal 
brook hills ran near chosen spot fare dry 
seldom took drink water learned strong drink best discounted high rate 
drew pocket small thick volume brought companion journey read ate 
seat last slope grassy hill many huge stones rose grass 
yards beneath country road side road small stream brook ran swiftly past almost within reach hand eagerly lost 
bank stream perfuming air grew many bushes meadow sweet queen meadow called scotland beyond lay lovely stretch nearly level pasture 
farther eastward plain full farms 
behind rose hill shutting past lay plain open eyes feet 
god walled past disclosing future 
eaten dinner dryness forgotten condiment book supplied rose taking cap head filled stream drank heartily emptied shook last drops put upon head 
ho ho young man cried voice 
donal looked saw man garb clergyman regarding road wiping face sleeve 
mind continued scatter favors 
beg pardon sir said donal taking cap hadna notion leevin cratur near 
fine day said minister 
sir answered donal 
way going asked minister adding apology seeming curiosity scholar see glance towards book left open stone 
nae sae muckle wad fain sir answered donal called mind resolve made speak english future 
modest youth see returned clergyman donal hardly liked tone said 
depends mean scholar said 
oh answered minister thinking much reply bantering humor willing draw lad learned man modestly calls scholar 
modesty saying much scholar like every scholar would say 
good answer said clergyman patronizingly learned man day smiled said 
would call man learned asked donal 
hard determine seeing claim contradict 
good wanting learned get mental discipline study 
seems said donal pity get body discipline may worthless 
good discipline teeth dine bread cheese would exercise sheep grass 
got hold humorist said clergyman 
donal picked wallet book came road 
first clergyman saw barefooted 
childhood often gone without shoes stockings yet youth lack prejudiced 
must fellow fault said 
catch chaff donal would rather forded river gone inquire way nearest farm house thought polite walk little way clergyman 
far going asked minister length 
far replied donal 
mean pass night barn perhaps hill side 
sorry hear better 
think sir decent bed costs barn generally hill side always clean 
fact hill side best 
many time slept one 
strange notion people respectable sleep man roof god settled abode said clergyman paused 
like abraham suggested donal smile 
abiding city seems hardly necessary pilgrims strangers fell asleep top glashgar woke sun looking edge horizon 
rose gazed moment created 
god called hardly astonished 
frightened asked minister 
sir man fear presence savior said god answered minister 
god savior presence desire come 
shelter atonement supplemented minister 
gien ye mean sir cried donal forgetting english onything come atween god ha e nane hae naething hide frae wha made wadna hide thoucht frae 
waur mair need see book reading asked minister sharply 
bible bound never got notions angry presumptuous youth wonder gospel minister preached gospel slavish unfilial 
shelley answered donal recovering 
minister never read word shelley decided opinion 
gave loud rude whistle 
go theology puzzled understand plain young man brink perdition 
book poison vitals indeed sir never go deep enough came near touching sat eating bread cheese 
infidel said minister fiercely 
kind one returned donal worst sort 
people call believers drive like poor shelley mouth pit 
hated truth said minister 
always seeking said donal though sure get end search 
listen sir say whether far christian 
donal opened little volume sought passage 
minister curiosity dread seeming absurd would stopped ears refused listen 
man merely dry stale deadly doctrines 
would man love christ protecting god leading god alone bliss darkness misery 
glimmer truth eternal life know god 
imagined justice love dwelling eternal opposition bosom eternal unity 
knew next nothing god misrepresented hideously 
god showed would worst possible misfortune created 
donal found passage 
mask anarchy 
read following stanzas let vast assembly great solemnity declare measured words ye god made ye free 
strong simple words keen wound sharpened swords wide targes let shade cover ye 
tyrants dare let ride among slash stab maim hew like let 
folded arms steady eyes little fear less surprise look upon slay till rage died away 
slaughter nation shall steam like inspiration eloquent oracular volcano heard afar 
ending reader turned listener 
listener understood little meaning less spirit 
hated opposition powers part yet scorned idea submitting persecution 
think sir asked donal 
sheer nonsense answered minister 
would scotland resistance one way resisting though returned donal 
enduring evil lord way 
know scotland fancy would christians better stamp world mode resistance always adopted called 
anyhow way 
shelley mean mean shelley mean christ spirit shelley far nearer truth made despise name christianity without knowing really 
god give every man fair play 
young man said minister assumption great solemnity less authority bound warn state rebellion god mocked 
good morning donal sat roadside would let minister good start took shabby little volume held talk book embodied spirit shelley saw clearly misled every notion christianity different gave notions must evangelists apostles 
saw poet boyish nature striving liberty scarce notion liberty really knew nothing law liberty oneness existence would us free freedom 
clergyman long sight rose went soon came bridge crossed river 
went cultivated plain spirits never flagging 
pilgrim way divine fate chapter iii

gloomy building apparently uninhabited drew attention sent strange thrill eyes fell upon 
three low stories windows defended iron stanchions door studded great knobs iron 
little way beyond caught sight sign search 
swung front old fashioned dingy building much old world look pervaded town 
last red rays sun upon lighting sorely faded coat arms 
supporters two red horses hind legs could make 
crest suggested skate could hardly intended one 
greedy eyed man stood doorway hands trouser pockets

black hair black eyes nose looked heavy finger settled upon point pressed downwards nostrils swelled wide beyond base underneath big mouth good set teeth strong upturning chin ambitious greedy face

earl 
met one way gate wood 
ascended hill dark ascending firs crown silvery birches often slowly circling road brought side saw rise like helmet gray mass fortress 
turret tower pinnacle battlement appeared disappeared climbed 
last stood almost top open space beheld nearly whole front could tell like 
grand pile looked gloomy one live 
stood broad grassy platform rose gravelled terrace terrace castle 
ran eye along front seeking door saw none 
ascending terrace broad flight steps approached deep recess front two portions house differing date nearly met 
inside recess found rather small door flush wall thickly studded plated iron surmounted morven horses carved gray stone surrounded several mouldings 
looking means announcing presence saw handle end rod iron pulled heard nothing sound bell smothered wilderness stone walls 
however appeared old servant bowed slow plentiful hair white wool mingled look childishness caution wrinkled countenance

immediately donal found larger less irregular stone case adorned heads horns skins animals 
crossing man opened door covered red cloth looked strange midst cold hard stone donal entered octagonal space doors dark shining oak carved stone lintels doorposts walls adorned arms armor almost domed ceiling

black silk neckerchief tied carelessly throat waistcoat pineapple shawl stuff completed dress 
one long little finger shone stone donal took emerald 
motioned visitor seat went writing rudeness like successful contractor nobleman 
gave donal advantage becoming little accustomed surroundings 
room large wainscoted good many things walls donal noted two three riding whips fishing rod several pairs spurs sword golden hilt strange looking dagger like flame fire one two old engravings seemed plan estate 
one window small stone mullion summer sun streaming 
earl sat flood heart seemed cold bloodless

donal glance eyes returned book sat silent motionless though seeing word

good one said donal 
wonder ground must beginning believe said miss graeme

seen nothing answered donal heard something 
one night first indeed heard sound far musical instrument faint sweet 
brother sister exchanged looks 
donal went 
got felt way winding stair sleep top baliol tower bottom lost sit wait light 
heard seemed nearer 
never heard since never mentioned thing 
presume however speaking harm 
least raise fresh rumors injure respectability castle think instrument sound might proceeded lady arctura musician told surely likely piano dead waste middle night impossible say far sound may travel stillness night sound waves cross break 
well hector said sister know mr grant neither first second heard sound one thing pretty clear said brother nothing revellers cards sound reported different attributed sure suggested donal violin shut even none could play time enough learn 
sound heard might ghostly violin 
though like stringed instrument different anything ever heard except perhaps certain equally inexplicable sounds occasionally heard among hills 
went talking thing pacing garden sun hot heads grass cool feet 
enough said miss graeme rather forced laugh make one glad castle go title 
asked donal 
answered anything happen boys hector would come title 
sister mind said mr graeme laughing genuinely 
title nothing keep simple misfortune 
certainly take patent 
wise man would lay claim title without means make respected 
come exclaimed donal 
must even old titles country buttressed respectability money away quiet places reading old history books peasants accustomed think differently 
millionaire money lender buy old keep arundel castle would respect much present earl would said mr graeme 
confess better 
fallacy argument added thinkingly 
believe 
title worth nothing without money money must title lazarus donal went inheritor title would use lesson dives stairs 
scorn think honor wait heels wealth 
may think always shall poor man know therefore 
time title trifle given reason using homage mammon said nothing 
part said miss graeme quarrel riches except come way 
know use abuse donal made reply turn look divinely stupid surprise pity upon young woman 
use say anything argument absolutely triumphant mammon would sit marked great indifference lord convincing understanding men knew thing would understand relations reasons truth belongs human soul soul able see know truth takes therein first possible almost last necessary step towards understanding 
miss graeme caught look must perceived expression face flushed rosy red conversation grew crumbly 
half holiday stayed tea went arm buildings mr graeme revealing practical knowledge going entertainer soon saw opinion must worth something whether fancies

turned table began write many emendations afterwards result old garden 
stood ancient garden high red walls around gray green lichens shadowy arabesque wound 
topmost climbing blossoms fields kine haunted looked within shelter shadow daintiest odours 
alleys lurking arbors deep glooms dive lawns soft fleeces daisies counted five 
sun dial aged gathered thoughtful grace round shadow seemed furrowed face 
flowers oldest ever garden sprung red blood red dark purple rose lamps flaming hung 
along borders fring broad thick edges box stood fox gloves gorgeous poppies great eyed hollyhocks 
junipers trimmed castles ash trees bowed tents garden though ancient pensive still wore quaint ornaments 
stately fantastic old wind hardly would stir young spring merrily entered must feel place ii 
stood summer morning cavernous yew sun gently climbing scents rose dew 
saw wise old mansion like cow noonday heat stand pool shadows rippled feet 
windows oriel latticed lowly wide fair chimneys like clustered pillars stood thin blue air 
white doves like thoughts lady haunted train green blue comets peacock went marching 
birds trees singing song old world love green leaves sunshine winter folded furled 
sang never sadness melted passed away sang never darkness came conquering day 
knew maiden somewhere sober sunlit gloom nimbus shining garments aureole white browed bloom looked garden dreamy knew old looked past gray sombre saw green gold

browned brooded twilight sank calm till seemed human sorrows could balm

growing darkness growing growing till eyes appear like spots deeper twilight transparent clear thin hot air trembling thin sun molten crape deepening shadow something taketh certain shape shape whose hands uplifted throw back blinding hair shape whose bosom heaving draws air

everything changed 
longer either sheep company 
alone walking swiftly beyond park fierce wind north east battling ruling like fiery horse

felt first feet one feels without hearing tones organ building small allow scope vibration waves made ground beat soles feet walked soon heard like infinitely prolonged roaring sky built organ 
drawing sea whether body body knew conscious forms existence whether forms relation things outside whether belonged world within unaware 
roaring great water organ grew louder louder 
knew every step way shore across fields fences stiles 
turned way avoid ditch deep sandy patch 
still music grew louder louder length came face driving spray flying touch wings tones went hurrying past depths awful distance feet wading bent tufted sand hard bare wave beaten sand front 
dark could see white fierceness hurrying waves rushed shore leaning toppling curling self undermined hurled forth sound falling roar defeat 
every wave complex chord winnowed tones feathering round 
paced sand seemed ages 
paced know always turned went back instead going 
suddenly thought saw something dark hollow wave swept fall 
moon came broke something rolled surf shore 
donal stood watching 
move next wave would reclaim ocean looked like body man matter many tossed hollows music something came back ancient years ages gone men could word used said men ought body might dead dead one might like rushed water caught ere next wave broke though hours cogitation ratiocination recollection seemed intervened 
breaking wave drenched head foot clung prize dragged 
moment bewilderment came lying sand arms round great lump net lost fishing boat 
illusions gone 
sitting cold wind wet skin border wild sea 
poor shivering altogether ordinary uncomfortable mortal sat shore german ocean rescued tangled mass net seaweed dragged beyond reach waves set home 
time reached castle quite warm 
door foot tower open crept soon fast asleep

god expects perform duties got rid throwing thing aside giving another 
family god real giver property question put might arise hardly take interest enough capable discussing 
understand duty sheep cattle master father mother brother sister pupil davie owe ancestors love honor keeping name unspotted though duty forestalled higher property leave behind power trust never think see obligation regard comprised duties property 
family merely gone come best thing come receive property duties performed light righteousness radiating 
call duties property property consist land begin 
land value would possession involve duties suppose
