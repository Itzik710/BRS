fortunately details extraordinary expedition cortez fully related contemporary writers several eyewitnesses scenes described 
necessary however revert prescott admirable work conquest mexico given summary drawn vivid picture events campaign 
book far surpasses interest volume fiction strongly recommend readers take first opportunity occurs perusing whole story able touch upon principal events

chapter startling proposal 
march rd trading vessel swan dropped anchor plymouth 
would days considered tiny craft indeed looked upon large vessel one owner master diggory beggs good reason proud 
eighty tons burden ships sailed plymouth much larger size plymouth even rising importance seaport flourished mightily since downfall successful rival fowey 
large ships needed days cargoes sent across sea costly precious goods occupied small space 
cloths flemings silks satins italy produce east passed first hands venetian genoese merchants wines france spain chief articles commerce 
thus freight vessel eighty tons heavy venture none merchants wealth position would think employing larger ships 
respect spaniards italian republics far ahead us commerce england small thing indeed comparison flanders 
plymouth however swan regarded goodly ship master diggory beggs heartily congratulated acquaintances news came swan sailing sound safely returned voyage genoa 
soon anchor dropped sails furled captain reuben hawkshaw cousin master beggs took place boat accompanied son roger lad sixteen rowed two sailors landing place 
delayed minutes number reuben acquaintances thronged round shake hand soon freed strode narrow street quays house master diggory 
reuben hawkshaw tall powerfully built man weatherbeaten tanned many comings goings upon sea voice could heard loudest storm fierce look men knew gentle kind heart though daring seemed fear danger either man tempest 
roger large boned loosely jointed likely day fill big man father stood six feet two without shoes 
reuben wont complain big shipboard 
crew men wholly size would say ship would able carry scant crew lie close would would room full complement 
indeed days space precious board ship men packed well nigh close could lie small thought comfort well content room turn without angering lying next either side 
merchant stout portly offered strong contrast cousin rose desk latter entered 
glad indeed see back cousin reuben trust fared well 
indifferent well cousin diggory 
good stock italian goods board course took small portion hold put cadiz way back 
filled three score barrels spanish wine warrant return good profit price paid 
met accidents adventures reuben useful 
fight moorish pirates coveted goods doubtless guessed laden beat stoutly loss six men killed among us 
bad weather coming portugal coast two men washed overboard another stabbed drunken brawl street 
besides course many wounded fight moors drunken frays ashore well loss little blood harm voyage may termed easy pleasant one 
well merchant said tone satisfaction 
expect voyage like pass without accident 
roger asked turning boy standing near door cap hand please elders address 
well thank master diggory 
seldom anything ails 
trust mistress mercy cousins well 
best go upstairs see roger 
father weighty matters talk would fain alone 
roger glad escape merchant counting house bowing cousin went quiet step closed door behind changed rapid bound ascended stairs 
gently roger mistress beggs said entered room two daughters sitting work 
truly glad see must remember stay home people accustomed boisterous ways sea 
reproof administered kindly tone roger colored hair indeed delight back forgotten manners expected lad age shore 
however knew although mistress beggs somewhat precise ways thoroughly kind always treated nephew rather young cousin husband therefore recovered momentary confusion stepped forward receive salute mistress beggs always gave return voyages 
dorothy agnes remember cousin roger two girls remained seated work however made little progress since father run two hours say swan signaled sound rose made formal courtesy held cheek kissed according custom day little smile amusement faces would told close observer mother present greeting would warmer less ceremonious one 
well well roger mistress beggs went marvelous see fast grow scarce six months since sailed away seem half head taller went swan returned safely without damage peril damage speak cousin mercy save shot holes hull good many patches side work moorish corsair sharp brush way 
loss life roger come back nine hands shorter sailed board still unfit hard work 
fight cousin roger dorothy beggs asked 
could bow got alongside joined melee well could 
heathen fought bravely match men wanting weight strength little able stand crushing blows axes 
nimble quick curved swords fierceness faces shouting would put men countenance less reason confident 
trading gone well asked mistress beggs known keen eye main chance 
believe father well satisfied cousin mercy venture turned fully well looked 
well roger 
girls go work 
sew listening 
go see preparations dinner going regularly maids apt give way talk gossip know swan 
soon left room two girls threw work running across roger saluted heartily 
much better welcome roger said formal greetings gave 
wonder cousin mercy would said chanced come 
mother guessed well enough would alone together dorothy said laughing 
always thinks right special occasions keep us manners make us sure know becoming behave know well roger strict us generally likes us enjoy 
staying farm aunt peggy lets us run never interferes us save spirits carry us away altogether 
think glad always lived country 
roger let us hear much voyage fight moors 
black men dorothy 
much darker fishermen bronzed sun wind 
black men live somewhere near country several fighting 
blacks bigger men moors thick lips wide mouths 
believe live slaves among moors fought bravely needed man stout heart engage ugly faces 
terrified roger frightened first dorothy felt strange weakness knees began swarm ship side passed scuffle began 
see time think 
best even frightened ever badly hope showed would brought shame upon father well truth thought little one way 
deck driven back set work like englishmen honest men thanks pikes axes much trouble especially became fairly angered seeing friends undone heathen 
would rather go two three fights encounter another storm coast portugal four days 
seemed must lost waves exceeding bigness far surpassing anything ever seen 
heart mouth scores times thought would never rise great weight water poured 
truly mercy god alone saved us believe even father thought ship would beaten pieces though kept show confidence order inspirit men 
however end fourth day gale abated days great sea went waves coming long regular hills seemed big devonshire smooth regular rolled mightily naught fear 
like sailor agnes said 
would far better roger come father counting house 
know would take business cousin reuben desire 
roger laughed 
make poor penman agnes 
love sea dearly seldom gales meet worse drowned come death 
well content cousin matters would stay ashore spend life writing rich greatest merchant plymouth 
almost wish sometimes born spaniard portugal might chance sailing wondrous new countries instead voyaging european waters 
seems plenty see roger dorothy said 
say nay roger assented see spain portugal claim indies east west keep others going 
pope given indies dorothy said 
see pope give roger replied 
might king minister wolsey bishops time people read master wycliffe bible come see warrant authority pope claims may perhaps take share new discoveries 
hush roger speak loud bible 
know though many read thing spoken openly would bring us sore trouble anyone hear us speak freely done 
burning lollards say wolsey determined root followers wycliffe 
take trouble roger said shrugging shoulders 
still careful dorothy would account bring trouble upon 
thank heaven england spain men forever tortured burned religion 
english would never put 
may persecution methinks rather whose opinions lead make speeches regarded seditious stir people discontent fall trouble long folks hold opinions peace quiet trouble others neither king cardinal seek interfere 
spain 
upon slightest suspicion man woman holds views differing priests dragged away thrown prisons inquisition tortured burned 
mistress mercy returned girls busied laying table dinner 
evening mistress mercy girls roger retired bed reuben hawkshaw cousin long talk together concerning next voyage swan 
master diggory discussed chances voyage low countries another trip mediterranean reuben silently listening said well cousin diggory tell truth turning project seems offer chance greater profit though deem without risk 
case course trading affairs know greater risk greater profit question considered whether profit fair proportion risk run 
think case ready risk life carrying 
consider whether ready risk venture 
reuben voyages know unless indeed think sailing constantinople trading grand turk 
thoughts go farther afield still diggory 
matter thought time cadiz day made many inquiries confirmed opinions matter 
know spaniards gaining huge wealth indies heard cadiz conquest made year since island call cuba stores precious things brought home vast indeed 
know bring gold spices precious woods articles native workmanship kinds 
know reuben also like dogs manger suffer none others sail seas english ship ever yet traversed waters 
diggory hear number islands large reports lies farther west great land procure chiefly gold silver precious things 
seems matter secretly conducted news could sent spain ship might slip cruise dealing natives return richly stored treasures 
swan fast sailer fall spanish ships would show clean pair heels 
course would avoid places spaniards forts garrisons touch hear trade little took scroll bosom unrolled showed map 
purchased ten gold pieces spanish captain come poverty disgrace ship cast away asleep liquor cabin fault rare among spaniards therefore thought 
met cadiz wine shop near port 
told story drank together spoke dutch traded much low countries 
took map show places adventures 
said thing curious would buy disposed sell 
said would much life worth part englishman indeed captains ships trading seas allowed seeing matters connected islands held state secret 
trouble chaffering however agreed make exact copy sell ten gold pieces 
copy 
exact compared original paid 
see laid position bearing islands together ports places spaniards settlements 
line represents mainland see vaguely drawn seeing except one two points spaniards little knowledge 
seems help might navigate swan avoid much risk falling dons might yet make shift fill ship goods kinds would sell great prices 
know course taken killed without mercy first place would catch us would easy second capture us methinks would difficult still seeing crew stout devonshire lads fighting halters round necks would give good account even overhauled great spanish galleon 
think scheme cousin diggory perilous one certainly reuben merchant replied long silence 
risk loss ship freight risk loss life crew would rather lose even swan reuben harm come roger 
may well even carried scheme successful end returned laden wealth king counselors matter came ears would sure return would make prodigious talk might grievously offended accuse us embroiling england spain confiscate cargo visit fine imprisonment treat crew pirates 
fear reuben said 
relations spain grown cold lately talk peace us france 
next place say king would mightily glad see chance us english finger pie spaniards want keep perceive great advantage arise obtaining share trade indies 
rare jealousy country spaniards portugals keeping trade indies hands methinks even judged necessary make show displeasure men led way matter would end much honor well profit venture 
grave matter reuben one undertaken without much thought calculation 
still proposal tempting one possession map examine leisure would help much enterprise 
truly say although king might frown would much honor well profit first english merchant dispatch ship spanish main 
love spaniards like englishmen think matters religion viewed much disfavor alliance men cruel persecutors religion 
hate reuben hawkshaw said energetically 
swagger lords world hold others account beside 
resolve enterprise shall course utmost avoid try lay hand us shall right glad show englishmen hold fully match 
well well must think diggory beggs said hastily nevertheless cousin swan sails seas see well provided ordnance small arms shall able hold would meddle 
ask diggory 
meddle meddle us treat us pirates slain without form trial must blame us act pirates come upon us 
hold beyond law beyond sight land going westward take word 
piracy things whispered cruelty natives true pirates innocent kindly folk compared 
openly proclaim found seas claim treated enemies slain without mercy shall therefore fully justified treating enemy spanish ship may come across holding fair prize strong enough take 
must go intent reuben 
fit swan go indies may trade honestly natives ready trade may wage war spaniards 
quite understand cousin diggory reuben hawkshaw said grim smile also intent spaniards let adhere attacked must defend 
try capture us beat natural capture 
nothing say reuben 
find authority scripture spaniards claiming portion seas right 
world seems open trade neither pope anyone else right parcel exclusive use one two nations 
know seas within mile two shore held belong naturally land different thing altogether holding half seas inasmuch know held private property spaniards portugals 
well say present 
plenty time think swan unloading 
certainly like take great risk would shoulders could get two three others join willing enough embark upon 
need tell diggory behooves right careful may broach 
remember incautious word might ruin enterprise altogether 
much whisper reached ear spanish ambassador london would apply king put stop whatever king harry might think could hardly permit swan sail face remonstrance would assuredly embroil spain 
careful reuben see well shall speak men worked joint adventures whose discretion surely rely 
talk matter reuben first appear favorably disposed shall meet show map explain intentions fully 
three others join equal shares shall propose idea obtained map shall equal share us business shall addition pay master take one fifth profits payment expenses 
content right well cousin diggory moment shall tell regard rich man 
unloading swan occupied time 
undue haste days 
bales hoisted whips hold carried master beggs warehouse 
sailors earned fair time repose hardships voyage took matters easily week swan hold empty 
time merchant made allusion reuben conversation evening swan came port 
reuben neither surprised anxious silence 
knew cousin although enterprising cautious man hardly hoped find proposal favorably entertained 
looked absolute refusal first expected would arrive end long disputes discussion 
therefore doubted diggory turning matter mind settling details perhaps broaching matter merchants spoken 
swan empty laid shore dried low tide could seams caulked coat pitch laid waterline made tight sound voyage might dispatched reuben hawkshaw lost wife years port plymouth always occupied lodgings house short distance cousin spending evenings mostly master diggory refusing take breakfast dinner 
know cousin would say merchant pressed roger come breakfast dinner 
women women right hold nicety things nothing displeases people come late meals 
work work clock strikes hour meals middle job see finished men knock 
matter washing cleaning one gathers much dust dirt hold ship would roger could never reckon upon punctual matter would weigh mind ought thinking things 
diggory free men taking bite sup board make shift get work coming clean hands clear mind supper 
swan hold empty time enough talk amusement 
evening unlading cargo completed master diggory said wife get table cleared soon mercy bring two flasks last batch spanish wine cellar put cups board 
two three friends coming talk matter business reuben 
soon table cleared roger asked permission aunt take cousins walk upon hoe 
readily granted room could well bestowed set wine upon table dame mercy retired look domestic matters always found abundance occupy 
short time master turnbull master streatham master winslow three worshipful traders plymouth arrived 
cousin reuben master diggory said spoken good friends mine respect venture proposed would fain hear lips 
speak confidence whether agree cast lot us word matter pass lips 
reuben addressed task much greater detail given first speaking matter diggory 
told gathered sea captains others articles dons traded natives 
part cheap common amount required sufficient stock merchandise would small 
small hand mirrors strings colored glass beads brass rings trinkets colored handkerchiefs bright cloths articles chiefly used barter 
knives axes greatly prized natives considering iron valuable silver gold 
small bells brass vessels also valued iron spear arrow heads eagerly sought spaniards chary providing goods seeing might used conflicts 
produced list stores would required ship crew 
matter said think perhaps demands excessive opinion money way would well spent 
rule though say men accustomed victualing ships crews vilely provided 
salt meat must eat obtained sea good quality likewise provisions 
want biscuits alive maggots moldy flour peas things cattle would turn noses 
want everything best kind cider good sound fair abundance 
ordinary voyage 
shall away many months maybe year two unless men well fed assuredly lose health likely enough become mutinous 
come upon spanish ship three parts crew weak scurvy shall make poor fight 
therefore want keep men good strength good heart must well fed 
voyage english ship ever made cooped shall swan must carry great crew everything depends upon fair ground grumbling 
many ship lost crew weakened scurvy bring enterprise good end say must stint matter provisions must best kind 
trust shall able obtain abundance fruit vegetables natives things necessary keep men blood sweet shipboard 
arms 
think carry twelve pieces six side four good size yet large quickly handled 
matter weight spaniards sure advantage us shoot much quickly equalize matters 
course bows arrows 
hold greatly new musketoons man shoot six arrows fire one straighter truer aim though true carry somewhat farther 
course pikes boarding axes good stock powder balls cannon 
complete lists made 
hold carry eighty hundred men 
pay ordinary rate wage interest venture according rank 
profits would leave masters reckon seeing fair trade one get gold say nothing silver weight weight iron things proportion judge amount say nothing chance falling spanish treasure ship may rash enough regarding us easy prize fall foul us 
doubt profits great return safely home master hawkshaw nicholas turnbull said chances seem small 
think chances good enough risk life upon master turnbull reuben replied man show greater confidence 
map cousin diggory doubt spoken 
see islands many great places spaniards ports comparison 
avoid anywhere else open trade natives 
chased find place hot us make away mainland cruising along may come upon places spaniards never visited may gather great store gold silver without danger 
wish one certainly cousin diggory enter upon affair unless confidence good heart 
would far rather take horse travel bristol lay scheme traders 
idea distasteful traders plymouth regarded bristol great jealousy diggory beggs said reuben 
friend master nicholas turnbull mean regarded scheme hopeless risks doubtless great 
know earn great profit one must run risk venture divided four us would heavy one say beyond justified periling 
would leave us reuben examine lists made reckon total cost shall see better much shall contribute make venture 
reuben nodded putting hat left room saying hour return strolled tavern much frequented masters ships port

misfortune happens one able point streets say fed men worse dogs thought profits nothing lives served 
indeed master diggory short time quite forgot provision health comfort crew outcome reuben hawkshaw insistence came regard feeling pride man possessed greater benevolence fellow merchants 
week refitting swan completed afloat large proportion stores hold 
ship london came round took berth alongside discharging large numbers bales cases together six cannon addition carried large store ammunition 
naturally gave rise fresh talk town 
say fitting swan pirate master beggs one merchants said twelve cannon peaceful trader positively require 
yes meet none peaceful people neighbor meets peaceful needs much defense ship war 
master hawkshaw much ado beat moorish pirates attacked last voyage present one longer dangerous put stress upon add much armament 
valuable cargo return voyage strongly urged upon provide means defense may ensure able beat meddle besides far read course politics seems alliance spain well nigh end swan return may war 
good reason give master means defending stoutly

small comparison great cities valley holy shrine numbers come cities round pay devotion days festival 
forty temples town fire burns night day largest holiest 
passing several streets roger saw great hill rising front 
whether work man natural hill foundation knew 
four sided pyramidal form 
terraces rising one supported stone walls 
steps angles led one terrace another placed anyone mounting pass right along terrace round pyramid arrived steps leading 
top pyramid seemed cut leaving area far could judge fifty feet square 
smoke ascended summit malinche told fire always burns altar center 
reaching foot pyramid governor pointed building considerable size 
see said leading roger towards great gateway well god honored 
neared gateway roger saw building well nigh filled immense pile carefully built first appeared cannon balls larger size seen piled batteries plymouth white color 
thought struck great turnips root might held sacred god 
entered building truth flashed across great pile composed entirely human skulls 
roger made mind although would give way slightest matter faith would yet abstain shocking religious feeling natives 
first involuntary start discovery silenced feelings asked many skulls heap 
could however understand reply yet mastered aztec method enumeration complicated one 
roger walked along one side pile counted number skulls line number rows tried reckon many skulls 
roger quick figures although father tried hard teach calculate rapidly necessary one traded bought sold goods descriptions able keep figures would otherwise forced always carry supercargo indeed custom almost trading ships masters could read write far less keep accounts 
however found hundred skulls line ten rows heap nearly square difficult task arrive conclusion must hundred thousand skulls pile 
seemed beyond belief yet could arrive conclusion 
hundred thousand victims offered one temple comparatively small city must total men killed throughout country pile doubt long time growing perhaps hundred years even would give thousand victims yearly one temple 
although seemed well nigh impossible roger yet means excessive according accounts historians mexican spanish number victims slain annually altars mexico amounted twenty five fifty thousand 
god good reason pleased aztec ambassador watching roger face closely remarked 
fond blood sacrifices indeed pleased roger said quietly gods love slaughter 
quetzalcoatl god air loved men taught know god would abhor sacrifices blood 
offerings fruit flowers taught men grow arts instructed would vastly pleasing human victims 
roger spoke tone authority sure stated 
white god left shores human sacrifices offered gods fact roger learned malinche told custom introduced comparatively late years 
said ten generations supposed would mean two hundred years custom would abhorrent 
aztec governor looked grave 
god war sacrifices offered idea kindly white god stood next public estimation might object worshiped might object altogether human sacrifices offered unpleasant yet white stranger clearly spoke acquainted mind quetzalcoatl 
tezcucan envoys hand looked pleased 
tezcuco maintained long time milder form worship

next morning roger started tezcucan envoys journey 
informed way aztec governor previous evening dispatched officer high rank mexico give emperor full details conversation sayings strange visitor dispatches available sending news facts occurrences could used mediums conveying thought 
montezuma mild gentle disposition quite unlike two predecessors mighty warriors doubtless heart welcome words said yesterday concerning quetzalcoatl

dedication great temple huitzilopotchli thirty years ago seventy thousand captives put death 
must miserable creatures roger said indignantly submitted tamely fate 
might least rushed upon guards however numerous died fighting 
roger said little day journey 
admiration first felt arts civilization people succeeded feeling abhorrence 
heard malinche victims sacrificed gods afterwards cooked eaten although scarcely believed girl spite solemn assurances could seeing vast pile human skulls quite believe true 
chapter tezcuco

true told captives reserved purpose slain night might sacrificed next small consolation 
seemed joyful cries greeting could hear screams agony victims pitch wrought seen could recognized priests would fallen upon sword

thus aztec religion strange mixture good evil

chapter massacre cholula 
tlascalans moment admitted beaten spaniards laid aside hostility indeed accepted alliance enthusiasm 
right proud valor resisted attempts great aztec monarchy conquer defeated slaughter greatly superior forces mere handful white men able withstand attacks day day defeat best hardiest troops led generals hitherto always successful excited surprise admiration highest degree 
gods knew killed conflict men seemed infinitely superior strength courage heard proud enter alliance heroes 
moreover saw would opportunity turning tables upon enemies plains 
believe moment montezuma would admit white men capital case would great battles perhaps much plunder gained therefore spaniards ready advance whole fighting force tlascala placed disposal 
cortez however declined take large army 
appearance force composed bitter foes aztecs would combined whole strength empire would destroyed hope might remain peaceful arrangements 
moreover difficulty feeding large body men would great indeed authority would feeble constant broils aztecs would inevitable result 
therefore many thanks declined offer said would gladly take force six thousand volunteers 
first march cholula whose people sent warm invitation cortez visit montezuma last envoys also requested journey forward way city 
tlascalans strongly urged refuse invitation 
cholulans said treacherous people trusted 
bigoted beyond people cities cholula holy city anahuac 
god quetzalcoatl remained twenty years way coast instructing people arts civilization 
great temple god pyramid whose base covered forty four acres whose height hundred eighty feet platform summit sacrifices took place acre size 
cortez however decided upon visiting cholula 
deemed reports tlascalans prejudiced long standing animosity two peoples thought avoid visiting important town lay almost road mexico might set aztecs distrust fear 
departure tlascala witnessed whole population state assembled bid white men farewell wish success upon way 
day march took within mile two cholula 
met many nobles city urged enter evening cortez bearing mind warnings received thinking dangerous enter streets unknown possibly hostile city dark declined move forward morning

roger line march taken place among troops cortez directed times near hand alone army personal knowledge country traverse could give information size towns nature roads advantages offered respectively supply provisions likely obtained facilities getting water etc 
cortez therefore father aquilar acting interpreter enjoined ramble city releasing guards exercises 
dressed like rest us said none dream understand language pass along express freely sentiments may entertain us 
expect love us doubtless though may flatter us faces curse us heartily behind backs 
care nothing curses ill long proceed plots conspiracies us

nevertheless guard 
men like mountain friends rough fighters hearty honest people

although roger heard occasional remarks showed opinion inhabitants montezuma allowed strangers enter country purpose destroying general feeling hostility satisfaction defeat inflicted upon tlascala far outweighing feeling 
wandering hours party returned quarters roger gave malinche cortez account noticed

two days arriving capital roger asked malinche could obtain permission general cross lake tezcuco order might pay friends visit 
presently returned saying general would speak 
roger named sancho spaniards ventured give name supposed forgotten borne child 
sancho general said know marina says great intelligence though long cut people 
see position strange one

desperate battle allies fled soldiers stood ground thanks aid blessed virgin resisted attacks made upon 
eight men slain juan mortally wounded 
indian prisoners taken said attack like cholula made orders montezuma 
may us good service finding intentions mexicans 
therefore means carry intention going across tezcuco 
young king nephew emperor suffered much montezuma hands stripped greater part father dominions 
therefore hardly friendly heart 
rate may able learn conversation sentiments towards us 
tezcuco long rival mexico alliance tlascalans proved greatest advantage us still benefit tezcucans friends 
retire mexico might take refuge 
rate nothing else comes might learn king whether aware treachery meditated us

quite right cuitcatl agreed 
priests furious altogether blame 
general may says come ambassador king montezuma orders come court costs blame fought way whenever opposed justify insulting religion even assaulting hurling gods every opportunity 
even tried persuade emperor gods false spoke insolently yesterday montezuma conducted request holy shrines

strange time since left 
part capital 
news came day day progress whites filled everyone surprise consternation 
council met daily montezuma passed time shrines among priests 
brave warrior great general longer 
father prophecy seems unmanned given wholly superstition 
believe gods pay due honor hold man think trust wholly priests men like methinks poor judges worldly affairs though wise learned matters concerning religion 
montezuma thinks otherwise result orders issued determination arrived disgrace seeing handful strangers installed capital 
mind counsels always conducted honorably coast treated ambassadors done neither one thing 
loaded gifts forbidden come 
yet since came spite orders seemed feared meet blush thought treacherous plan destroy cholula 
gods prophesied would find grave 
gods wrong may god whites powerful 
avenge indignities offered whites cempoalla images hurled altars cholula sacred temples attacked captured emblem white god set summit roger hawkshaw warned us spaniards 
said cruel masters people conquered things cruel matter religion forcing came sway accept god pain death would slay even white man like know belong people 
tell us done 
men capital objects brave strong hope overcome nation force anahuac forsake gods accept god whites 
know designs cortez leader call malinzin 
say spaniards several motives 
first place desire wealth spoil second religious ardor desire bring within pale church third place love adventure lastly honor receive hands sovereign opening rich empire arms 
think intend conquer us cortez think means disposal cacama doubtless sent home reports richness country forces many times numerous command may sent assistance 
know come hither cacama asked suddenly 
roger replied 
could leave palace without permission malinche told kindness experienced hands 
uneasy position finds uncertain montezuma intentions fearful assault bade try find far might general opinion respecting spaniards 
opinion ignorant cacama said contemptuous wave hand worth nothing 
go led 
believe last told 
shout told shout 
opinion upon aught relates 
among nobles priests learned much division opinion 
present wait frankly moment storm may follow calm 
priests course bitterly hostile strangers without doubt working great power 
say whole safer would across water 
mean immediate danger must remember montezuma insulted humiliated made appear small sight people 
one proudest men although present feigns friendship spaniards moment come revolt thus bearded capital wave hand invaders wiped 
however let us talk matters present 
course thinking returning tonight intended canoe came waiting 
think letting go cacama said decidedly 
send official back message saying think returning crave leave stay present come morning report learned 
leave soon daybreak see general back full heat day 
roger hurry return cuitcatl went dispatch official message cortez rather malinche message would delivered privately whereas cortez asked man might brought presence engaged officers 
roger know whether fact away palace made public cortez might consider would cause discontent among followers known last joined recruit permitted leave town whereas one else allowed stir beyond limits quarters 
chapter tezcuco 
late hour night roger sat talking cacama family 
although heard bathalda happened time leaving tezcuco arrival tlascala go 
bathalda told roger found former acquaintance malinche powerful white leaders amenche asked many questions concerning roger known long like applied instead going straight white general 
heard speak roger said answer first question 
told learned language mexican slave girl one attendants time tabasco 
whole time learning language conversing know got time 
sorry leave behind promised ever got rich enough would send purchase freedom 
seem taken strange interest slave girl amenche said 
natural princess 
little better slave 
rate prisoner naturally took one person kind 
companions friends rather master attendant directly heard cortez gained great influence naturally went 
beautiful used think beautiful tabasco together changed greatly months passed since saw 
yes think certainly beautiful 
beautiful others seen 
go girl persisted 
speak language spaniards necessary safety believe one rescued spanish ship cast gale shores little lad 
gone cortez direct would probably guessed dress speaking language came seen malinche saw would recognized would doubt told cortez known time cast ashore near tabasco somewhat two years ago 
would known could spaniard could short time lost language 
cacama interposed asked many questions tlascala people 
tlascalan princes caziques gave daughters wives spaniards six roger replied 
ladies first baptized christian religion married priests many chief leaders spaniards 
think cacama asked 
think much roger said business mine ladies friends 
certainly politic course part cortez tlascalans bound alliance closely together 
methinks upon work spaniards engaged man better without wife sake 
man goes battle one think may take joy strife knows falls makes great matter anyone 
wife hard left widow slain must ever present fighting though may fight less stoutly must cause grievous anxiety take away pleasure fighting 
already told us white men good husbands queen said 
know way better respect people queen maclutha 
good bad men treat wives well men neglect 
told us one wife said even kings kept rule well humblest subjects 
roger said 
one man one wife whatever rank 
occasion palaces king extensive montezuma 
officers married return home leave wives behind could marry roger said ladies become christians married according rites church could lawfully set aside 
wife england roger hawkshaw cacama asked 
roger laughed merrily 
boy left home far marriage goes boy still 
consider young enough take wife five twenty lack six years yet 
man cacama said gravely 
man size strength man courage well showed day attacked numbers best soldiers 
thoughtful prudent 
years go nothing 
man even years according customs young marry 
tell heard much bad business cholula tell think treachery part people mere pretext spaniards fall upon inhabitants sack town sure treachery intended roger said 
learned three people lady two priests cholula nobles taxed cortez intention fall upon us admitted accusation true 
besides whole people arms ready attack poured leaders assault moment first gun told intentions discovered 
doubt whatever general destruction white men intended although punishment inflicted terrible say justified circumstances 
moreover knew mexican army lying short distance away readiness enter town join attack us 
terrible error well crime part emperor true concerned cacama said 
took one counsel acted wholly advice priests 
general considers danger lies 
would trust caziques men rank whatever country faithful word pretend friendship mean hostility 
montezuma guided would fear treachery given priests means oracles persuade almost anything cortez feels danger great 
well better rest cacama said rising 
start first streak light back sun high long past midnight 
cuitcatl would think well accompany friend 
rumor may got abroad guest longed blood may long 
would cross lake unattended 
propose young noble said 
know priests guess present white victim desire 
therefore certainly accompany mexico 
roger mexican friend taken across lake canoe rowed four strong men 
one private canoes palace without royal insignia used conveyance messengers built speed 
took across capital short time entering one canals landed close palace occupied spaniards 
sentry gate surprised height young aztec chief approached recognize spoke 
even would let pass called officer 
absent order general roger said 
doubt right officer replied must take 
cortez risen hour still early sun showing mountains east 
taking cup chocolate 
right said officer soon saw roger 
sancho absent upon orders 
called malinche adjoining room 
back earlier expected said soon interpreter entered 
serious news general 
cacama friendly 
unaware treacherous designs part emperor admits situation critical one possible influence priests may induce montezuma take hostile action 
think could count upon ally think sir although yet sounded 
cacama badly treated montezuma means approves emperor conduct throughout matter think patriotism would overcome sense private wrong 
tell farther 
cacama invited stay present think might use 
think cortez said indeed yet entered band regularly like rest 
right freedom action especially man among us knows anything mexicans even marina knows nothing side mountains 
think run great risk staying alone marina asked account 
danger doubt malinche shall guard cacama take precautions safety 
even priests would venture seize palace tezcucans far less bigoted people city 
think much greater danger would cortez said remarks translated 
danger 
sitting mine may explode minute 
young fellow sharp witted knowledge language people trusted take care 
sancho anything happen us hear destroyed charge carry news coast order name shall embark board ship sail cuba 
would useless try maintain foothold 
spain would avenge ampler means mine carry conquest country 
minutes later roger said goodbye juan pedro told might absent time started tezcuco 
scarcely left town canoe six rowers issued one canals followed wake 
see us cuitcatl said looking back 
doubtless spanish quarters closely watched see enter leave news tall young noble entered carried authorities boat got readiness follow left see going 
however overhaul us 
bade officer charge canoes last night pick four best men light boat shall travel fast behind us although two extra hands 
yes four sitters roger said looking back 
doubt orders arrest bring back 
reckon speed 
two extra men destroy chances coming us altogether 
row hard men 
want boat overtake us 
paddlers redoubled exertions light boat almost flew along water 
minutes canoe behind also utmost plain falling behind rather gaining 
one officials stood shouted order stop 
distance behind words could plainly heard 
tezcucans looked scared heard words name emperor 
never mind cuitcatl said 
acting orders king 
besides far away sure words heard 
complaint make make cacama answer 
boat soon hearing pursuer fell farther farther behind good mile away landed tezcuco 
run boat lay side others cuitcatl said rowers 
go homes say naught anyone journey made 
officials find want know care nothing individual boatmen rowed us 
still well keep silent 
course roger lad asked drop second part name soon known returned 
numbers persons palace hidden besides well known sight people town 
quite see cuitcatl perceive good trying way conceal 
long legs mine got rid tell story plainly 
however makes difference 
shall safe palace shall go abroad daytime 
venture try carry openly one known cacama protection 
cacama return agreed roger use try conceal identity lad washing stains face hands took accustomed place banquet greeted many former acquaintances 
meal cacama told heard bathalda wonderful shooting made great bow desirous seeing orders forester sent evening cuitcatl directing artisans manufacture weapon similar strength 
go see getting said 
proceeding workshops attached palace found bow finished 
constructed tough elastic wood 
three slips placed together bound sinews 
bathalda ran forward saw roger taking hand carried forehead 
roger shook stout fellow hand heartily 
brave fellow said cuitcatl accompanied fought manfully well 
guarded back fight tell tale 
made bow according instructions head artisans said respectfully king seem us possible anyone use 
three us tried together string vain 
good bow roger said examining 
shoot weapons like cacama asked nodding direction mexico 
roger said part use crossbows bows much smaller 
english people use bows like 
national weapons outside island indeed even bend 
stringing knack rather strength 
see taking bow height placed knee bent slipped string notch ease 
holding arms length drew till string touched ear 
great deal stiffer made bathalda strength use home 
arrows 
made another set men inch two yard length copper tips 
examining cacama taken bow though strong vigorous man race could bend short distance 
wonderful weapon said thought mortal man whatever color could used 
let us go practice yard 
cuitcatl fetch queen ladies look 
great marksman prince roger said 
perhaps somewhat better average shot seen marksmen could feats would even attempt 
descended piece ground many young nobles engaged shooting practice arms 
roger often carefully abstained taking part mimic contests knew men beaten sometimes feel malice anxious keep best terms 
cuitcatl often urged try bout others sword always declined friend supposed aware skill means equal strength 
spaniards proved mexicans fighting powers white men roger longer reasons hanging back 
soon seen approaching cacama mexicans abandoned sport gathered round 
story defeat band montezuma soldiers white man whispered abroad cuitcatl mentioned friends heard bathalda mighty bow roger used saw weapon provided wonder large extent mingled incredulity 
passed hand hand tried vain bend murmured among thing impossible 
mark cacama asked 
one targets well enough said pointing mexicans shooting 
boards five feet six height fourteen inches width presenting size man 
painted white supported leg hinged behind 
distance mexicans shooting forty yards 
roger stepped hundred one made mark upon ground 
english archer would laugh target like said cacama nigh three years since practiced 
seen men could certainty distance hit bird size pigeon sitting top target twenty times succession think means extraordinary shooting 
queen ladies appeared upon terrace looking courtyard 
roger took bow fitted arrow string drew ear murmur astonishment rising aztecs 
pause moment arrow sped 
sharp tap struck target stood quivering center line four feet ground 
bow excellent one roger said quickly discharged two arrows struck within two three inches first 
power bow rather shooting roger wished exhibit target removed hundred yards farther back others placed one side 
distance discharged three arrows shooting carefully 
three struck boards although varying heights shout surprise arose lookers 
far carry cacama asked 
might carry another hundred yards aim depended upon two hundred yards even good shots roger said 
course longer ranges useful firing body men 
say large tree would extreme range 
send two men see whether shoot far 
see arrow 
tell stand one side tree well away saying arrow may go distance 
two attendants taken places twenty thirty yards tree roger drew bow fullest giving arrow elevation taught suitable extreme range unloosed string 
arrow dark wood glanced air 
eye could follow short distance 
sound heard time seconds mexicans seen running towards tree 
touch arrow cacama shouted followed crowd numbers greatly increased news going spread palace walked forward tree 
massive stem four feet diameter within inches center height three feet ground arrow sticking 
mexicans silent astonishment mingled certain amount awe shooting like seemed supernatural 
said good shot king said 
pure accident roger asserted

least idea 
wished show far well made bow would send arrow drawn englishman 
cacama ordered arrow left tree large stone placed spot roger fired 
shall remain said memento shot 
introduce among people custom say prevails country every child shall bound practice daily bows arrows 
think race ever come use weapon may least learn bend bows greatly stronger accustomed use 
doubtless roger said 
matter practice strengthening certain muscles right arm man far stronger would unable bend bow trained use earliest age 
recommend prince give order spoken institute monthly gathering prizes skill honors best marksmen 
way would take interest sport would become popular among youth us

three days later roger sitting cuitcatl attendant entered said king wished see immediately 
hastened royal apartment 
cacama walking angry frown upon face queen princess sitting couch pale agitated 
strange news come mexico cacama said 
white men seized montezuma holding prisoner quarters 
anyone ever hear outrage mexico state consternation present none know 
seems incredible roger exclaimed 
sure news quite certain prince replied 
news indeed true 
cortez found position unbearable 
believed attack upon spaniards coast well meditated treachery cholula outcome emperor orders 
native allies heard rumors town bridges across canals raised case spaniards would prisoners palace 
mexican capital yet effected nothing towards conquest country 
moment might hear landing expedition cuba authority revoked another reap benefit done 
therefore called council trusted officers discussed situation 
agreed step must taken 
favor starting night making way city sufficient force could collected oppose retreat others opinion better retire openly consent montezuma whose conduct since reached city appeared friendly 
cortez pointed methods would retreats whole country would probably rise 
moreover even reached coast would sacrificed valor sufferings 
proposed measure astonished even boldest companions namely go royal palace bring emperor persuasion possible force necessary quarters hold hostage safety 
proposal agreed following morning cortez asked interview emperor granted 
proceeded palace principal officers ordering soldiers follow groups twos threes attract particular attention 
montezuma began converse usual courtesy cortez roughly cut short charged author attack upon garrison port 
montezuma indignantly denied said would send arrest author attack 
cortez replied necessary safety montezuma come reside among 
emperor thunderstruck proposal soldiers crowded loud threatening words used montezuma fear life gave way 
possessed courage credited youth would called guards nobles around died fighting 
given assumed air done voluntarily ordered litter brought 
meantime attendants nobles present spread news city 
mexicans catching arms ran rescue monarch spaniards closed round litter blow struck emperor would doubtless murdered 
montezuma exhorted people tranquil assuring going willingly mexicans accustomed implicit obedience fearing harm would come emperor struggle began drew back allowed spaniards pass montezuma conveyed prisoner palace occupied spaniards 
act one almost unparalleled boldness performed upon monarch host assailants previously friendly relations act treachery reflects dishonor upon fame cortez 
time position occupied spaniards strange even desperate palliate though excuse course action 
reason believe montezuma intended act treacherously 
domination priests changed mind already several times done nothing could saved spaniards absolute destruction 
honorable man would acted cortez cortez rough soldier moreover firmly held doctrine time long afterwards held spaniards dealing religions faith need kept heretics heathen 
chapter treasure room 
tis infamous cacama said paced room done hold hands hostage heart capital among people capable hanging walls hostile movement made 
right roger hawkshaw warning us men 
without faith honor thus seize host loaded presents emptied treasuries appease greed treated extraordinary condescension 
crime unheard act base ingratitude without parallel 
done roger silent 
situation strange unlooked confounded 
say cuitcatl burst passionately every mexican take arms annihilate handful invaders 
though montezuma fall better monarch perish nation 
besides montezuma shown unfit govern 
weakness brought things pass 
think white men could ever advanced beyond plateau tlascala forces mexico barred way think could ever entered capital defended resolution one moment flattered strangers loaded gifts next ready send forces 
cholulans good reason believing designed annihilation whites actually order attack upon 
seacoast 
chiefs believed montezuma really friendly whites would ever attacked two courses open might first received spaniards frankly sent mission escort honorably capital might called upon every man dominion take arms drive sea 
took neither 
brought better thousand times die ruin fall upon country 
advice troops called messengers sent every city valley bidding send contingent march aid people mexico annihilate handful treacherous white men 
cacama silent 
advice accordance feelings temperament extreme reverence aztecs regarded emperor paralyzed 
shall see said gloomily 
short time shall know montezuma thus tamely suhmitted made prisoner 
may motives fathom 
believe coward 
aztec monarch yet ever shown want courage 
three four days later another event occurred heightened fury mexicans spaniards 
cazique attacked spaniards coast arrived mexico accompanied son fifteen chiefs acted 
montezuma referred matter examination cortez 
cazique admitted part taken attack spaniards seek shelter royal authority sentence death passed chiefs declared acted authority montezuma 
condemned burnt alive space front palace sentence carried 
content cortez placed irons upon montezuma saying could longer doubt guilt 
execution carried montezuma released fetters 
news insult monarch created profound impression upon mexicans 
although despised weakness sovereign appeared ready suffer every indignity yet claim appearance courtesy goodwill towards oppressors bolder spirits determined nation longer humiliated person sovereign even cost montezuma life effort made overthrow oppressors 
soon news execution seventeen nobles indignity montezuma received cacama said roger friend longer retain 
told proclaimed different blood spaniards quite understand motives two reasons case must time return capital 
people would look upon scorn retain friend one regard countryman men outraged us 
moreover wish stay 
told cortez charged acquaint state feeling city remain would placed painful position either giving information would ruin plans deceiving man nominally serve 
know would say nothing fail spaniards triumph cortez would accuse traitor would put death 
therefore think ways best return present 
course inform cortez sent back feeling white men account treatment emperor great felt could protect fury 
quite agree cacama 
position become painful one 
abhor much doings spaniards perfectly ready avow belong another nation join enterprise 
told cacama said would cut chance ever able return country 
ready accept roger said firmly 
marrying sister shall become one ready cast lot altogether 
prince silent minute two 
roger think plan best 
say spaniards would placed guard save strength arm could aid little enterprise 
moreover return spaniards shall satisfaction fall ruin comes upon house take care sister wife also protector 
reasons therefore better go 
aught attempted spaniards take care give notice leave disguise come avoid fate 
although roger feelings would led throw lot openly spaniards saw cacama plan best 
boat ordered got readiness painful parting amenche wept bitterly roger left palace accompanied cuitcatl order ensure safety across lake taken mexico 
sought presence cortez marina explained cacama sent back fearing excited state population harm might come 
since tezcuco sent letter across day cortez saying tranquil young king pursuing ordinary round court ceremonial certainly far could learn taking steps whatever towards interfering affairs capital although imprisonment montezuma evidently made painful impression upon 
cortez asked questions left room said marina young fellow must watched marina 
brought people must extent feel 
know friend see say nothing public affairs 
let kept wholly dark plans intentions 
cacama next montezuma powerful important aztec chiefs 
young energetic although badly treated montezuma resents treatment 
otherwise would probably ere made propositions us sancho closer alliance us understanding territories montezuma taken shall returned

aztecs willing enough act spies keep us informed going 
hitherto reports agreed sancho sending young fellow back cacama may intending act us 
cacama indeed lost time setting work began form league many leading nobles rescue emperor destroy spaniards 
montezuma brother cuitlahua many others agreed join greater part aztec nobles hung back upon ground like move matter without orders emperor 
refusal prevented general rising taking place thus destroyed last chance mexico retaining independence 
cortez learned spies going would marched tezcuco montezuma dissuaded telling cacama powerful prince would certainly aided many chiefs enterprise would hazardous extreme 
cortez endeavored negotiate received haughty answer cacama 
tried threats asserting supremacy spanish emperor 
cacama replied acknowledged authority knew nothing spanish sovereign people wish know anything 
cortez invited cacama come mexico discuss differences cacama faith spanish loyalty replied visit capital would rescue well emperor common gods bondage
