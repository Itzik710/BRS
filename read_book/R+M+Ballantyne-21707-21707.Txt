chapter one 
forest leaders folorn hope good shot consultation ice floe narrow chance escape small way 
hallo shouted voice rang glades forest like blast silver trumpet testifying lungs leather throat brass 
ringing tones died away naught heard save rustling leafy canopy overhead young man whose shout thus rudely disturbed surrounding echoes leaned muzzle long rifle stood motionless statue right foot resting trunk fallen tree head bent slightly one side listening reply 
reply came 
squirrel ran trunk neighbouring pine paused tail ears erect little black eyes glittering surprise temerity recklessly dared intrude upon desecrate powerful voice deep solitudes wilderness 
stood long thus seemed though little animal man petrified unwonted sound 
spell quickly broken 
loud report fowling piece heard short distance 
squirrel incontinently disappeared spot stood almost instantaneously reappeared topmost branch high tree young man gave smile satisfaction threw rifle shoulder turning round strode rapidly away direction whence shot proceeded 
minutes walk brought banks little brook side projecting root tree sat man dead goose feet fowling piece side

well well believe lad right replied stanley smile smoothed firm lines gathered round lips seconds 
doubt care little anticipated dangers expedition men living hesitate go simply know life lonely one way place ungava 
help frank interests company must attended go must willing willing 
annoyed unexpected difficulty mighty difference men volunteer go men go merely must help 
young man slowly rubbed stock rifle sleeve coat looked understood sympathised friend chagrin

fellows want bold hearty comrade step forward show way follow north pole need 
look upon willingness go mere matter course though see expected like banishment 
prince well well prince must best without said stanley 
spoke trumpet note goose heard distance 
goes exclaimed frank darting suddenly behind stump tree companion crouched beside began shout top voices imitation goose 
bird foolish enough accept invitation immediately although goose would easily recognized sound wretched counterfeit goose language 
flew directly towards geese always spring thus enticed passed distance elder sportsman induced lower piece 
ah far 
better give shot rifle frank sure miss hit mean cried companion flushing momentary indignation disparaging remark 
moment took rapid aim fired

throwing dead bird stooped gave light bark powerful shove stream exclaiming strike time lose go round woods 
indeed time lose 
huge mass ice closing rapidly mouth creek narrowing passage canoe could escape open water river beyond 
stanley might indeed drag canoe bank disposed reach home circuitous walk woods would lose much time necessity carrying gun blanket tin kettle goose back 
broad shoulders admirably adapted burden preferred canoe woods present occasion 
besides risk ran getting canoe crushed pieces 
plunging paddle vigorously water shot lessening channel like arrow swept bosom broad river ice closed crash upon shore ground powder rocks 
well done shouted frank wave cap witnessed success friend exploit 
right replied stanley glancing shoulder 
another moment canoe disappeared behind group willows grew point river mouth young man left alone 
minutes stood contemplating point behind companion disappeared giving hasty glance priming rifle threw across shoulder striding rapidly bank soon lost view amid luxuriant undergrowth forest

chapter four 
explanatory dry murderous designs thwarted vigorous treatment cattle pay preparations long long voyage 
order render story intelligible necessary say words explanatory nature object expedition referred foregoing chapters 
many years previous opening tale deemed expedient rulers hudson bay fur company effect possible reconciliation treaty peace muskigon indians james bay esquimaux hudson straits 
muskigons means warlike race contrary naturally timid plucked courage make war northern neighbors consequence poor people destitute firearms supplied guns ammunition fur traders 
esquimaux however much superior muskigon indians physically would held adversaries light esteem met equal terms indeed terms evil never met 
indians always took surprise behind rocks bushes sent destruction camps deadly bullet helpless foes could reply comparatively harmless arrow spear 
thus war fact annual raid murderers 
conceited muskigons returned wigwams triumph bloody scalps hanging belts esquimaux pushed farther ice bound fastnesses told comrades lowering brows heaving bosoms sudden attack wives children butchered cold blood led captive tents cowardly red men 
times untutored inhabitants frozen regions vowed vengeance indians cursed hearts white men supplied deadly gun 
curse unmerited 
councils fur traders subject esquimau wrongs mooted plans amelioration condition devised 
trading posts established richmond gulf little whale river owing circumstances unnecessary detail turned failures length abandoned 
still charge districts around hudson bay labrador continued use every argument prevail indians cease murderous assaults unoffending neighbors without much effect 
length governor east main territory lying eastern shores james bay adopted argument proved eminently successful least one season 
fort visited large band muskigons albany moose districts brought quantity valuable furs demanded guns ammunition making secret intention proceed expedition enemies esquimaux 
hearing governor went voice extreme indignation assured ounce supplies purpose 
pay ask 
beggars exclaimed astonished indians whose calculations never entered white traders would refuse good furs merely order prevent death esquimaux 
see cried angry governor snatching nearest bale furs see care payment hurling pack owner head felled therewith ground 
continued shaking fist give much powder shot would blow tail rabbit bring skins labrador consequence vigorous conduct indians retired crestfallen utterly discomfited 
camp night plotted revenge 
darkness night slaughtered cattle around establishment daybreak hills far away direction hunting grounds loaded fresh beef sufficient supply families winter heavy price pay poor esquimaux remained unmolested year indians received salutary lesson 
compulsory peace soon broken became apparent effectual way check bloodthirsty propensity indians arm enemies gun 
destruction first expedition esquimaux bad feeling existed minds natives richmond gulf consequent thereon induced fur traders fix another locality new attempt 
thought remote solitudes ungava bay extreme north labrador white man axe never yet felled stunted pines north ring rifle disturbed echoes would spot best suited erection wooden fort 
accordingly appointed mr george stanley select coadjutor proceed party picked men scene action early spring ice would permit build fort best could best materials could find live whatever country afforded shape food establish trade oil whalebone arctic foxes etcetera etcetera got bring reconciliation esquimaux indians interior possible 
careful minuteness peculiar documents stanley instructions went point start moose two half sized canoes capable carrying ten pieces packages pounds weight besides crew bore ice ice would allow till reach richmond gulf cross gulf ascend practicable rivers fall height land supposed positively known exist somewhere interior 
passing height descend rivers lakes existed leading eastward fall upon river reported exist lands called natives caniapuscaw south river proceed scene labors ungava bay reaching considerately left unaided guidance discretion reduced lowest term widest signification instructions directed friend start early could chose liked travel fast possible terra incognita land ice perhaps also desolation locate among bloody savages 
hoped would found sufficiency trees wherewith build shelter prolonged winter meantime might enjoy bright arctic summer sky canopy known least supposed esquimaux fierce cruel savages cannibals 
name implies something sort 
signifies eaters raw flesh bestowed enemies muskigons 
call innuit men warriors although certainly eat raw flesh necessity compels often asserted never choice 
however may remembrance misdeeds first expeditions fresh minds men service fur traders evinced decided unwillingness venture country among people unwillingness length overcome mrs stanley little daughter heroically volunteered share dangers expedition manner already narrated

parbleu shall indeed start morrow please ice wind polar regions blowed coast crammed river mouth 
c est vrai chapter five 
ice looks unpropitious start important member party nearly forgotten chimo 
stanley forebodings massan prognostications proved partly incorrect following morning 
mouth river sea beyond quite full ice loose intersected directions lanes open water 
moreover wind 
gray light early morning brightened dawn first clear ray rising sun swept scene beautiful ever filled fancy imaginative poet temperate zones 
sky perfectly unclouded surface sea completely covered masses ice whose tops pure white like snow sides delicate greenish blue dull frosted appearance forming striking contrast surrounding water shone sun glanced upon like burnished silver 
masses ice varied endlessly form size flat large like fields others square cornered like bastions towers miniature temple spires minarets crystal fortress embrasures battlements midst thousands broken fragments varied outlines larger masses appearing like smaller houses cottages villas floating city ice

chapter six 
character partially developed ducks supper threatened nip bundled ice 
fortunately wind veered round south east soon departure canoes moose fort although enough ruffle surface river effect checking influx ice james bay 
tide began ebb progress canoes even rapid appeared long sun set past point mouth river coasting along shores salt ocean 
outside sea covered hummocks fields ice ever anon met cross currents caused river violent shock 
close shore however thickness ice caused strand leaving lane open water along canoes proceeded easily depth water much sufficient largest canoe draw foot 
sometimes however space blocked smaller fragments considerable difficulty experienced steering canoes amongst 
party traveled boats would easily dashed many checks canoes far otherwise 
bark sides easily broken seams covered kind pitch becomes brittle ice cold water chips large lumps slightest touch 
sea therefore boats best comes carrying craft waterfalls mountain sides days weeks together canoes useful owing lightness

gorgeous scene worthy great creator mysterious working scatters gems beauty oftentimes places scarce single human eye behold excellence 
although sea covered ice nevertheless several lanes open water far shore stanley called council composed frank morton dick prince massan agreed unanimously attempt proceed 
well advanced many miles winding way cautiously among canals open water doubled promontory beyond little ice seen merely scattered fragments fields served enhance beauty scene airy lightness appearance contrast bright blue sea sky interrupt progress travellers 
three canoes always maintained relative positions journey much possible 
say frank two indians went first small canoe lead way two large canoes kept abreast open water wide enough permit 
besides sociable enabled two crews join chorus beautiful songs frequently enlivened voyage 
day many days following continued enjoy fine weather make rapid progress 
sometimes ice pretty thick twice narrowly escaped nipped collapsing masses caused jump hastily throw baggage ice haul canoes water 
occasions men proved sterling fellows nearly cool prompt collected moment danger 
doubt exceptions 
la roche sudden crisis danger arose usually threw blindly side canoe ice lightness agility harlequin 
recked whether came head feet nearly broke neck consequence precipitancy 
la roche coward instant first burst excitement rushed render effective assistance 
bryan although mercurial la roche apt lose self command five minutes sudden danger assailed frequently sat still staring wildly straight others actively unloading canoes danger critical usual sat till canoe empty paid attention prompt gruff order jump ashore seized strong arms gaspard tossed canoe like puppy dog 
occasions invariably endeavored make fault displaying recovery outrageous daring amount unnecessary recklessness uttering time amazing number strange expressions among tare ages och murder several others less lucid signification predominated 
chimo always first ashore instantly wheeled round greet eda also always second thanks strong prompt arm francois sat front tacit agreement took special charge 
mrs stanley arm rightfully shield many scene danger proved ever ready able succor first volunteer ungava 
times sea quite free ice many miles soon added space separated little band adventurers rest human world 
encampments varied according nature coast sometimes among pine trees surrounded dwarf willows times bare sand sea shore occasionally extremity long projecting capes promontories pitch tent make beds clefts solid rock 
wherever laid rest rock sand within shade forest always found mrs stanley remarked first night encampment extremely comfortable eminently snug 
successful procuring ample supply fresh provisions 
ducks geese various kinds innumerable quantities plover cormorants gulls eider ducks eggs found thousands 
many birds good food eggs especially eider duck excellent 
reindeer also met among trophies skill hunter frank one day brought black bear parts eaten great gusto esquimaux indians immense disgust bryan expressed belief haythens barely fit live justly locked society thim dissolate polar raygeons 
many seals also sea put ugly grotesque heads ever anon gazed canoes huge fishy eyes surprise sight novel marine monsters sank slowly beneath wave 
animals never molested respect feelings two indians believed gods assured stanley destruction one would infallibly bring ill luck disaster heads party 
stanley smiled inwardly gave orders seals shot order willing obey require animals either food purpose 
several white polar bears seen also spared require great deal shot kill hit exactly behind ear besides neither bodies skins use travellers 
thus went favourably time

weather beginning change 
dick prince whose black eye ever roving observantly told massan storm brewing sooner put ashore convenient spot better 
stanley anxious get long journey termination would little enough time erect sufficient protection winter north continued advance along shore came point beyond deep bay would take many hours coast 
making traverse however direct line next point might cross much shorter time 
say prince shall cross asked stanley rested paddles cast furtive glances dark clouds across still quiet bay

considerable time men strained every nerve gain wished point land little success became evident would never reach 
men began show signs flagging cast uneasy glances towards stanley lost hope accomplishing object waited suggest 
poor mrs stanley sat holding gunwale one hand clasping edith round waist gazed wistfully towards cape ahead almost lost view shadow dark cloud rolled towards like black pall laden destruction 
god help us murmured stanley undertone scanned seaward horizon covered leaden clouds streaks lurid light beneath foaming sea leaped furiously

frank directed course obliquely river towards island already alluded stanley proceeded current towards narrows beyond expected catch sight sea 
passing island found low thinly covered vegetation scrubby bushes frank men pushed side proceeded carefully examine coast 
found much left 
narrow belt sandy shingly beach extended along margin river might appropriately termed lake least far appearance went 
strip belt indented numerous bays inlets many places intersected rocky capes jutted mountains 
mountains bare precipitous rising abruptly like side edge sand ascending succession terraces whose faces steep almost impossible scale

first gullies exploring party landed found remains esquimau summer encampment

moreover stanley begged send several best dogs saying would purchase want team hauling winter firewood 
next day stanley engaged trading store party esquimaux surprised hearing volley musketry fired back fort

esquimaux promised obedience stanley ascended promenade taking indian chief hand led towards fort followed whole band single file

although traders reason congratulate far succeeded establishment peace could conceal fact one hand esquimaux appeared perfectly sincere cordial professions hand indians evinced good deal taciturnity first even reserve overcome seemed act men constrained performance distasteful action

evening day stanley much difficulty overcoming reserve indians procure information regarding interior hearts opened influence tobacco condescended give required information 
effect many fur bearing animals immediate vicinity ungava good many wooded country lying southward eastward 
however indians care hunt preferring rather keep heights land near coast deer numerous 
fact stanley afterwards found facility indians procured deer part country serious drawback fur trade contented trapping enough otters foxes etcetera enable procure supply ammunition hunt deer 
indians brought beaver furs trade receiving good meal presents took quarters plot ground close fort

oh esquimaux lying dead sand gasped edith laid head mother breast rest gone 
without waiting hear frank stanley took guns hastened camp

maximus telling knows matter reports vague event must occurred occurred child 
possibly frank 
know moravians settlements along coasts labrador eastward 
may made attempt long ago push far 
always high opinion energy perseverance missionaries get incongruity strange way mingling trade religion 
seems unnatural sort thing missionaries fur traders 
mean object system however daresay works well means judging 
strange replied frank yet seems good plan 
missionaries trade order may live preach 
twould good thing indian country principles practice actuated traders difference instead missionaries becoming fur traders fur traders would become missionaries 
seem species infatuation continued frank energetically warmed subject men calling christians live years years among poor indians america never name great saving name christ 
course wonder make little profession christianity men fur trade seem deeply impressed truths god word alive fact name heaven given among men whereby saved except name christ know feel indians around living without god therefore without hope world feel christ christian religion however perfect beautiful code morals utterly worthless salvation unless heart special love jesus christ men admit profess believe yet never speak christ natives never mention name alone save eternal destruction 
hasty frank replied stanley 
agree strange indeed see hear missionary spirit among traders one take words deserved rebuke say many among us deeply impressed truths god word know never mention saviour name indians although fur traders mount pulpit may private make mention name amount good fully known trader trapper indian shall stand side side judgment seat christ 
observe say actually case suggest possible may add probable may returned frank may god forgive judged men fur trade unjustly certainly know one made somewhat profession christianity day yet done next nothing one frank morton 
gainsay frank said stanley quiet smile think likely err much apply censure 
curious thinking subject
