species lovely scenery england holds none perhaps exquisite banks chalk rivers perfect limpidity water gay luxuriant vegetation banks ditches masses noble wood embosoming villages unique beauty water meadows living sheets emerald silver tinkling sparkling cool fiercest sun brilliant blackest clouds 
anywhere one would expected find arcadia among fertility loveliness industry wealth 
alas sad reality cool breath glittering water meadows often floats laden poisonous miasma 
picturesque villages generally perennial hotbeds fever ague squalid penury sottish profligacy dull discontent stale words 
luxury park wealth huge farm steadings knowledge parsonage poor whose dull labor luxury wealth ay even knowledge made possible shall see please god ere story end

single fact struck perhaps deeply connected many physiological fancies parent many thoughts plans life 
could distinguish half sentence 
old shrunken man opposite drawing figures spilt beer pipe stem discoursing glorious times great war food mouths work hands
