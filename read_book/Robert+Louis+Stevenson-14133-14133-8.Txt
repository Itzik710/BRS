may sure touch welcome topic sat time midst learned counsel almost deaved talk extremely little wiser purport 
writer led hot expressions colstoun must take set right rest joined different sides pretty noisy duke argyle beaten like blanket king george came digs going great deal rather elaborate defense one person seemed forgotten james glens 
mr miller sat quiet 
slip oldish gentleman ruddy twinkling spoke smooth rich voice infinite effect pawkiness dealing word way actor give expression possible even silent sat wig laid aside glass hands mouth funnily pursed chin seemed mere picture merry slyness 
plain word say waited fit occasion 
came presently 
colstoun wound one speeches expression duty client 
brother sheriff pleased suppose transition 
took table confidence gesture look 
suggests consideration seems overlooked said 
interest client goes certainly world come end james stewart 
whereat cocked eye 
might condescend exempli gratia upon mr george brown mr thomas miller mr david balfour 
mr david balfour good ground complaint think gentlemen story properly red think would number wigs green 
whole table turned common movement 
properly handled carefully red story could scarcely fail consequence continued 
whole administration justice highest officer downward would totally discredited looks would need replaced 
seemed shine cunning said 
need point ye mr balfour would remarkable bonny cause appear added 
well started another hare mr balfour cause kind speeches could delivered officials could thus turned would succeed positions 
shall give two specimens 
proposed approach symon fraser whose testimony could obtained could prove certainly fatal argyle prestongrange

ay hardly prove politics meaning friend said gratified miller 
revolution like think promise historical writers shall date mr balfour cause 
properly guided mr stewart tenderly guided shall prove peaceful revolution 
damned campbells get ears rubbed care cries stewart smiting fist 
thought well pleased though could scarce forbear smiling kind innocency old intriguers 
view undergone many sorrows advancement sheriff miller make revolution parliament house interposed accordingly much simplicity manner could assume 
thank gentlemen advice said would like leave set two three questions 
one thing fallen rather one side instance cause good friend james glens seemed hair set back gave various answers concurring practically one point james hope king mercy 
proceed said good scotland saying ill bird fouls nest 
remember hearing riot edinburgh infant child gave occasion late queen call country barbarous always understood rather lost gained 
came year forty five made scotland talked everywhere never heard said anyway gained forty five 
come cause mr balfour call 
sheriff miller tells us historical writers date would wonder 
fear would date period calamity public reproach 
nimble witted miller already smelt traveling made haste get road 
forcibly put mr balfour says 
weighty observe sir 
next ask good king george pursued 
sheriff miller appears pretty easy upon doubt scarce able pull house without majesty coming knock two one might easily prove fatal 
gave chance answer none volunteered 
case profitable went sheriff miller gave us names several among good enough mention mine 
hope pardon think otherwise 
believe hung least back affair life saved thought extremely hazarded think would pity young man idea coming bar ingrain upon character turbulent factious fellow yet twenty 
james seems date proceedings sentence good pronounced hope king mercy 
may majesty pointedly addressed characters high officers sheltered public kept position think spells ruin sat gazed glasses could see found attitude affair unpalatable 
miller ready events 
may allowed put young friend notion formal shape says understand propose embody fact sequestration perhaps heads testimony prepared offer memorial crown 
plan elements success 
likely perhaps likelier help client 
perhaps majesty would goodness feel certain gratitude concerned memorial might construed expression delicate loyalty think drafting view might brought forward 
nodded without sighs former alternative doubtless inclination 
paper mr stewart please pursued miller think might fittingly signed five us present procurators condemned man 
none us harm least says colstoun heaving another sigh seen lord advocate last ten minutes 
thereupon set enthusiastically draft memorial process course soon caught fire ado sit looking answer occasional question 
paper well expressed beginning recitation facts reward offered apprehension surrender pressure brought bear upon sequestration arrival inverary time late going explain reasons loyalty public interest agreed waive right action winding forcible appeal king mercy behalf james 
methought good deal sacrificed rather represented light firebrand fellow cloud lawyers restrained difficulty extremes 
let pass made one suggestion described ready deliver evidence adduce others commission inquiry one demand immediately furnished copy
