chapter xviii happened next giles left churchyard slowly brain whirl 
anne departed hot haste taking shelter hiding place dare follow unless wanted discovered 
never knew whose footsteps startled away 
left remained quite ten minutes kind dazed condition 
footsteps heard 
intent upon anne flight amazing things told noticed ceased 
occurred retreated though person listening hastily gone away

whether scarlet cross indicates political society symbol thieves association said giles say steel certain ground 
alfred denham walter franklin whatever chooses call evidently bad lot 
sufficient love daughter keep iniquities anne much dark 
quite believe thinks father innocent saved spur moment 
guilty 
giles proceeded work case presented 
walter franklin found convenient call scoundrel preyed society mischance pure good daughter like anne 
keep knowing bad man apparently valued affection sent governess 
believed knowing plotting get powell money 
certainly walter resided florence name denham 
ware quite believed guessed order keep eye brother george inherit powell money 
probably knew beforehand powell ill feigned death might carry scheme without anne knowledge 
scheme impersonate brother giles trembled think proposed get rid george time ripe 
must intended murder since slain daisy little compunction certainly would stick second crime 
however thus giles argued first step secure money feign death thus get rid anne 
came london wilson stopped mrs benker order spy ashers alexander 
soon knew certain powell dead money coming daisy came rickwell errand serving summons lured girl outside church kill 
anne following would disappeared night one would wiser 
appearance daughter library upset plans

giles remembered time flight anne really believed father guilty 
events made use get away thus reached yacht gravesend 
waiting order might fly crime committed 
perhaps intended walk tilbury crossing thames get board yacht hue cry 
anne hampered plans measure means stolen motor car assisted 
thus man got away murder girl opened way george inheriting money 
went paris mused giles florence 
daresay walter intended send anne away excuse murder brother florence 
could slip dead man shoes come inherit george property powell 
probably george left florence walter arrived thus escaped death 
safe far long safe terrible thought occurred giles 
wondered walter placed daughter priory opportunity coming see brother thus seizing chance killing 
anne innocent real meaning terrible schemes might decoy 
father came george would murdered 
walter able disguise infernal ingenuity might slip dead man shoes thus money schemed would come 
evidently last act tragedy yet played 
giles puzzled matter bewildered became 
could see thought done could guess last act carried 
yet walter franklin hiding somewhere waiting pounce unsuspecting brother second crime might involve anne still deeper nefarious transactions father 
finally giles made mind seek george franklin priory tell thought
