esmond 
thought reference brookfield letters several searches find 
mother speaks book grand melancholy lady stanley cut throat melancholy 
said sold thousand pounds sum master shallow lent falstaff probably inferior security 
knew thought well wholly surprising 
still perhaps possession success rather esteem affection 
company young men maidens long ago submitted pronounced one two exceptions inferior work humor 
hitting little harry eye potato admitted humorous hardly anything else 
representing another generation another point view faithful dr john brown wholly like esmond marriage rachel love beatrix apparently fly ointment 
even author could plead deal pains goes nothing says one rare published references subject wrong 
undoubtedly mere taking pains taken right manner right person right subject 
everything right accordingly went everything 
greater novel esmond know know many greater books 
may melancholy none worse grand 
though may much humor potato throwing sort esmond perhaps found book thackeray one else deeper higher humor takes life province humor humanity absolutely pervading 
may found likewise least book found constant intertwist passion humanity higher representatives goes humor hand hand loving yet mutually critical pair 
extraordinarily difficult form autobiography know another masterly presentment difficult recognize means mastery attained though heaven knows easy understand skill applied 
success fact result curious doubleness amounting fact something like triplicity distinguishes thackeray attitude handling 
thus henry esmond whole say like characters though course romanced little fellow also human criticism 
times tolerably unsophisticated account actions may even thoughts another thoughts actions present might present another mind yet times reasoned view impartial historian 
mixed form narrative mono drama lends nothing else could author well known much discussed sometimes heartily abused habit parabasis soliloquy audience 
nothing yet directly said anything said would repeated every novel may well keep last late example virginians philip 
efficacy peculiar kind double treble handling almost indisputable even may dispute legitimacy constantly applied method 
one result however regards hero spokesman curious 
believe thoroughly henry esmond one real illustrious henrys well thackeray characters reality rather different kind fellows 
somewhat abstract typical generalized reality english heroes usually 
least shadowy allegoric still somehow esmondity well esmond melancholy rather melancholy clearsighted aloofminded man 
heart head act governing powers passion humor sketched acting 
man never likely successful famous fortunate world generally called happy man yet enjoying constant glows glimmers cloudy happiness would hardly exchange light 
late professor masson posture monger man megrims one genial temper steady sense described thackeray man apart marquis esmond 
yet thackeray real man marquis

onslow square brompton thackeray lived 
element abstraction disappears rather retires background pass beatrix 
also ewigweibliche much almost shakespeare women therefore anybody else much type beatrix esmond flesh blood damask diamond born destruction mankind fortunately delight well 
beatrix beyond eulogy 
cease cease sing praise really motto though perhaps something may said come terrible pendant thackeray courage skill draw truth without disgusting result 
died esmond closes doubt whether wood fair ladies even cleopatra would dared summon side lest comparison favourable enough throne shared 
usual thackeray must look hero heroine exclusively even heroine 
another heroine cause dubieties doctor fidelis cited may perhaps pointed extreme sentimentalists harry love mother well daughter along 
consider aggravation helped except extreme point view miss marianne dashwood earlier stage ought rather considered palliative 
say thing made worse still fact harry rachel second love exactly wait widow fell love nothing confess shocking excessively human 
indeed fact rachel human beatrix though different way 
may love less different sense contrast roman poet like little less 
knowledge human nature call unnatural 
really know third lady family isabel marchioness esmond though less written real almost wonderful two 
fairly treated however poor thing bernstein period without beatrix one 
lords castlewood thomas francis p et fils creator taken much trouble never 
least piece think rachel fortunate unfortunate husband 
people regard ibsen great triumph doll house consisting conduct husband incriminating documents ought admire thackeray management temporary loss rachel beauty 
certainly touches baser side human nature ingeniously worked 
question wonderful book ingeniously worked character incident description speech champions unity wise would take esmond battle horse certain great parts whole greater almost one certainly case pendennis 
certain parts personages hero heroine stand commandingly certainly case pendennis 
unity however peculiar kind differs ordinary non classical unity interest thackeray almost invariably exhibits 
rather unity temper also present pervading motto vanitas vanitatum almost necessitates books reaches transcendence elsewhere attained 
brooding spirit ecclesiastes covers shadow one wings joys sorrows failures successes private family friends fates england europe fortunes marlborough swift way dictatorship case dotage death big wars notable literary triumphs well hopeless passions acquiescent losses 
thus instance greatest revival historical novel taking place novel scott simpler though simple sometimes thought dashed far heavier dose novel element opposed romance yet without abandonment romance quality proper 
novel romance scenes may called famous mock duel end course greatest 
duke hamilton acknowledge marquis esmond beatrix gives kiss beatrix almost great many others 
possible transcendence accounts extent somewhat lukewarm admiration received 
usual devotee novel analysis dislikes historic taught consider childish common lover romance better kind feels hampered character study mile de girardin subscribers felt hampered gautier style 
happier make best dispensations nothing however yet said one salient characteristics esmond one perhaps much love lovers qualified esteem quite love anything else 
course attempt certainly audacious one give form pressure time story sometimes actual diction yet suffuse modern thought color certainly time 
boldness peril attempt quite indisputable peril way double 
malcontent say may fine like 
bothers teases 
want talked language addison steele 
possibly less ingenuous obtrusive malcontent say ought never done done well 
first probably exists squadrons gross bands argument course impossible 
may taught better caught young certainly last thing honest lover literature would wish would make say likes thing 
may left preach follow fashions moment 
perhaps much say double attempt successful except disable judgement 
doctrine attempt deserves fail must fail wrong one may take cudgels confidence 
far anything illegitimate attempt bring one period eyes another habit lived speaking spoke allow eyes move move see see merely triumph justification whole method prose fiction general historical novel particular 
historical novel result growth historic sense acting upon demand fiction 
long people made attempt understand things thoughts different around within long like men middle ages blandly threw everything image like renaissance extent augustan period still regarded ages worst contempt best indulgence childish historical novel could come 
became possible history began seriously studied something chronicle external events 
thus made possible perfectly legitimate experiment carry process still merely discuss moralize represent period without forfeiting privilege regarding point view reached 
process thackeray really unfolding carrying application method shakespeare 
partly date partly genius partly dramatic necessities obliged shakespeare combine treatment make godlike romans roman elizabethan men time men time 
thackeray conveniences novel demands audience dichotomizes presentation observing certain unity fictitious person henry esmond william makepeace thackeray 
anybody like result nothing said 
regard one furthest explorations yet possess human genius one extraordinary achievements higher imagination coleridge liked call esenoplastic 
man faculty reproducing contemporary general life wonderful faculty reproducing past life wonderful still 
thus revive past preserve present command provide theater company audience performance highest wizardry 
seems thackeray attempted done history henry esmond 
could done without pains refers saying quoted pains usual bore fruit 
thought desirable include present volume two main crops english humourists four georges 
exactly early thackeray attention drawn eighteenth century would necessarily incomplete state biographical information difficult say 
pointed connexion pretty well established early catherine 
evidently founded upon peculiar congeniality freshened enlivened proper dose difference certain source purest maintainer love life literature 
time two sets lectures differentiated novel much form thackeray lecturer little smacked platform novelist great deal smacked satiric conversation scene purport 
esmond though partly critical mainly far greater part creative 
lectures though partly creative resurrective rate professedly substantially critical 
good deal said already thackeray qualities defects critic pointed consequence peculiar impulsiveness strong likes dislikes satiric romantic temperament perhaps certain deficiencies round literary historical learning critical light apt rather uncertain critical deductions means things appeal 
english humourists far important place criticism literary department four georges book snobs extent supplementing chief place criticism society personality like 
moreover violently attacked like 
reasons one two works deserve faithful critical handling 
always best disperse maleger myrmidons exploring beauties house alma may take objections humourists first 
chiefly concerned handling swift less degree sterne 
quite certain first case rate confess though means avoid 
instance excessive taking sides characters noticed noticed 
reason least difficult perceive 
doubtful whether thackeray estimate average humanity much higher swift quite certain affection swift professed one instance seems really felt dick tom harry particular opposed mankind large much less sincere thackeray individuals 
temperament one deepened aggravated general understanding mankind furious misanthropy temperament softened general pardon 
way swift love friendship dangerous harsh faced thackeray sunny caressing 
little doubt thackeray shadow vanity heaviest felt danger actual misanthropy thus revolted victim kind terror nature could help feeling similar revulsion swift harsh ways 
revulsion gives undue force expression need denied must remembered allow affect literary judgement 
believe one living greater admiration swift say know estimate genius anywhere adequate thackeray sterne intend say much 
thrust personality literature sterne constantly must take chances personality well literature 
practically expose judgement public 
anybody chooses take cudgels sterne personality shall hand take part one side another bout 
genius think thackeray unjust 
fact however usual persons genius even usual defects qualities intimately connected one without must pay price one 
say another live piece english criticism english literature know anywhere 
alive seldom perfect get perfection must go epitaphs 
though could pick plenty small holes details actual critical dicta know picture division literature concerned fairly intelligent person derive better impression facts 
addison may little depressed steele little exalted necessary remember macaulay whose estimate practically held field steele unduly depressed addison rather unduly exalted 
may go among critics brightest day largest lantern find nothing brilliant congreve article spice injustice deceive nobody fool 
vividness addison steele presentation miraculous 
redresses johnson prior redressed macaulay steele unjust might feared would pope 
hogarth smollett fielding another miracle appreciation like ask objectors sentimentality means intense sympathy impossible exclude something may called sentimental study goldsmith could produced goldsmith one difficult persons whole range literature treat motley merits weaknesses 
yet thackeray achieved adventure 
short throughout book invaluable critic impeccable criticism 
faults causes obvious separable negligible merits chief usual constant shower happy illuminative phrase rare quality abundant quantity 
lectures english humourists must composed much pari passu esmond delivered finished published author setting deliver america 
four georges regularly taken hand till years later newcomes finished finishing fresh material wanted second american trip 
exists remarkable scenario may almost called full decade older shape satura verse prose contributed punch october accordingly kept back original associates inserted 
things considered gives lines followed later lectures remarkable precision improbable thackeray actually though necessity consciously took head notes 
book violently attacked time appearance since 
reader must seen long ago present writer though proud called thackerayan stalwart thackerayan know nothing thackeray right wrong man exposes attack 
strictly literary side indeed advantage book snobs nowhere unequal exhibits author unmatched power historical artistic imagination reconstruction almost highest degree possible 
respects certainly show omission erect sconce drumsnab 
already hinted connexion eastern journey curious innocence thackeray 
may like hind feared danger knew sin absence fear implied apparent ignoring danger danger 
nobody even passed responsions study literary moral character suspect one moment pandered american prejudice prating tit bit primeur scandal king george 
quite evident first ought evident author long beforehand enemy might think would say 
fact putting considerations mere expediency aside think much better done 
justice general verdict doubt affected throughout thackeray political incapacity whatever side might taken quaint theoretical republicanism good deal pure toryism mixed attributes characters doubt kind rather confused speculative way held 
certainly puts george iii ability low certainly indulges case george iv one curious outbursts hetze unreasoning frantic stop thief mad dog persecution liable 
gorgius may hero proper moral man certainly expensive herr means pattern husband 
recent means pharisaical expositions exhibited wife almost infinitely better allegations treachery private friends whole proven deserted whigs whigs shortly afterwards country played difficult part regent easy one king means ill common even reluctant consent extremely pleasant host companion liked jane austen novels 
good many princes good many demagogues much good could said 
admitting excess details inconvenience circumstances original representation remains seems sufficient balance credit 
social historic sense accompanied literary power bodying forth results noticed early opening catherine seventeen years interval fully marvellously matured 
picture mere mob details orderly pageant artistically composed material 
possible life like question rather minor one true minor say artistic value would remain historical impaired 
think 
shall bow authority persons better acquainted eighteenth century decades familiarity essayists novelists diarists letter writers may give one scanty locus standi shall certainly give testimony favor thackeray extract 
true essence life exhibits fiction pamela joseph andrews pompey little spiritual quixote essay tatler mirror lord chesterfield lady mary horace walpole pope young green churchill cowper boswell wraxall mrs delany madame arblay seems deserve warrant excise guarantee analysis lies four little flaskets
