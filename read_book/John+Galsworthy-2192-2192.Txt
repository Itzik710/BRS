awfully good look 
colonel stared 
something young lennan noticed take liberties look made things difficult 
still lingered staring wistfully young man stood waiting politeness 
safe question shot mind ah go back england tuesday

colonel thought would bad form 
knew take advantage 
yes gentleman lifting hand salute said well must getting back 
see dinner perhaps turning heel marched away 
remembrance face putty stuff side road accompanied home 
bad serious sense counted nothing grew grew 
told one colonel turned ceremony left lennan sat flat stone took putty stuff presently effaced image 
sat still long time appearance watching little blue butterflies playing round red tawny roses 
fingers began work feverishly shaping head man beast sort horned heavy mingling two 
something frenetic movement rather short blunt ended fingers though strangling thing creating 
viii days served country traveled befitted spartans ordinary first class carriages woke morning la roche strange sounding place paler coffee pale brioche

one expedition full ten minutes remained awake wondering tireless immobility 
indeed spending night entranced feeling lennan beside holding hand 
seemed actually feel touch finger tiny patch bare palm glove opened 
wonderful uncanny communion dark rushing night would slept worlds never felt close even kissed olives even concert yesterday arm pressed voice whispered words heard thirstily 
golden fortnight passed passed endless band reminiscence 
memories like flowers scent warmth color none perhaps quite poignant memory moment door carriage said low heard good bye darling never called 
even touch cheek olives equalled simple treasure word 
roar clatter train snoring irishman kept sounding ears hour dark hour 
perhaps wonderful night never looked future face made plans took stock position yielded memory half dreamed sensation presence close beside 
whatever might come afterwards night 
trance gave strange soft tireless immobility moved uncle whenever woke

mrs ercott rose quickly went could follow 
thus suddenly deserted colonel brooded drumming little table 
dolly unjust poor dolly fond ever course could help olive young pretty could help looking wanting save mess thus sat wondering dismayed unreasonableness women 
enter head mrs ercott almost sleepless niece watching closed eyes every one little expeditions saying ah care travel returned serene enough concealing grief soon whirling towards england 
future begun lay hand olive spell past already losing power sense dream grew stronger every minute 
hours would enter little house close shadow old wren church reminded somehow childhood austere father chiselled face 
meeting husband go night care contemplate night 
morrows wherein nothing reasonable complain yet nothing could without feeling friendliness zest color life prisoner 
morrows felt would slip back dream lost hardly perhaps effort

household gods works indeed left twenty days ago seemed exist far might come see come sit chair drink cup let put cushion back footstool feet 
vividly could see lying back chair looking across could hardly believe never yet sat 
odd without resolution taken without admission love could remain platonic without change relations save one humble kiss whispered words everything changed 
month ago wanted would gone calmly house 
would seemed harmless quite natural 
impossible openly least thing strict convention find desirable 
sooner later would find stepping convention take real lover real lover knelt empty chair stretched arms 
substance warmth fragrance nothing longing passed air wind grass 
went little round window overlooked river 
last evening may gloaming water dusk resting trees air warm better moving night ebb flow things among others whose hearts beating stay place without cold meaningless 
lamps passion fruit towns turning pallor full orange stars coming
