felt irritated 
interesting said shrugging shoulders 
care know opinion assure question great interest 
yes yes 
opinion medical relief center malozyomovo quite unnecessary 
irritation infected looked screwing eyes asked necessary landscapes landscapes either 
nothing 
finished taking gloves opened newspaper brought post 
minute later said quietly evidently restraining last week anna died childbirth medical relief center near would lived 
think even landscape painters ought opinions subject 
definite opinion subject assure answered screened newspaper though unwilling listen 
mind schools dispensaries libraries medical relief centres present conditions serve aggravate bondage people 
peasants fettered great chain break chain add fresh links view 
raised eyes smiled ironically went trying formulate leading idea 
matters anna died childbirth annas mavras pelageas toil early morning till dark fall ill working beyond strength lives tremble sick hungry children lives doctored dread death disease fade grow old early die filth stench 
children begin story soon grow goes hundreds years milliards men live worse beasts continual terror mere crust bread 
whole horror position lies never time think souls image semblance 
cold hunger animal terror burden toil like avalanches snow block every way spiritual activity distinguishes man brutes thing makes life worth living 
go help hospitals schools free fetters contrary bind closer bonds introducing new prejudices increase number wants say nothing fact got pay zemstvo drugs books toil harder ever 
going argue said lida putting paper 
heard 
say one thing one sit one hands one lap 
true saving humanity perhaps make great many mistakes right 
highest holiest task civilised serve neighbors try serve best 
like one please every one 
true lida said mother true 
lida presence always little timid looked nervously talked afraid saying something superfluous inopportune 
never contradicted always assented true lida true 
teaching peasants read write books wretched precepts rhymes medical relief centres diminish either ignorance death rate light windows light huge garden said give nothing 
meddling people lives create new wants new demands labor 
ach good heavens one must something said lida vexation tone one could see thought arguments worthless despised 
people must freed hard physical labor said must lighten yoke let time breathe may spend lives stove wash tub fields may also time think souls god may time develop spiritual capacities 
highest vocation man spiritual activity perpetual search truth meaning life 
make coarse animal labor unnecessary let feel free see mockery dispensaries books 
man recognizes true vocation satisfied religion science art trifles 
free labor laughed lida 
possible yes 
take upon share labor 
us townspeople country people without exception would agree divide us labor mankind spends satisfaction physical needs us would perhaps need work two three hours day 
imagine rich poor work three hours day rest time free 
imagine order depend even less upon bodies labor less invent machines replace work try cut needs minimum 
would harden children afraid hunger cold continually trembling health like anna mavra pelagea 
imagine doctor keep dispensaries tobacco factories distilleries lot free time would left us us together would devote leisure science art 
peasants sometimes work whole community together mending roads us community would search truth meaning life convinced truth would discovered quickly man would escape continual agonising oppressive dread death even death 
contradict though said lida 
talk science opposed elementary education 
elementary education man nothing read signs public houses sometimes books understand education existed among us since times rurik gogol petrushka reading ever long yet village days rurik remained 
needed elementary education freedom wide development spiritual capacities 
wanted schools universities 
opposed medicine 
yes 
would necessary study diseases natural phenomena cure 
one must cure diseases causes 
remove principal cause physical labor disease 
believe science cures disease went excitedly 
science art real aim temporary private ends eternal universal seek truth meaning life seek god soul tied needs evils day dispensaries libraries complicate hamper life 
plenty doctors chemists lawyers plenty people read write quite without biologists mathematicians philosophers poets 
whole intelligence whole spiritual energy spent satisfying temporary passing needs 
scientific men writers artists hard work thanks conveniences life multiplied day day 
physical demands increase yet truth still long way man still remains rapacious dirty animal everything tending degeneration majority mankind loss forever fitness life
