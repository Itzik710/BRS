looked across waving grass four roomed shack built upon four corners four eighties four women might live together yet said live upon claims 
drawing line pretty fine course finer happy family would dared draw 
one would raise objection account women timid living alone 
andy smiled sympathetically four conjunctive corners four claims happened lie upon bald pinnacle bare grass shelter water even 
shack stood bleakly revealed four winds also looked benchland rolling half barren land west comprised antelope coulee dry coulee several good nothing coulees capable supporting nothing coyotes prairie dogs gophers 
mile way andy rode stopped upon steep side gulch arm antelope coulee

horsemen come bluff cattle saw sign 
man yawned went breakfast 
many times day stood corner shack glasses sweeping bench land 
toward noon cattle drifted coulee water 
couple hours drifted leisurely back upon high ground scattered feeding still watched tended two horsemen looked harmless individuals 
one fat red faced spent least half time lying prone upon slope shade horse 
thin awkward slouched saddle sat upon ground knees drawn arms clasped loosely around cigarette dangling upon lower lip picture boredom 
nothing whatever indicate events breeding peaceful scene adventure creeping close upon watcher 
went fourth fifth inspection took nap 
night awakened pounding side shack window 
time reached middle floor could count time seconds similar pounding door 
tried open door went window could see nothing although night dark went bed 
shouted reply could hear talking without

heard patsy moving inside brief delay open door 
heard constable ask patsy knew anything irish could found heard patsy declare enough without keeping track boneheaded cowpuncher good nothing fight get schrapes 
heard patsy ask constable breakfast leaving town 
heard certain saddle sounds told dismounting response tacit invitation 
pulling hat firmly upon head irish led horse quietly hollow behind shack sight hearing three sought 
believe wanted anything serious meant arrest probably laying two gamblers chair bottle whisky respectively 
trumped charge likely chiefly calculated make trouble eliminate struggle time 
irish worry reason wanting intend let come close enough state errand want become guilty resisting officer would much worse fighting nesters fists chairs bottles things 
hollow mounted rode depression debouched upon wide grassy coulee lay part claim 
sure intentions constable took granted would presently ride irish cabin search also would look possibly good deal persistence would nuisance would measure hamper movements therefore usefulness irish 
reason resolved take chance could avoided 
sun slid behind scurrying forerunners storm struggled unavailingly shine upon prairie land 
irish could see full extent storm clouds high land absorbed matters pay much attention 
even glance casually inky mass decided would well ride cabin get slicker 
time reached shack storm beating wind turned unexpectedly northeast 
mutterings thunder grew sharper booming 
first real thunderstorm season going hard one looks meant anything 
irish went got slicker put hesitated riding search cattle men pursuit

irish one fight never stand idle mounted turned long suffering horse coulee storm swept 
first large drops rain pattered upon earth left blobs wet fell 
horse shook head impatiently went sidling forward admonitory kick irish sent straight dim trail 
clouds opened recklessly headgates let rain one solid rush water sluiced hillsides drove muddy torrents channels dry since snow left 
irish bent head hat shielded somewhat face rode doggedly 
first time smashing driving thunderstorm would last life went logically planned 
comfortable oft repeated experience 
first fury passed still rained steadily promise let optimism suffered appreciably 
luck town longer cheered 
began feel loss sleep bone weariness fight long ride afterwards 
breakfast one bright spot saved gnawing discomfort empty stomach first 
went one man coulee followed arm would lead rolling ridgy open land beyond breaks badlands reached meet prairie 
came across track herd followed plain 
open however herd seemed split several small bunches going different direction 
puzzled irish little first 
later thought understood 
cattle would seem driven purposefully edge breaks made scatter winding gulches canyons led deeper badlands 
trick range men could believe strange settlers ignorant country conditions would know enough 
hesitated several possible routes rain pouring upon chill breeze driving face 
hoofprints show way boys gone rain washed looked dim old gave little help 
chose seemed gorge boys would likely follow especially night open pursuit driven cattle benchland cattle driven beyond point plain enough otherwise would overtaken stragglers long 
nearing noon came finally upon little open flat found big medicine pink holding bunch perhaps hundred cattle gleaned surrounding gulches little draws led hills 
two wet skin chilled hungry miserable bear sent tree yelping yapping dogs 
big medicine spied first haze falling water galloped heavily toward horse flinging great pads mud feet came 
say bellowed yet hundred yards away

big medicine voice charged incredulous reproach 
n hell yuh doin without grub patsy comin wagon

besides could expected know cattle driven away scattered happy family would overtaken long think mind reader pink biting sarcasm retorted 
took mind read mind 
added looks irish must started home drunk anyway horse wandered far accord 
three four cows started gulch right pink hurling insults shoulder rode turn back 
actually come blows two though near 
big medicine lingered bawl unforgivable things irish irish shouted back recklessly acted like bunch sheepherders cattle would never driven bench 
declared anybody brains sick sage hen would stopped thing right start 
said things also 
big medicine said things reply pink returning scene anger grown considerably hotter feeding upon discomfort made comments pertinent subject irish shortcomings 
may scarcely believe unless really lived learned easily small irritations grow proportions real trouble swiftly fact irish big medicine became enraged dismounted simultaneously irish jerked slicker big medicine running smash needless insult 
fought rain mud chill wind whipped wet cheeks 
fought relentlessly though long enemies senselessly though grown men schoolboys 
clinched pounded smashed pink sickened sight tore apart swore crazy men implored sense

oh busy indeed week spent hunting kid 
found rumor engagement rosemary allen treacherous andy green reached busier still since changed methods careful mask real purpose behind air passive resentment industry became less apparent 
happy family pay much attention florence grace hallman studied opposition 
pretty busy attending affairs andy green busy much love almost forgot existence florence grace except rare occasions met riding prairie trails 
first rounded stock scattered stop crossed antelope coulee settlers cattle 
bedded dark

team work used different game losing game one would say first glance 
far summer favorable dry farming 
enterprising settlers grain planted potatoes upon freshly broken soil growing apace

happy family riding way sometimes heard voices mingled shrill singing hymn year listened hunting song coyote 
eighty acres man climate soil never could make pay soil especially since mostly barren 
happy family knew could find hearts pity men putting dollars time hard work 
obvious reasons put pity speech 
fenced west line record time
