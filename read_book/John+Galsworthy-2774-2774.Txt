lady valleys sighed utter undisguised relief 
well dear boy began even feel must tell surely reason otherwise kept secret 
lord valleys interrupted glad would point connection honor resignation seat said stiffly 
miltoun shook head 
see already would useless 
see 
whole matter unfortunate give work long absolute necessity seems far fetched absurd 
many men whose lives entered relation one time another idea would disqualify half nation 
eyes seemed crisis consult avoid wife though asking endorsement point view observing proprieties 
moment midst anxiety sense humor got better lady valleys 
funny geoff give away could life help fixing eyes 
dear murmured underestimate three quarters least lord valleys confronted danger growing steadier

suddenly far following music two cuckoos flew across seeking thorn trees moor 
watching arrowy birds caught sight someone coming towards clump beech trees suddenly saw mrs noel rode forward flushing

dinner night men left dining hall miltoun slipped away den 
present little church seemed unemotional moved 
though quiet private wedding resented cheap festivity accompanying passing young sister 
would ceremony little dark disused chapel court two priest alone

changing swallow tail old smoking jacket went lawn

moon stars wind cattle noiseless trees owls calling night jars churring fly night chafers abroad 
stream alone alive quiet darkness 
miltoun followed wispy line gray path cleaving dim glamour daisies buttercups came feeling presence sleep eternal waiting 
sound footfalls seemed desecration 
devotional hush burning spicy incense millions leaves blades grass 
crossing last stile came close deserted cottage lime tree night courtier adventure hung blue black round moon 
side rail shrubs confined garden 
house dark many tall white flowers like bright vapor rising earth clung air beds 
leaning tree miltoun gave memory 
silent boughs drooped round dark figure little sleepy bird uttered faint cheep hedgehog small beast night rustled away grass close moth flew past seeking candle flame 
something miltoun heart took wings searching warmth light blown candle love 
hush heard sound branch ceaselessly trailed long grass fainter fainter distinct fainter nothing could see make homeless sound 
sense near unseen presence crept till hair moved scalp 
god would light moon stars let see god would end expectation night let one wan glimmer garden one wan glimmer breast stayed dark homeless noise never ceased 
weird thought came miltoun made heart wandering trying feel warm 
closed eyes knew heart indeed external presence unconsoled 
stretching hands moved forward arrest sound 
reached railing ceased 
saw flame leap pale broad pathway light blanching grass 
realizing within gasped 
fingernails bent broke iron railing without knowing 
night red flowers windowsill wafted scent sheer overpowering rush passion 
profounder terrible rising within yearning love defeated would nevermore stir lie dead dark grass beneath dark boughs 
victorious stole back tree 
could see little white moths traveling path lamplight could see white flowers quite plainly pale watch blossoms guarding dark sleepy ones stood reasoning hardly longer feeling stunned battered struggle 
face hands sticky honey dew slowly invisibly distilling lime tree

suddenly came certainty presence 
yes verandah could see white figure head foot realizing could see expected utter cry

miltoun ran forward railing

suddenly found hand mouth though blood staunched escaped heart
