thought guilt forever damned soul came first moment misery 
loss escape danger still stood least hint reached mistake made filled mind entirely dwell less impersonal theme 
words muttered several short passage showed fools paradise revelling certainly turned every thought towards murder seized street proclaimed wife 
satisfaction uttered well struck gave little hint remorse gloating delight added something devil assisted make safe blow well deadly one proof used cunning planning crime pleasure apparent success 
continued frame mind never lost confidence precautions taken mystery deed surrounded apparent fact revisited van burnam office following morning hung accustomed nail keys gramercy park house 
front door closed knew gone away full belief form left lying behind midnight floor accumulated terrors situation came full force began think well longed courage approach even daring call help 
thought husband committed crime held tongue tied though soon began move inch inch direction time could far overcome terror enter room lay 
supposed still supposed natural seeing open door keys took pocket house victim member household

first match went courage light another crept away darkness listen foot stairs 
sound terrifying sense began pervade house alone 
yet safety thought opportunity planning finally stress purpose every moment developing within went softly stairs listened doors till certain house unoccupied 
came walked resolutely back parlor knew allowed time pass could never summon strength cross grisly threshold 
yet nothing hours crouch one dismal corners waiting morning 
go mad awful interval wonder 
must near 
asked miss butterworth asked light know concerning poor victim presence account darkness showing little terror entrance mr stone approach 
account way two half burned matches found parlor grate 
one flung probably used light dining room gas 
still lighted drove may alarmed sound stopping coach put vague idea hiding till knew whether old gentleman coming suspicious unreasonable husband 
lighted probably aroused sleep parlor sofa moment dazed cry resent embrace time understand succumbed cruel stab killed 
miss butterworth however thinks poor creature took intruder franklin till heard voice probably became amazed measure paralyzed found impossible move cry 
miss butterworth woman great discretion think explanation truest consider little prejudiced mrs van burnam 
return 
first glimmer light came closed shutters rose began dreadful task 
upheld purpose relentless drove author horror murder stripped body put upon clothing one exception shoes 
dressed steadied heart one wild pull dragged cabinet upon face might lose traits identification become impossible 
strength could contemplate result without shrieking imagine 
perhaps hardly human crisis perhaps something demon informed awful work entered breast making thing possible 
know said calmly 
mind judgment left give appearance 
observing dress put conspicuous plaid exchanged skirt portion brown silk petticoat observed hung course would went house till came upon pins pinned sight 
thus equipped still person attract attention especially hat put fallen head covered dead woman body nothing would induce move 
confidence powers escape question toned every nerve dreadfulness situation soon decent shape flight opened front door prepared slip 
intense dread felt husband dread actuated movements sustained harrowing task ever woman performed seized renewed force quailed prospect entering streets alone 
supposing stoop supposing opposite window even could encounter live far away felt 
murderer said help haunting scene crime see alive well might expect astonishment alarm dare go 
neither dare remain quaking good five minutes threshold made one wild dash door 
one sight reached broadway ran across man woman 
even got without one speaking favored providence found nook end alley way remained undiscovered till late enough morning enter shop buy hat 
rest movements known 
found way mrs desberger time without interruption place sought found situation miss althorpe 
fate way connected mine randolph stone engaged marry john randolph whose clutches escaped course unsuspected incredible may seem continued unsuspected long remained house 
reason 
duties could well attend room feeling horror world everything kept room much possible never went knew house 
thought love awakened intolerable emotions much admired revered miss althorpe could bring meet even talk man expectation soon united 
another thing ignorant circumstances invested much interest crime witness 
know victim recognized innocent man arrested murder 
fact knew nothing concerning affair save seen eyes one mentioned murder presence religiously avoided sight paper fear see account horrible affair lose small remnants courage still possessed 
apathy concerning matter important rather almost frenzied determination cut loose dreadful past may seem strange unnatural seem stranger yet say efforts haunted night day one small fact connected past made forgetfulness impossible 
taken rings hands dead woman taken away clothes possession valuables probably represented much money weighed conscience made feel like thief 
purse found pocket skirt put trouble rings source constant terror disturbance 
hid finally ball yarn using even experienced little peace mine lacked courage avow seek person rightfully belonged 
therefore intervals fever attacked miss althorpe house overheard enough conversation miss butterworth learn murdered woman mrs van burnam husband relatives office somewhere downtown seized instinct restitution took first opportunity offered leave bed hunt people 
would injure way secretly restoring jewels never dreamed 
indeed exercise mind subject followed instincts delirium appearance showed cunning insane person pursuit purpose fail remember found way duane street suggestion diseased brain induced slip rings upon hook attached mr van burnam desk 
probably mere utterance well known name ears passers enough obtain directions needed however may result misapprehension complications followed serious 
emotion caused unaccountable discovery connection crime need speak 
love one time felt john randolph turned gall bitterness enough sense duty remained bruised broken heart keep denouncing police till sudden stroke fate providence saw carriage miss althorpe realized man upon point allying preserve place regard attain lofty position promised union attempted murder murdered another woman less unfortunate miserable 
last bitterest blow could come hand though instinct led throw carriage stood thus escape meeting felt could never survive determined moment save miss althorpe alliance villain revenge upon never forgotten manner 
revenge involved public shame angelic goodness saved regret deeply even wish 
madness upon made blind every consideration boundless hatred bore look forgiveness account still hope day come see spite momentary disregard feelings cherish affection nothing efface make ruling passion life
