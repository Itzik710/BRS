hyder ali marched eight years ago swept whole country foot hills sea coast 
father would glad stand neutral course bound go english nabob arcot nominal sovereign went 
sympathies course people chiefs heart favor hyder

time madras governed imbeciles 
council composed entirely timid irresolute men 
clear force capable withstanding could put field whole country beyond reach guns forts madras would mercy hyder 
mercy shown elsewhere 
whole populations either massacred carried slaves 
therefore storm clearly burst almost sent secret messages hyder assure sympathies would gladly hail ruler carnatic 
father way inclined take step

one evening dick remarked said madras uncle would someday tell invasion hyder ali 
tell rajah nodded 
sons took seats feet dick curled divan side 
must know rajah began war really result intrigues sir thomas rumbold governor madras council 
first place seriously angered nizam 
latter taken french force service english compelled basult jung dismiss madras sent officer court instructions remonstrate 
time gave notice longer pay tribute agreed upon territory called northern circars 
would led war bengal government promptly interfered canceled altogether demands made madras government time patched quarrel 
nizam professed satisfied saw trouble might arise english prepared enforce demands 
therefore entered negotiations hyder ali mahrattis alliance whose object entire expulsion british india 
mahrattis poonah operate bombay central india north make incursions bengal nizam invade northern circars hyder direct force madras 
hyder began collect military stores obtained large quantities french mahe town still retain malabar coast 
madras government prepared attack mahe hyder informed settlements dutch french english malabar coast situated within territory equally entitled protection mahe attacked retaliate incursion province arcot 
spite threat mahe captured 
hyder time remained quiet madras government gave fresh cause offence sending force august assistance basult jung adoni 
get detachment pursue route led two hundred miles difficult passes territories nizam hyder 
council altogether ignored expressed determination princes oppose march even observe civility informing going send troops territory 
say dick made real difference end 
alliance three native powers made certain war would break shortly 
still folly giving hyder nizam reasonable excuse entering upon hostilities might deferred madras government better prepared meet storm 
bengal government fortunately stepped undid least part evil 
took entire management affairs hands rumbold council action confirmed board directors censured proceedings dismissed sir thomas rumbold two chief associates council suspended members 
prompt conciliatory measures taken bengal government appeased resentment felt nizam induced withdraw confederacy 
hyder however bent upon war imbecile government took steps whatever meet storm 
commissariat entirely neglected transport train whatever important posts left without garrison 
towards end june received news hyder left capital head army ninety thousand men twenty eight thousand cavalry 
attempted disguise object moved confident power conquer carnatic drive english sea 
father already made preparations 
everything readiness soon news reached started madras guard escort mother traders town landowners gathered fear trembling 
painful scene may imagine shall never forget terrified crowds streets wailing women 
many families left reached madras safety remained town dead prisoners beyond hills 
hyder descended pass changama th july horsemen spread like cloud country burning devastating slaughtering 
hyder moved main army slowly occupying town town placing garrisons 
must suppose devastated whole country 
wise 
anticipated reigning sovereign wish injure prosperity 
tracts considered devastation would hamper movements english army everything laid waste 
st august invested arcot week later hearing british army moved madras broke siege advanced meet 
sir hector munro british general doubt brave committed terrible blunder 
instead marching combine force colonel baillie coming guntoor marched opposite direction conjeveram sending word colonel baillie follow 
baillie force amounted two thousand eight hundred men munro five thousand two hundred 
united force would exceeded eight thousand could given battle hyder immense army fair hope success 
english greater odds 
father marched cavalry one hundred fifty strong munro 
course english general gave despatch carry colonel baillie 
rode hard moment hyder cavalry might swoop bar road got safely next morning th baillie started 
encampment within twenty five miles madras one long forced march could effected junction munro 
heat tremendous baillie halted night bank river cortelour 
bed dry father urged cross halting 
colonel replied men exhausted move farther would next day able join munro mattered side river encamped 
night river rose ten days unable cross 
th september got time tippoo five thousand picked infantry six thousand horse six heavy guns large body irregulars detached hyder watch us barred way 
colonel baillie finding possibility reaching conjeveram without fighting took position village th attacked tippoo 
action lasted three hours although enemy four times numerous english beat attacks 
engaged tippoo large cavalry force horsemen could nothing therefore forced remain rear british line 
though colonel baillie beaten attacks made felt strong enough fight way conjeveram fourteen miles distant therefore wrote sir hector munro come assistance 
three days sir hector nothing evening th sent force composed flank companies regiments 
managed make way past forces hyder tippoo reached us without fire shot 
arrival brought force three thousand seven hundred men 
munro made feigned attack upon hyder prevented moving reinforce tippoo could got without much difficulty 
nothing hyder seeing utter incapacity man opposed moved whole army guns join son 
force set soon dark evening th moment started harassed enemy irregulars 
march continued five six miles position becoming serious last colonel baillie took fatal resolution halting till morning instead taking advantage darkness press forward 
daybreak fifty guns opened us 
ten field pieces returned fire ammunition exhausted 
orders issued colonel completely lost head men mowed hundreds last enemy poured slaughtered relentlessly 
see end conflict 
colonel gave orders halt father said foolish officer sacrifice lives 
think three thousand men withstand one hundred thousand great number guns go 
good 
mounted horses rode 
darkness came suddenly upon body tippoo horsemen dashed straight cut way loss half force draw rein reached madras 
roar battle heard conjeveram fury indignation camp desertion colonel baillie detachment great general last gave orders march assistance 
force arrived within two miles scene conflict cessation fire showed late baillie force well nigh annihilated 
munro retired conjeveram three clock next morning retreated loss heavy guns stores madras 
campaign lasted twenty one days marked almost incredible stupidity incapacity part two english commanders 
remained madras 
father determined would take share fighting english general possessing courage ability always distinguished took command 
meantime hyder surrounded captured arcot six weeks delay laid siege amboor chingleput wandiwash 
november sir eyre coote arrived england took command 
confidence restored fine old soldier engaged every struggle india time clive whole country hands hyder impossible obtain draft animals carts middle january able move

captain davis said called english engineers company white troops ordered blow gate 
father volunteered follow close behind dismounted cavalry word given forward went 
hot work tell 
enemy guns swept road musketry kept incessant roar 
many fell kept close gate white troops opened fire upon hyder men walls cover sappers fixing powder bags 
soon ran back us 
great explosion gates fell 
loud shouts rushed forward fort close behind us came sepoys led captain davis 
took sharp fighting overcame resistance garrison fought desperately knowing well enough massacre baillie force little quarter would given 
british loss considerable twenty father little company among killed 
great stores provisions found proved useful army 
news capture carangooly alarmed besiegers wandiwash raised siege retreated following day sir eyre coote force arrived 
curious thing day month sir eyre coote twenty one years raised siege wandiwash victory army covering operation 
wandiwash nobly defended young lieutenant named flint made way enemy lines hours treacherous native officer command arranged hyder surrender taking command repulsed every attack even made sortie 
long pause 
commissariat train sir eyre coote forced make seashore though hotly followed hyder reached cuddalore 
french fleet coast however prevented provisions sent even french retired madras government dilatory forwarding supplies army reduced verge starvation 
middle june movement possible owing want carriage 
country inland swept bare hyder leaving cuddalore sir eyre coote obliged follow seacoast 
arrived porto novo army delighted find british fleet scarcely less pleased hear lord macartney arrived governor madras 
hyder army taken strong position camp cuddalore sir eyre coote determined give battle 
four days rice landed fleet scanty supply knapsacks troops marched attack hyder 
formed part baggage guard therefore excellent opportunity seeing fight 
march sea 
infantry moved order battle two lines 
going distance could see enemy position plainly 
strong one 
right high ground numerous batteries would take us flank advanced line extended heights sand hills shore 
thrown several batteries might aught knew many guns hidden high ground either flank 
hour spent reconnoitring enemy position kept incessant cannonade english field guns attempted reply 
officers troop seemed impossible force could advance attack hyder position without literally swept away crossfire would opened upon expressed fears father said see repetition terrible affair baillie column 
english got commander knows business case never fear result 
grant lookout seems desperate 
hyder advantage strong position powerful artillery six seven one point numbers firmly believe night see us possession hills hyder army full flight 
presently saw movement 
two lines infantry formed columns instead advancing towards hyder position turned towards sea marched along sand hills 
time set motion kept along infantry sea protection hyder cavalry sweep 
preparations made supposition advance main road cuddalore movement entirely disconcerted plans 
sand hills completely protected advancing columns reached point almost line hyder center artillery dashed crest hills first column passed break moved forward enemy guns clearing way 
short halt made artillery second line came also took position hill 
first column guns moved forward 
hyder meantime moved back line batteries position right angles occupied facing passage sand hills english advancing 
soon column issued valley tremendous fire poured upon formed line battle covered fire artillery moved forward 
grand sight 
father left baggage remained sea ridden sand hill view whole battleground 
astonishing see line english infantry advancing tremendous fire rising ground occupied dense masses enemy 
presently movement opposite vast body cavalry moved slope 
came red english line suddenly broke magic number small squares surrounded glistening bayonets appeared stood 
rode hyder cavalry 
every gun side turned upon 
though could see confusion ranks caused shot swept kept 
seemed little red patches must altogether overwhelmed advancing wave 
came closer flashes fire spurted faces squares 
could see horses recoil close bayonets stream poured intervals squares 
crackling volleys broke batteries sand hills incessant fire kept upon 
following volleys came incessant rattle musketry 
confusion among cavalry grew greater greater 
regiments mixed together numbers impeded action 
many gallant fellows detaching mass rode bravely squares died bayonets others huddled together confused helpless storm bullets shot last sudden impulse rode directions sweeping round regained position rear infantry loud cheers broke side 
squares fell line advancing steadily drove hyder infantry 
going strong force infantry cavalry guns moved round hyder fall british rear 
however met second line hitherto remained reserve fierce fighting driven back along sand hills 
retiring main body hyder cavalry moved round support attack 
fortunately british schooner sailed porto novo troops started anchored near shore give protection could baggage opened fire guns upon cavalry rode along sand hills sea effect halted wavered two batteries sand hills also opened fire upon fell back haste 
hyder last effort 
british line continued advance gained positions occupied enemy soon headlong flight hyder almost forced attendants leave ground 
wonderful victory 
english numbered men killed wounded 
hyder force loss less 
victory immense effect restoring confidence english troops greatly shaken misfortunes caused incapacity munro baillie 
consequences want carriage deficiency provisions equipment prevented sir eyre coote taking offensive obliged confine capturing forts near coast 
th august armies met hyder chosen scene victory baillie force give battle believing position fortunate one 
hyder joined tippoo present last battle force numbered men english strong 
see battle time occupied escorting convoy provisions madras 
fight much better contested previous battle 
hyder well acquainted ground made skilful use opportunities fortifying points could attacked 
fight lasted eight hours 
last sir eyre coote first division turned enemy left flank capture village pillalore second turned right hyder obliged fall back 
done good order enemy claimed drawn battle 
however case english night encamped position occupied hyder morning 
still scandalous mismanagement madras continued cripple us 
learning commandant vellore unless relieved would driven surrender want provisions sir eyre coote marched help 
met enemy way 
hyder taken surprise moving english arrived 
order give infantry time march away hurled whole cavalry english 
charged greatest bravery although batteries swept ranks grape squares received deadly volleys persevered tippoo carried infantry guns lost five thousand men followed 
english moved towards vellore 
hyder avoided another encounter vellore relieved 
sir eyre coote handed commandant almost whole provisions carried army thus supplied garrison sufficient food six weeks marched back madras troops suffering greatly famine way 
nothing took place winter except sir eyre coote advanced revictualled vellore 
march french fleet arrived coast landed force three thousand men assist hyder informed much larger division way 
fortunately arrive many ships captured english way 
course year several fights none consequence things remained state end year th december hyder died tippoo proclaimed successor 
bussy arrived fresh reinforcements france april took command hyder french contingent june battle force commanded general stuart successor sir eyre coote obliged resign ill health died spring 
french position strong one protected numerous field works 
battle sanguinary fought war considering numbers engaged 
english carried portion works captured fourteen guns french retired night able claim victory 
loss however thousand french third number 
year little fighting 
bombay force however command general matthews captured bednore tippoo hastened great force besieged bednore forced surrender desperate defense 
tippoo violated terms capitulation made defenders prisoners 
bangalore next besieged resisted nearly nine months surrendered january 
tippoo time lost services french auxiliaries england france made peace home 
negotiations tippoo english went till march treaty signed 
provisions tippoo handed back prisoners 
murdered large numbers british soldiers sepoys obtained liberty 
one knows many retained number calculated natives carried countries overrun hyder troops 
released 
british would doubtless freed scandalous cowardice three men sent british commissioners tippoo 
treated greatest insult contempt fear lives glad accept prisoners chose hand without troubling slightest rest basely deserted left fate 
chapter war declared 
gives general idea dick war tippoo 
saw little events battle porto novo father taken ill soon died madras 
seeing probability whatever english driving hyder back much larger forces much better system management remained madras peace made came back rebuilt palace since occupied trying restore prosperity poor people 
feel useless task certain ere long english engaged mysore well nigh certain tippoo hordes sweep hills carry ruin desolation everywhere 
would hyder advantage side beginning war 
score passes choose descend plain one may select 
even force capable giving battle whole mysorean army could watch passes army would broken dozen commands 
tippoo therefore able ravage plains weeks perhaps english force give battle 
army present existence sufficient strength meet 
madras force would wait reinforcements arrived calcutta 
bad worse 
hyder doubt slaughtered many cruel nature 
carried enormous quantities people flocks herds enrich mysore labor treat unnecessary cruelty 
tippoo hand human tiger 
delights torturing victims slays prisoners pure love bloodshed 
proud title tiger 
footstool tiger head uniforms infantry sort imitation tiger stripes 
military talent showed great judgment command division indeed successes gained last war work 
since labored incessantly improve army 
numbers regiments raised composed captives carried west coast 
drilled european fashion english captives still holds hands 
uncle instead giving time tippoo come march passes compel keep army defend seringapatam dick first place army strong enough even force fifty thousand men madras could take offensive time 
english army move without great train carry ammunition stores provisions get train together would work months 
telling three years last war lasted madras authorities never able collect train consequence army unable go two three days march city 
hand tippoo could day order three days supply rice grain served soldier could set march following morning moment reached plains cavalry would whole resources country mercy 
see uncle 
war broke would go madras would nothing else dick 
send everything value soon saw war inevitable 
traders already begun prepare 
shops half empty replaced goods sold hours would suffice everything worth taking cleared town 
country round comparatively uninhabited small portion tilled great number carried hyder 
next time take hills believe many already stored grain hiding places 
time may hoped weeks months may see tippoo driven back time peasants manage exist hills 
doubt richer sort large flocks goats many cattle soon danger threatens drive madras sure fetch good prices use army 
already told men bullock carts teams forced leave home earn good living taking service english transport train 
hope therefore results disastrous 
town may burnt unless blow palace little harm 
rebuilt seeing possibility another war would wood whatever used construction 
therefore hangings taken furniture rooms cleared nothing burn likely waste powder blowing 
town warned people returned might destroyed long therefore solid building 
houses lightly run wood plentiful enough hills great harm therefore done burnt 
pagoda palace stone buildings 
harm former last time firing shot day two see attempt since made repair suppose trouble damage 
see dick prepared worst 
fight last time uncle know dick 
show loyalty english rule repairing capital force small render much service 
see revenues greatly diminished afford keep large force father could 
fortunately savings considerable able build palace succor people still enough keep establishment without pressing cultivators soil taxes 
year first drawn revenue source rate disposed keep force would insufficient great value war like would heavy tax purse 
even force must uncle 
much would think dick english notions 
pay small small would seem impossible man live yet many men wives families 
patches land cultivate twenty changed month kept duty 
necessary little respect people less still rajahs sentries gates guard ready turn honor visitor might arrive say nothing escort half dozen men ride country 
course called whenever want example rode madras meet 
men think well upon pay three rupees month practically duty two months year rest time cultivate fields 
therefore pay officers troop costs four hundred rupees month know equivalent forty english pounds call expensive army even kept show rather use 
indeed uncle seems ridiculous troop hundred men kept five hundred pounds year 
course men little privileges dick 
pay rent taxes lands 
great thing really costs nothing much land lying uncultivated 
old service pension two rupees month life little land cultivate comparatively comfortable 
well seem uncle soldiering good trade country 
know good trade money way anywhere 
pay quite high comparison ordinary rate earning peasant england 
never pay tempts soldiers 
among young men always great numbers prefer life peasant working steadily daylight dark know altogether blame 
think uncle doubt whatever war shadow doubt dick indeed may said begun already like last largely due incapacity government madras 
received message arcot rajah said two months later must go see nabob 
thought mrs holland said tripataly longer subject 
understood father made independent arcot margaret exactly 
nabob involved heavy debts great struggle 
company done something help unable take debts shoulders indeed reason done although war ally fighting behalf 
war hyder different 
quite english influence indeed could scarcely termed independent 
suffered terribly lands wasted towns besieged people driven slavery company present engaged negotiations assisting pay debts heavy 
left nabob much pressed money time claim company father bought perpetual commutation tribute taxes monies subsidies payable tripataly thus longer tributary arcot 
nevertheless forms portion nabob territories act independent prince 
could make treaty mysore account clear neither arcot english could allow case mysore could erect fortresses could use tripataly advanced post plain 
therefore still subject nabob could called upon military service 
indeed one reasons even could afford care keep force strength 
troop small worth summoning 
nabob remonstrated since war hyder good excuse namely population decreased lands lie untilled would impossible raise larger force 
however agreed case fresh war raise additional hundred cavalry 
expect relation sent arcot 
know english bound treaty travancore declare war 
ought honor done long ago unprepared 
nearly ready may time indeed nabob may learned fighting begun 
lookout bad 
government madras weak short sighted hyder war 
one comfort lord cornwallis calcutta far greater power predecessors experienced soldier said energetic man may bring reinforcements calcutta without loss time also set troops bombay motion 
expect things go badly first hope time shall end giving mysore heavy lesson powerless mischief future 
release captives mrs holland exclaimed clasping hands 
sincerely trust margaret brother said gravely happened last time must sanguine 
scattered may scores little hill forts dot whole country unhappily never sure delivered word treacherous tyrant like tippoo 
know last time kept back hundreds prisoners among may hope husband may however completely may defeated may yet retain knowing full well impossible hill forts dungeons searched 
however doubtless english army marches seringapatam many recovered though reason fear many murdered arrival 
rajah returned arcot following day brought back news general meadows moved frontier caroor fifty miles beyond trichinopoly war really begin 
know said matters stand 
tippoo making peace nizam mahrattis engaged hostilities time turned attention western coast coorg malabar risen rebellion 
usual perpetrating horrible atrocities sending large proportion population slaves mysore marched travancore 
travancore specially mentioned treaty mangalore one allies english tippoo bound make war prepared fight english would attacked ally 
excuse attacking travancore fugitives coorg malabar taken refuge 
seeing tippoo bent upon hostilities lord cornwallis council calcutta directed learned official madras authorities begin make preparations war 
instead mr holland governor gave rajah shameful cowardly advice withdraw protection fugitives 
rajah refused comply counsel months spent negotiations tippoo attacked wall runs along northern frontier travancore 
six months ago 
yes th december six months 
troops fourteen thousand strong made way without difficulty breach suddenly attacked small body travancore men 
panic seized 
rushed back breach wild struggle pass less two thousand either killed crushed death 
nearly three months tippoo renewed attack 
lines weak army strong resistance impossible 
breach three quarters mile length made wall marching devastated travancore end end 
unaccountable delay assaulting position great advantage us 
attacked us instead wasting time travancore would found carnatic defenceless completely mercy hyder 
would still done depended upon madras authorities nothing lord cornwallis took matter hands 
come general meadows formerly governor bombay arrived invested company offices governor commander chief 
landed late february set work prepare war 
lord cornwallis sent calcutta large amount money stores ammunition battalion artillerymen 
sepoys objected travel sea caste rules forbade therefore sent six battalions infantry land nabob tells expected arrive four five weeks time 
nabob arcot rajah tanjore heavily debt government ordered continuance war place revenues disposal liberal allowance made personal expenses 
tippoo still travancore least ten days ago endeavoring negotiate 
nabob tells believes object general meadows advancing trichinopoly caroor push coimbatoor arrives tippoo cut return capital meadows force fifteen thousand men ought able crush tyrant blow 
fear however little chance 
mysore troops move great rapidity soon tippoo hears english army marching towards caroor sure take alarm time probably passed coimbatoor way back 
faults tippoo good general nabob opinion quite agree soon regains table land mysore take advantage english army far away south pour passes part carnatic present absolutely defenceless 
case shall get ready leave madras shall move soon learn certain tippoo slipped past english 
nabob called upon join little body cavalry soon news comes tippoo descending passes shall either join english army 
matter decide afterwards 
take course uncle dick asked eagerly 
certainly dick 
old enough undertake really perilous adventure going disguise mysore certainly old enough ride 
besides may hope time war going one sided last time may end reaching seringapatam case may rescue father still alive much easily could managed way propose 
news english army marched caroor force left prevent mysoreans pouring hills spread quickly dick went two boys town groups people talking earnestly streets 
came asked respectfully later news 
nothing later heard dick said 
rajah going away yet sahib leave unless hears tippoo returned army seringapatam 
go sultan might come passes moment get fortnight english army return caroor 
yes use waiting eaten sahib 
think conjeveram would safe easy go boat 
think 
hyder could take last time english army much stronger 
besides six thousand men arriving bengal month time think fear conjeveram taken 
little trouble getting trader said long journey madras 
could go families goods two days boat would boats enough best therefore go wait news tippoo coming many able get away time 
boats dick agreed three days bullock cart would get 
next day several shops containing valuable goods shut day day number remaining open grew smaller 
expected rajah said one morning came room family sitting 
messenger come nabob news sickness broke among army soon arrived caroor twenty four hours thousand men hospital

already arranged people gone bullock carts belongings unload readiness take goods madras delay getting forward 
nightfall apartments completely dismantled 
furniture stowed away vault rajah constructed purpose palace rebuilt 
access obtained floor one private apartments 
floor tessellated marble ten squares lifted mass forming together trapdoor steps led vault

palace astir long daybreak

sun rising started 
one boat fitted bower green boughs use two ladies four attendants 
two carried baggage 
seeing push rajah sons dick returned palace 
couple hours held sort audience gave advice townspeople others came considerable numbers consult 
done went courtyard ready departure 
troop past week raised two hundred men many young cultivators coming eagerly forward soon heard rajah going increase troop anxious take share adventures might looked avenge sufferings inflicted friends hyder marauders 
somewhat motley troop mattered little uniformity unknown among forces native princes 
majority stout young fellows 
provided horses arms although former lacked weight bone english cavalry horses capable performing long journeys existing rations english horse would starve 
well armed deficiency made rajah store large number guns three days distributed among ryots intended take hills approach enemy 
ammunition also distributed among 
every man troop carried shield tulwar back slung musket spear without pistols girdles 
rode halfway conjeveram stopped night village men sleeping open air rajah sons dick entertained chief man place 
next afternoon rode conjeveram sunset boats also arrived 
troop encamped outside town rajah party occupied rooms secured beforehand 
morning ladies proceeded native carriage troop officer ten men following charge bullock carts containing baggage 
reaching madras encamped maidan large open space used drill ground troops garrisoned rajah party established house occupied occasion last visit 
next day rajah went government house interview deputy governor 
think latter said conversation troop cavalry little use nabob 
tippoo comes hills able take field need forces defend arcot vellore smaller forts cavalry would real use 
troop would much greater utility battalions bengal arrive 
three weeks soon come attach 
write nabob saying join interest general defense thought better present attach bengal contingent 
see entirely new country great advantage troop like many well acquainted roads general geography country 
speaking english add usefulness 
nephew speaks english perfectly also hindustani rajah said 
smart young fellow doubt officer command would able make useful 
eager service 
father englishman wrecked years ago west coast sent prisoner mysore 
one handed time peace whether murdered still prisoner tippoo hands know 
sister came boy three four months ago endeavor obtain news 
make note rajah 
doubt great use colonel cockerell 
last week july rajah moved troop conjeveram st august bengal forces arrived 
joined three regiments europeans one native cavalry strong force artillery raising numbers nine thousand five hundred men 
colonel kelly took command force begged rajah advance horsemen foot ghauts break half troops capture destroy small parties horse tippoo might send passes reconnoitre country ascertain movements strength british forces 
also endeavor obtain much information could going mysore ascertain whether tippoo still army watching general meadows west moving intention taking advantage main force english away south descend carnatic 
order acceptable one rajah 
troop made good appearance enough company nabob arcot could feel looked motley body side trained native european troops frequently angered hearing jeering comments english soldiers rode past troop little astonished speakers turning round horse abusing hotly language 
therefore glad 
work men far better fitted even native cavalry company service 
stout active fellows accustomed hills speaking dialect used shepherds villagers among ghauts 
proceeding northward vellore divided force four bodies 
fifty men took position mouth pass amboor 
another fifty sent pass moognee west chittoor command anwar captain troop 
rest distributed among minor passes 
dick remained uncle established village seven miles pass 
well satisfied arrangement anxious learn go among hills spy much likely get leave uncle would officers troop would ventured allow rajah nephew run danger 
second place especial friend among officers youth named surajah son rajbullub detachment 
surajah especially picked rajah dick companion 
generally joined rides often gone shooting excursions among hills 
three years dick senior point height little difference 
every day half troop officer rode pass within mile fort near summit garrisoned mysorean troops 
able obtain little information villages towards upper end pass deserted ruins inhabitants never ventured back since hyder invasion 
rajah vexed able learn nothing passing plateau therefore disposed might otherwise listen dick proposal 
think uncle latter said one evening might try learn something going surajah alone could strike hills shooting expedition used tripataly except stain face hands 
people villages top ghauts every one says simple quiet 
love tippoo mysore content pay taxes work quietly fields 
little fear interfered 
might find party tippoo troops one villages dick get trouble 
see uncle 
course go dressed shikarees went village begin asking whether people troubled tigers neighborhood 
see specially came go mysore disguise getting little practice way besides obtaining news 
certainly anxious get news dick 
far nothing send except reports passes agree saying learned nothing movement part tippoo spies come passes armed party whatever 
good far goes shows passes like entirely deserted 
therefore really know nothing whatever 
even moment tippoo may fifty thousand men gathered crest hills ready pour tomorrow one passes therefore think would running great danger consent going surajah scouting expedition foot among hills 
say must course disguise peasants 
better addition guns take brace pistols armed even villagers inclined hostile would care interfering 
thank uncle 
would expect us back start tomorrow morning must entirely hands dick 
would hardly climb ghauts light upon village one day might necessary go farther could obtain news 
broken country much jungle distance beyond hills villages lying roads little communication might know nothing whatever happening cultivated plains beyond 
rate must go villages roads leading heads passes forts everywhere would certain find parties troops stationed 
even war broke know case stationed prevent captives native european escaping mysore 
must therefore strictly avoid main roads even though may necessary proceed much farther get news 
think say three days going many returning little count upon shall begin feel uneasy reappear week 
use returning without information going mysore would folly throw away work trouble another day two might get news want 
shall therefore leave entirely discretion 
greatly pleased succeeded beyond expectations dick sought surajah 
latter gratified heard accompany young sahib expedition set necessary preparations 
difficulty obtaining village clothes required disguises one sheep intended following day rations killed leg boiled 
take addition ten pounds flour gourd ghee little pan frying cakes shall able get without buy food four five days course among villages shall difficulty getting 
better cut meat bone divide two portions divide flour carry share 
willingly carry sahib 
surajah 
take fair share 
see shall gun pistols ammunition tulwar seven eight pounds food water bottles quite enough carry ghauts 
thing want stain 
get something bring morning sahib 
take minute put 
come first gleam daylight 
dick returned cottage occupied uncle told preparations made journey sat talking details another hour 
rajah last words lay night forget take blanket 
want sleeping open probably several times although may occasionally able find shelter village 
time sun rose next morning well upon way 
good deal toilsome climbing nightfall surmounted difficult portions ascent encamped became dark small wood 
lighted fire cooked cakes flour cold meat made hearty meal 
day halted twice breakfasted lunched bread brought sufficient day journey 
suppose occasion watch surajah know sahib 
think safe us sleep 
know many tigers among hills though would approach us long fire burning brightly might steal carry one us fire gets low 
therefore watch 
certainly let without taking turn dick said feel tired day work think could keep awake ten minutes 
would better sleep tree 
would get much sleep tree sahib 
done twice hunting tiger infested neighborhood got scarcely sleep stiff morning could hardly walk 
would rather sit night keep good fire 
dick thought minute two got walked trees keeping eyes fixed upon branches overhead 
said last 
come surajah 
see two branches coming direction one point five six feet apart 
might fasten blankets side side help straps water bottles slings guns make called board ship hammocks lie perfectly safe comfortable 
surajah nodded 
coil leather thong sahib 
thought might useful wanted bind prisoner purpose stuffed waist sash 
good 
let us lose time quite ready sleep 
climb first 
ten minutes blankets securely fastened side side branches 
surajah descended threw another armful wood fire placed meat crutch bough six feet ground climbed tree 
thus soon lying side side blankets 
bagged rather inconveniently weight tired mind trifles soon fast asleep 
dick wake surajah called 
already broad daylight 
companion slipped quietly stirred embers fire thrown wood cooked chupatties waking 
bad surajah dick said looked ought woke 
unfasten blankets get 
save time breakfast 
half hour later way shortly came upon boy herding goats 
looked doubtfully seeing mysorean soldiers attempt fly 
far next village lad surajah asked way shikarees 
tigers plenty boy said 
drive goats strong high stockade every evening would come sun rose money say sultan 
make tree close see spring 
follow 
take village 
walking six hours came village 
place little size people 
women came doors look surajah dick came along 
old man asked came cottage 
mountain side 
tigers getting scarce thought would come see could 
many tigers old man said 
last twenty years wars taken young men away 
forced go order comes head man village sultan requires many soldiers forced pick best fitted service 
others go free thinking soldiering easier work tilling fields besides chance getting rich booty 
shikarees tigers multiply curse us 
poor people choose stay time pay something every tiger kill send round villages within ten miles doubtless every one contribute might get enough pay exertions 
think surajah replied 
intend stop one village proposed travel jungle covered district wherever hear complaints tiger committing depredations stop best kill evil beast 
mean first find troublesome shall work back 
hear sultan gives good prices taken alive 
heard old man said none caught alive anyone villages round 
sultan generally gets royal forests none allowed shoot save permission 
sometimes lack hunters come districts catch pitfalls nets ropes tigers bound taken away 
little crowd time collected round women heard strangers shikarees come intention killing tigers brought bowls milk cakes presents 
suppose sultan away war dick said hunters come tigers know nothing wars woman said 
take sons us see 
hear report gone army conquer travancore 
want none us make 
dominions wide heart man require 
strange rest contented like father always taking sons away fight 
however things beyond understanding poor people like us help thinking would better send armies destroy tigers 
would grudge sums pay tax gatherers come round 
pausing hour village continued way 
two three small collections huts passed evening next day issued jungle covered country onto cultivated plain 
none places passed anything known tippoo army told parties troops villages along edge plain well passes 
must careful surajah dick said long day march sat rest distance half mile large village 
tale shikarees 
really object stopped first place came rate come beyond jungle 
might still say shikarees tigers become scarce side hills hearing talk tippoo english going war made minds go seringapatam enlist army 
would well surajah agreed 
would reason doubting us even officer suggest enlist could would difficulty slipping away making jungle 
waited sun set walked village 
scarcely entered two armed men stopped questioned whence came 
surajah repeated story agreed upon men appeared quite satisfied 
time one said 
news sultan moved army seringapatam 
officers came yesterday buy cattle grain 
retained orders received sent say coming way going passes hyder

purchased went little farther laid fresh supply flour 
things dear surajah remarked

pounded wife women since morning 
good enough dick said walked away 
work done surajah likely learn anything stop week 
let us turn houses make way round behind 
might questioned fresh party soldiers go along street 
kept along outskirts village regained road come walked reached edge jungle 
going short distance among trees collected sticks lit fire sat cook meal 
last village two heard little tigers agreed could safely lie would necessary rig blankets hammocks done first two nights 
chapter perilous adventure 
retraced steps without adventure reached village first stopped 
soldiers surajah exclaimed entered 
help dick said 
nothing go boldly 
suppose tippoo sent troops frontier villages prevent chance news movements taken plains 
ah old chap spoke us last time 
let us stop talk 
back peasant said came

nice thing none us ever seringapatam know got 
moreover would saying whether one would ever come back 
terrible 
besides grain enough shall send plains buy money come nobody tell 
think could tell better proceed take us house surajah said 
place talking 
four five soldiers watching us 
old man entered house closed door behind 
would counsel us proceed asked soon seated divan formed low bank beaten earth thick covering straw 
simple enough surajah said 
one would take order sultan treasury large village plain 
would go trader say wished purchase much grain goods would pay order sultan treasury 
would probably accepted readily cash trader would send merchant banker seringapatam get cashed pay goods obtained either send balance might retain purchases 
order kind better money trading purposes would fear stolen way could hidden hair shoe anywhere among clothes messenger 
wonderful old peasant said 
words relief indeed village hear 
dick broke let us talk tigers 
speaking soldiers passed door twice looking suspiciously house 
take heads come ask business would tell discussing value orders sultan treasury 
advice assistance matter turn render us aid business killing tigers 
want find us tiger last seen near village lair supposed whether according situation best chance killing digging pitfall path usually comes jungle getting kid tying attract tiger spot shall stationed tree

soon old man left seated large faggot wood brought villagers fuel 
stay surajah 
important get back news doubt pig headed brute says hold us prisoners tippoo gone passes

think fellow really suspects us simply keeping us show authority 
ought difficulty getting 
suppose shall put one soldiers huts tonight crawl asleep make way narrow steps top wall let side 
fifteen feet high even dropped likely hurt 
likely sentry gate surajah observed moon tonight 
ought difficulty pouncing suddenly gagging give alarm tying 
walk round see rope lying 
tear sash strips 
use lower wall 
like get weapons could 
guns matter pistols good ones 
alarm given may fight 
besides impossible may come across tiger go along 
vote secured sentry pay officer visit 
surajah nodded 
quite ready agree anything dick might suggest felt strong desire repossess arms seemed would humiliation go back without 
course dick went sentry gives alarm secure must give part plan case bolt 
wall right 
may fire away us run fear hitting us half asleep quite sure 
get fair start need much fear catching us 
long straight running sahib follow us far may come within range us making way nasty places came face ghaut 
get well away hide somewhere strike another line 
might surajah agreed know place came one seemed us climbable would certainly better make find way 
quite agree surajah 
would never go find edge precipice could get soldiers anywhere near us 
besides greatest importance take news back soon possible every hour may importance 
wish could find pass tippoo means go suppose known starts 
anyhow news valuable present supposed side would taken troops entirely surprise suddenly poured onto plain 
must give idea hiding lie day would mean loss twenty four hours would go ghauts money except daylight 
different thing going downhill going attempt dark break necks certainty 
get away early tonight shall edge steep place nine clock morning strike right point might back rajah nightfall 
difficult find way back dark surajah said 
doubt 
still keep general direction even hit upon stream tonight shall find morning 
late afternoon reached village growing dark 
two soldiers came bade follow one huts pointed farther corner place 
wrapped blankets lay 
take heads dick whispered surajah put sentry guard door upset plans 
would difficult cut way mud wall behind us first place taken away knives even would risky work trying 
chances sit talk night 
course might surprise sentry would great risk fellows close hand run straight steps might get dozen balls us wall 
think would much chance hitting us surajah said 
jumping sleep confusion would minute could find happened foot steps saw us would fire almost random 
case lose weapons added regretfully 
help 
arms consequence compared getting away unless course happen overtake us 
three four hours soldiers ten hut sat eating talking smoking round fire kept burning earthen floor 
one one however left lay 
three remained one got grumble discontent took musket leaning wall went hut 
nuisance dick whispered 
evidently going sentry duty 
perhaps gone gate surajah suggested 
afraid 
expect hut furnishing sentry 
listen pauses low conversation two men still sitting fire could hear footfall outside 
settles question dick said 
sooner fellows go sleep better 
better wait time surajah replied 
one two men lay first sure get go door look 
always twice night 
sentry soon get accustomed door opened look round sharp 
good idea dick agreed 
moon back hut shall shadow 
spring upon try grip throat holloa 
wrench musket hands snatch belt cartridges 
give us weapon anyhow 
soon got give one sharp squeeze throw 
time gets breath enough holloa 
half hour two men fire lay 
long surajah predicted one sleepers sat stretched rose walked door opened stood entrance moment later joined another figure minutes stood talking together 
came shut door lay 
next hour three others followed example last leaving door ajar behind came 
chance surajah 
must give ten minutes fall asleep 
move 
one lying awake notice us likely dark see figures distinctly ask going say door get cool 
imagine thinking escape one sentry door another gate 
think sahib would safer kill sentries safer surajah 
present done us harm 
acting officer ordered grudge

one thing enter village ask questions make purchase two different thing among people weeks perhaps months live one 
however may hope war end army marching seringapatam shall recover many prisoners tippoo hands 
say 
know many hundreds remained power last time spite promise deliver maybe something sort occur next time

chapter news captive 
nine months elapsed since retreat seringapatam dick occupied following main object presence mysore 
finding purseram bhow army first would engaged active service asked permission general join 
granted lord cornwallis introduced officer command bombay troops attached army informing object view 
much use interpreter said country going operate formed lately part mahratta dominions mahratti principally spoken 
therefore go simply officer staff attached present command 
asked allow take twenty men belonging troop uncle rajah tripataly 
object able traverse country independently either rejoin go one columns operating hill forts seem expedient 
desire make reconnaissance time find useful escort obliged ask purseram bhow party cavalry 
dick sorry leave uncle whose tent shared last ten months 
found however comfortable bombay troops made member mess consisting officer command four officers staff 
wishing duties occupy volunteered act aide de camp although work little nominal gave employment 
otherwise engaged generally rode surajah uncle appointed command twenty troopers 
year elapsed since arrival india dick grown considerably broadened greatly powerful young fellow seventeen 
since troop joined army lord cornwallis exchanged civilian dress undress uniform officer purchased sale effects young lieutenant general staff died army arrived bangalore 
indeed necessary riding either staff general officers quartermasters department 
would difficulty renewing uniform hardship fever war carried large number officers well men effects always sold auction day following funeral 
many hill fortresses captured mahrattis offered resistance commanders knew well chance relieved men cases delighted prospect escape enforced service freedom return homes 
forts english captives found 
years existence apparently forgotten tyrant 
fairly treated mysore governor case latter furnished british officers papers testifying kindness treated prisoners recommending officers allied forces might encounter way home established 
upon hand prisoners found starved treated great brutality 
two cases captives said companions died effects ill treatment received governors tried court martial shot others sentenced severely flogged 
every captive released closely scrutinised dick eagerly questioned 
one obtained news father certainly alive four years previously prison together hill fort near bangalore 
civilian sailor said consequently neither us use drilling tippoo battalions sent 
father well 
governor good fellow nothing much complain 
mr holland favorite sailor handy sorts things 
could mend piece broken furniture repair lock musket make generally useful 
left governor transferred fort never heard took father 
know whether tippoo orders whether took simply liked 
rate prisoner went 
rest us remained till months back fort abandoned 
capture bangalore place could offered resistance body troops sent 
rate order arrived one morning hours afterwards place entirely abandoned garrison marched 
father quite well quite well 
used talk times trying make escape 
sailor doubt could got precipice fort stood knew suffer probably put death soon tippoo heard one us escaped always done order deter prisoners trying get away 
think chance still alive possibly say 
see known much passing outside prison 
guards good natured enough would occasionally give us scrap news heard ill tempered ones delighted telling us anything knew would pain us 
three four months ago heard every white prisoner seringapatam put death tippoo orders doubtless would similar clearance everywhere else 
told english retreated beaten seringapatam last would soon ghauts 
whether prisoners killed hill forts like say although suppose escaped 
certainly orders sent forts found prisoners several 
course may otherwise forts near capital tippoo might thought likely fall hands may considered worth send orders places far away british force likely come 
still rate great satisfaction father alive four years ago kind hands 
favor finding still alive one places shall take lord cornwallis intends besiege fortresses command passes undertake another siege seringapatam obtain supplies freely regularly beyond ghauts nothing whatever obtained country round completely wasted tippoo cavalry 
therefore great hopes father may found one forts 
hope indeed may find 
convinced governor would save life could though hand would sure carry order might receive tippoo 
course may charge fort may appointed colonel one regiments 
however always better hope things come wish however unlikely may seem 
living hope though chances ever released small indeed 
course even know tippoo english war heard english army besieging bangalore even felt even tippoo beaten forced make peace would make difference us 
kept back hundreds prisoners defeated would certainly surrender holds unless compelled one would able give information existence captives distant forts 
yet teeth improbabilities continued hope hopes realized 
capture forts mahratta army abruptly checked 
far met slight opposition purseram bhow became confident scattered force wide extent country order might easily find food forage 
condition suddenly attacked tippoo took advantage english detained bangalore transport train reorganised strike blow mahrattis 
stroke heavy one 
many detached parties completely destroyed mahratta general gathering rest standard forced retreat strong reinforcements sent bangalore 
learning probable lord cornwallis would advance soon rejoined dick determined go back bangalore unlikely severe check received mahrattis would resume offensive time 
surajah men glad return troop soon mysorean force returned seringapatam dick without waiting infantry get motion rode rapidly across country little party 
accompanied english army operations obtaining permission go columns engaged siege hill fortresses present capture important strongholds 
bitter disappointment english prisoners found certain might massacred tippoo orders first advance british seringapatam 
great indeed satisfaction army last came sight city

within shelter formidable obstacle tippoo army encamped 
within enclosed space seven eight eminences strong redoubts erected 
fearing tippoo might soon saw position taken assailants sally army take field cut communications lord cornwallis determined strike blow

tippoo made several determined efforts drive colonel stuart force island recapture redoubts repulsed heavy loss abandoned attempt altogether evacuated redoubts brought whole army across island 
tippoo attempted negotiate 
already done month lord cornwallis refused accept advances saying negotiation useless one disregarded treaties violated articles capitulation 
send hither wrote garrison coimbatoor listen say 
lord cornwallis alluded small body troops lieutenants chalmers nash bravely defended town attacked one tippoo generals 
gallant little garrison surrendered last condition allowed march freely away 
condition violated tippoo garrison marched prisoners seringapatam 
two officers kept fort soldiers twenty seven european captives lately brought hill forts lodged village colonel knox first occupied crossing river released 
tippoo hands many years joy unexpected release unspeakable 
preparations made siege 
general abercrombie ordered force six thousand men arrival lieutenant chalmers sent letter tippoo asking terms capitulation 
negotiations indeed entered doubting tippoo good faith preparations siege continued upon arrival general abercrombie force th february siege operations commenced end island still british possession 
days afterwards army astounded hearing conditions agreed upon hostilities cease 
great indignation indeed spirit insubordination almost mutiny evinced many corps 
suffered extreme hardships engaged arduous marches decimated fever bad food could scarce believe ears heard hold hands year campaigning seringapatam mercy man butchered many hundred english captives wasted whole provinces carried half million people captivity guilty grossest treachery whose word absolutely worthless escape personal punishment 
still higher indignation rise among officers men conditions treaty became known discovered stipulation whatever made handing english prisoners still mysore previous cessation hostilities 
condition least insisted upon carried previous negotiations entered upon 
reasons induced lord cornwallis make treaty seringapatam lay mercy ever mystery 
tippoo proved monster unfitted live much less rule crimes committed english punished public trial execution author 
conclude peace enable make fresh preparations war necessitate another expedition enormous cost great loss life 
tippoo already proved bound either treaties oaths 
lastly would thought general lord cornwallis would wished name go posterity connection conquest mysore capture seringapatam rather memorable surrender york town greatest disaster ever befell british army 
conditions onerous imposed upon brutal faithless tyrant might deemed sufficient 
tippoo deprived half dominions divided among allies taking portions adjacent territory 
sum pounds paid expenses war 
prisoners allied powers restored 
two tippoo sons given hostages 
even handed considerable delays tippoo signature obtained lord cornwallis threatened resume hostilities th march treaty finally sealed 
ceded territory mahrattis nizam took third share although assistance rendered struggle comparatively slight utility 
may indeed almost said given reward accepting offers tippoo made joining british 
british share included large part malabar coast forts calicut cananore territory ally rajah coorg 
cessions gave us passes leading mysore west 
south gained possession fort dindegul districts surrounding east acquired tract amboor caroor obtained possession several important fortresses together chief passes hyder made incursions carnatic 
dick felt deeply absence proviso treaty prisoners restored previous cessation hostilities time admitting argument uncle although agreement prisoners might released means insuring stipulation would faithfully carried 
see dick one knows indeed faintest idea prisoners tippoo still hands 
know many murdered years tippoo reigned 
men escaped time time brought news murders places confined known little happened elsewhere 
moreover learned certainly fifty sixty put death seringapatam advanced upon first time 
know murdered hill forts captured 
many remain alive present time slightest idea 
tippoo might hand dozen take solemn oath one remaining though might feel perfectly certain lying position prove 
stipulation ought made matter honor would real efficiency 
course dethroned tippoo annexed territory undoubtedly got prisoners wherever hidden 
could hardly done 
would aroused jealousy fear every native prince india 
would united nizam mahrattis us would even disapproved england public opinion adverse acquisitions territory people course altogether ignorant monstrous cruelties perpetrated tippoo upon english captives upon neighbors everywhere 
naturally prejudiced favor treaty handing country amboor caroor passes forts set us free tripataly danger overrun devastated mysore 
people able go work peacefully security free alike fear wholesale invasion incursions robber bands ghauts 
waste lands taken 
revenue trebled 
another thing 
english possess territory beyond nabob arcot gradually spreading power north little doubt long whole country arcot travancore tanjore small native powers incorporated dominions 
arcot powerless defense last two wars nominally ally english nabob able give real assistance whatever burden territory fallen 
took first step beginning present war arranged utilise resources collect revenues possessions allow annual income maintenance state family 
clearly first step towards taking territory hands managing revenues done cases 
lord cornwallis day thanking services troop rendered promised early arrangement made rule tripataly government madras instead nabob 
see virtually step rank shall hold land direct english instead prince become fact puppet hands 
days later army set march mysore day rajah making adieus lord cornwallis started troop tripataly making way long marches instead following slow progress army 
couple days tripataly went madras brought back rajah household 
meeting dick mother one mixed feeling 
twenty months since former left uncle nearly eighteen 
written whenever opportunity sending letters although position interpreter staff general relieved great anxiety account glad indeed see 
upon hand fact war went fortress fortress captured news came hopes realized war come termination without mystery hung husband way cleared profoundly depressed mrs holland mingled tears pleasure sorrow fell neck return madras 
must give way mother dick said sobbed fears hope end 
remember never doubted alive always said would know evil fate befallen always felt confident right 
nothing changed 
certainly succeeded finding found many prisoners little way forts 
captives quite long therefore reason whatever also alive 
thought giving search hopeless 
mean carry old plans certainly much better fitted first landed 
know great deal mysore although say speak dialect like native learned good deal speak quite well natives ghauts outlying provinces 
surajah great friend mine told go go tremendous help 
anyhow long continue believe firmly father still alive mean continue search 
believe alive dick firmly ever 
lost hope respect 
doubt whether ever found 
well business mother 
long continue believe still alive shall continue search 
object life present 
quite soon enough think taking commission promised tell feeling alive shaken 
mrs holland comforted dick assurance confident tone putting thought aside time gave pleasure return 
found everything tripataly left mysore horsemen penetrated far north tippoo turned course east pondicherry 
people months returned homes avocations 
one evening rajah said sitting together hear wife dick mother told still intend carry original project 
yes uncle 
quite made mind 
still plenty places may certainly good deal fitted traveling disguise mysore 
rajah nodded 
yes 
think dick capable taking care anyone could 
hear surajah willing go certainly great advantage 
proved thoroughly intelligent trustworthy promised someday shall captain troop 
thinking starting yet suppose uncle 
thought staying another month two go 
mother says let go 
fancy take longer dick pass native 
dick looked surprised 
uncle pass native eighteen months ago 
yes dick long went shops bought things chatted short time natives like living among 
would found single day company native 
dick looked still surprised 
uncle would know 
dick 
sit heels squat call 
habitual attitude every native 
squats cooks 
squats hours fire smoking talking 
never stands length time except upon divan something sort never sits 
go live among natives pass one length time must learn squat hours stretch tell means easy accomplishment learn 
quite lost power 
used able boy always sitting divans chairs european fashion got way think could squat quarter hour save life 
dick mother cousins laughed heartily said seriously quite right uncle 
wonder never thought 
stupid 
course talking surajah officers camp fire sat ground see would never native dress 
begin 
wait moment dick rajah said 
things practice 
may move several disguises must learn comport accordance 
must remember motions quicker energetic people 
walk different swing arms carriage different 
unaccustomed walk either barefooted native shoes 
things practiced really pass muster 
therefore propose shall accustom attire apartments evening 
ranee boys able correct first awkwardness teach much 
week two must stain face arms legs go rajbullub evening 
must keep eyes open watch everything passes see others 
rajbullub thinks pass muster take going daylight come time reach point safe begin attempt 
watch peasants 
saying may necessary take disguises 
observe traders soldiers even fakirs 
see walk different mien 
trader slow sober 
man wears sword walks certain swagger 
fakir everything turns whines threatens sometimes mumbles prayers sometimes shrieks top voice 
riding shooting lad spend time garden women 
go town keep eyes open 
bear mind learning lesson life depends upon perfect every respect 
first disguise speak rajbullub get ready tomorrow evening 
dress peasant mysore differs little save wears rather clothing necessary warm climate 
chapter disguise 
following evening dick appeared room others sitting dress rajbullub got similar peasants 
boys already told shortly going journey would necessary travel disguise warned matter spoken anyone 
early respect dick strength activity inspired much shaken discovered unable either ride shoot father narrative adventures scouting surajah completely reinstated high opinion 
entered however burst laughing 
two ladies could help smiling dick long joined laugh 
felt uncomfortable enough started almost similar dress surajah although one criticise appearance 
presence mother aunt felt strangely uncomfortable 
never mind dick uncle said encouragingly 
boys would feel uncomfortable dressed european fashion 
talking make first attempt sitting heels 
dick squatted knees nearly touched chest moment later lost balance toppled amid roar laughter 
next time balanced carefully 
right dick 
get accustomed time 
must see already good deal done thought pass native 
remember must able balance sitting still must able use hands cooking purposes example eating anything may without losing balance without showing balancing 
much difficult thought uncle 
course always seen natives squatting like seemed natural never struck difficult 
say beginning hurt already 
shin bones aching horribly 
yes strain comes boy 
got stick muscles never called play way get accustomed work 
understand uncle 
arms began climb 
stand longer 
get fly dick rolled side 
tried short rest trial 
gave limped stiffly divan said feel one kicking shins nearly broken mother 
kicked pretty badly several times fights rough fellows home shadwell never hurt like rubbed aching legs ruefully 
well uncle much obliged putting practising position 
seemed would quite simple thing walk along quietly move arms never thought 
wonder mother never told things learn squat heels time 
would difficult learn five six years ago anything like heavy 
never occurred dick 
wish 
thought foreseen every difficulty never came mind order pass native must able sit like one 
ah well shall learn time mother dick replied cheerfully 
every exercise hard first one soon gets accustomed 
dick threw usual energy new work 
although morning first woke shins caused acute pain always spent half hour practice 
afterwards would sit time allowing water tap side bath flow upon aching muscles 
would dress soon breakfast go run garden 
first shamble gradually terrible stiffness would wear would return house comparatively well 
evening practice longer kept aching pain became unendurable 
end four five days scarcely able walk time matters improved three weeks later could preserve attitude half hour time 
respects training gone uninterruptedly every day 
went town accompanied sometimes rajbullub sometimes surajah disguises either peasant soldier trader learned walk carry accordance dress 
putting disguises painted solution could easily washed return palace always wore european dress 
careful rajah said 
course mohammedans aught know may act agents spies tippoo english agents spies mysore 
one send word taken indian attire believed undertake mission would add considerably difficulties dangers 
one outside circle ever sees boys except european dress rajbullub tells single instance disguise suspicion excited question asked people various classes converse streets 
another month passed time dick could without great fatigue squat heels hour time 
date departure drew near mother became nervous anxious 
shall never forgive come back said one day alone 
feel selfish really strength conviction people would laugh whimsical absurd risking substance shadow imperilling life boy upon faint chance may find husband 
know even uncle although always kind assisted every way power little belief success search although sees bent upon says nothing might dash hopes 
evil comes dick shall never forgive 
shall feel sacrificed sort hallucination 
say mother dick replied came entered plans implicit faith right 
continue account even tomorrow taken 
course see plainly enough chances greatly ever hearing anything father taken place campaign seen must many british captives still hidden away among hill forts quite possible may among 
even say probable chances greatly even thought smaller much smaller believe still consider duty go try find 
even happen never come back blame sending going free indeed feel much duty even turn round ask stay still think right undertake mission 
indeed mother see great danger fact scarcely danger rate unless find father 
might certainly risk attempting get away lucky enough discovering weigh instant 
find seems risk mere nothing 
surajah wander enlisting garrisons forts 
find prisoners shall take early opportunity getting away 
places doubt shall able learn men garrison whether prisoners without forced enter although great forts like savandroog outradroog considered important defences kept secret none garrison allowed leave discharged old service occasion precaution case less important places 
thus see shall simply wander keeping eyes ears open finding either peasants soldiers whether prisoners 
wish could go dick 
used think work searching father begun could wait patiently result instead find even anxious nervous shadwell 
quite understand mother much trying work sitting waiting actively engaged 
thing must promise trouble help think sitting fretting shall worry infinitely otherwise difficulties may encounter 
must remember shall surajah 
capital companion always able advise upon native business 
plucky fellow trust anything would 
preparations departure began earnest 
discussion arms taken last decided safety could carry nothing beyond matchlock pistol sword 
great pains taken selection matchlocks 
armoury several weapons high finish silver mountings belonged rajah father grandfather 
tried two proved accurate chosen 
dick found indeed distances hundred yards quite equal english rifle brought 
silver mountings taken pieces differed way appearance general use among peasantry 
pistols chosen equal care 
swords finely tempered steel blades removed jewelled handles substituted rough handles ordinary metal 
ten gold pieces sewn underneath iron bands encircling leathern scabbard many bosses shields five pieces soles shoes 
waist sashes ordinary receptacle money carried small bag native silver coins 
last ready hour daybreak dick took cheerful farewell mother hearty one uncle surajah passed town struck hills 
carried bag slung shoulder well filled provisions small water bottle hung upon matchlock change clothing 
folds turban dick packet powder used making dye could time renew brown shade began fade 
time words spoken 
dick knew although mother borne bravely till last would break soon left thought might never see weighed heavily upon 
surajah contrary filled elation prospect adventures dangers silent simply felt present young lord humor speech 
soon sun rose dick shook depression 
considerable distance hillside 
path people tripataly occasion visit mysore still less desire visit mysoreans 
periodically raids made upon villages plains marauders hills mostly passes ghauts thirty forty miles left right little state nestling foot hills part escaped visitations british become possessed territories hills hoped finally ceased 
nevertheless people always prepared visits 
every cultivator pit stored harvest except much needed immediate wants 
pit lined mats others laid grain 
two feet soil placed mats ground ploughed indication existence hiding place 
town surrounded wall sufficient strength withstand attacks parties marauders custom keeping man watch tower still maintained 
foot tower stood heavy gun whose discharge would warn peasants miles round enemy calling near hasten shelter town men villages distance could hurry wives families hiding places among hills 
dick surajah need path well acquainted ground often wandered nearly crest hills pursuit game 
hour noon took seats rock shaded sun rays sitting partook hearty meal 
occasion haste prepared rest heat day passed 
fairly surajah dick said stretched comfortably 
thinking almost long remember hardly believe come pass 
thought short time lord 
surajah dick interrupted 
know arranged first call purseram unless get accustomed calling lord hearing others 
forgotten surajah replied smile went 
short time since sure going ever hoped time would come instead dull work drilling men placing guard might opportunity taking part war adventure indeed thought asking lord uncle permit go away one company regiments learn business 
since english become masters longer war rajah rajah used olden times way man spirit gain distinction 
adventure far better much danger need caution well courage 
dick nodded 
caution coolness courage think surajah 
case find father grave suspicion falls us need courage 
well mysore see little chance suspicion falling upon us 
agreed first make seringapatam avoiding much possible places way inquiries whence come may made us 
city shall safe questions travel thence hard manage learn places prisoners may likely kept 
besides father likely anywhere tippoo may since army marched away ordered prisoners brought hill forts seringapatam 
sun lost power proceeded way 
start timed first week would moonlight would therefore able travel night arrived seringapatam 
considered necessary first two three nights tale coming village near frontier way join tippoo army would seem natural enough villagers might question 
continued course nearly midnight time completely fatigued choosing spot sheltered bushes lay sleep 
took another two days clear broken country greater portion part journey performed daylight 
occasionally saw distance small forts guarded every road plateau 
always gave wide berth although according terms peace evacuated might still occupied parties tippoo troops 
indeed news arrived since army left represented tippoo making every effort strengthen army fortresses prepare renewal war 
several times saw bears abounded among ghauts beheld two tigers crossing nullah 
however matters think neither flesh skins bears would use 
work severe glad last reached level country 
upper valleys opening seen small villages 
near one slept morning saw inhabitants hindoos fearlessly went talked order gain information position forts learn whether bodies tippoo troops likely met

evident tippoo hated hindoos 
forced change religion need fear betrayed except pressure desire win tippoo goodwill 
yes might case fairly well would scarcely among poorer classes 
besides even living among would reason suspecting story

desire things get service kind palace 
six days travel saw walls seringapatam 
dick made many inquiries last halting place position fords side town learned leading fort guarded 
ford opposite town freely open traffic could crossed without question country people although watch kept see none numerous prisoners escaped 
therefore crossed river water little knee deep 
questions asked guard passed appearance differing way peasants neighborhood 
quarter mile walk entered town 
open undefended wall 
streets wide laid right angles

streets however presented busy appearance 
thronged soldiers 
battalions recruits passed along evident tippoo power raise strength army former level

said decide whether think trusted secret sure slight reason come accursed city 
dick felt could safely speak would find native valuable ally 
therefore told story without concealment 
except exclamation surprise broke lips dick said english old man listened without remark finished 
tale indeed strange one said heard story 
looked something ordinary assuredly nothing strange 
truly english wonderful people 
marvellous one come way beyond black water seek father lost many years ago 
methinks blessing surely alight upon filial piety find father yet alive 
deem search useless one 
thousands englishmen massacred last ten years 
hundreds died disease suffering

many officers also murdered hill forts generally sent deaths determined upon 
still may live 
men many years yet survive 
main body prisoners kept dick asked 
yes

tippoo times considers strong enough fight english said aim conquest southern india yet fear englishmen thus separates captives lest together plot bring rising 
knows old hindoo population even among mohammedans unpopular 
chelah battalions numbered twelve fourteen thousand made entirely dragged homes districts devastated would assuredly joined prospect success seized opportunity desert six months ago english attacked camp across river 
tell way best serve 
first place sturdy young peasants wanted army assuredly many days find ranks whether like tippoo way particular gets recruits

garrisons seldom changed 
soldiers allowed take wives families much prisoners dungeons

whether caught tippoo vengeance falls upon companions 
flogged ironed kept without rations weeks living live upon charity guards 
attempts escape 
man knows whether gets dooms companions torture perhaps death 
one case remember english sailor one nine attempted get away 
captured killed eight companions hung 
see even one captives sees chance escape take consequences would fall upon companions 
horrible dick said quite understand escape 
question whether prisoners kept dungeons 
think 
tippoo policy make captives useful though one might ironed confined time think kept permanently

bury tonight pray give notice first time cross river

last time english came captured nundidroog hill fortresses regarded impregnable simply governors overconfident defences neglected

wars removal capital building fortification place matters neglected sultan sees necessity putting fortifications places good repair 
papers prepared signed

anything else think like take palace attendant us surajah said 
good man starting suddenly difficulty hiring servants could rely

half hour later started head escort twenty troopers ibrahim riding rear leading pack horse carried change clothes thick cloths keep night dews well stock provisions 
ibrahim also purchased two large dark blankets could used temporary shelter 
surajah felt quite home engaged sort duty performed tripataly one pair dark eyes glanced admiringly two young officers rode ford 
furnished fazli list forts visit order take first list savandroog fifty miles northeast city

surprise troopers surajah gave orders nothing taken force prepared pay provisions required 
soon villagers understood ample supplies brought 
rice grain fowls purchased soldiers forage horses seeing well provided two officers went room placed service principal house village 
ibrahim justified assertion good cook turning excellent curry 
time finished getting dark visiting troopers seeing horses fed well groomed retired bed 
early start made ten clock approached savandroog 
one formidable hill forts mysore stood upon summit enormous mass granite covering base eight miles circuit rising ragged precipices height feet 
summit rock divided deep chasm two peaks crowned strong works capable separate defense 
lower part hill wherever ascent seemed possible protected walls one behind 
natives regarded fort absolutely impregnable stormed troops lord cornwallis 
dick looked intense interest great rock numerous fortifications 
damages committed british guns could seen distance seemed well nigh impossible place could captured 
rode neared entrance wall encircled fort side alone access considered possible 
challenged approached 
ordering troopers remain behind dick surajah rode forward

necessary always vigilant retired shade tree hundred fifty yards gate 
ibrahim spread rugs proceeded light fire prepare pillau rice fowl dick companion regarded rock fixed attention conversed together possibility ascending points steep left undefended walls 
concluded last would next impossible climb rock anywhere side faced save scaling several walls 
finished luncheon gate opened officer four soldiers issued

troopers enter gate proceed farther second wall 
ride must walk dick asked 
ride replied 
road steep nowhere steep horses mount 
party entered gate closed bolted 
troopers dismounted led small barrack surajah dick accompanied officer four soldiers foot rode 
road better one dick expected 
wide enough cart proceed cut solid rock 
turned zigzagged continually angle small fort whose guns swept approach 
passed score gateways defended guns upwards hour climbing quick pace approached one forts summit 
governor met gate 
pardon descending meet said young used journey fatigues much 
dick surajah dismounted former presented two documents 
governor reading pass bowed led way interior fort soon seated divan quarters read circular letter 
glad indeed said finished sultan pleased take consideration many demands made cannon ammunition 
large number pieces past service would dangerous fired aimed scarcely powder enough furnish three rounds 
defences done best strengthen 
idleness bad men soldiers kept well employed repairing effects english fire 
still much yet finished points fortifications might added advantage 
gladly point 
beyond means perceive need blasting many places scarp rock render inaccessible several points active men climb 
work powder required 
would submit hard work needful supply extra rations troops present scale scarcely suffices keep men efficient especially wives families dependent 
doubt sultan accede reasonable requests excellency 
anxious walls forts placed best possible condition defense 
one doubts shall ere long war england although sultan relies much upon large reinforcements promised france entered alliance yet arrived may bear brunt attack english 
heard governor said regret shall feringhees upon us 
mahrattis nizam heed dust sultan could sweep path english terrible soldiers 
fought hyder last war showed valor strangest thing make natives fight bravely 
forts nothing safe 
troops nizam mahrattis combined besiege us feel perfectly safe five hundred englishmen tremble safety fortress 
come hill seen strong yet took place without loss single man 
command kistnagherry time succeeded holding assaults 
war kistnagherry ceded appointed fortress seems even stronger 
commander brave man garrison strong suspicion treachery though last troops seized panic might well saw unable arrest advance enemy defense time stout 
english brought guns thought guns could taken 
knocked defences pieces winning way top one day captured fort hill yonder 
seems miraculous 
coffee brought pipes although tippoo violently opposed smoking one would venture upon use tobacco palace fort old officers like governor distant commands relinquish tobacco 
necessary governor said filled pipe 
country round terribly unhealthy air full fever 
discourage use among men would die like flies smoke keep bad air 
climate indeed best protection fort army sat length time would speedily melt away 
opened box stood divan beside 
copies said taking papers memorials sent sultan guns 
last 
sent two months ago 
see asked forty nine heavy pieces 
thirty replace guns honeycombed split 
eleven new works 
asked thirty two lighter ones howitzers hundred wall guns 
course could less place fort perfect state defense number artillery officer think requisite 
powder ton half siege long one might require ten times much 
eight rounds shot gun ought least fifty heavy pieces twenty defending path hill 
dick made note figures pocket book bought purpose 
provisions governor went ought large stores rice grain 
magazines nearly empty eight hundred men garrison perhaps twice many women children require large store blockaded time 
troops good condition surajah asked 
governor shook head 
many past term service get reinforcements supply places shall venture discharge 
many others wasted fever must say insufficient rations weakens bodies lowers spirits 
long fear attack mattered little english coming shall want well fed contented men oppose 
see stars turbans colonels well officers palace 
fortunate obtaining rank young 
due sultan favor surajah said 
day sports tiger burst sultan zenana lucky enough kill friend killing 
gave brute final coup 
ah performed deed governor said warmly 
heard news one officers leave returned yesterday 
truly gallant action one quickly done 
wonder obtained sultan favor rank colonel 
sportsman young days 
think frightened thought taking peep sultan zenana fighting tiger 
think anything dick said 
heard women scream quite close went assistance without thought whether might ladies zenana servants palace 
indeed saw nothing save tiger vaguely observed women 
well sultan took view matter governor said 
known men put death deeds trifles comparison looking zenana 
colonel send artillery officer horses ride round fortifications brow hill inspect two forts closely point spots appears us defences ought strengthened 
chapter surprise 
dick much pleased governor 
evidently outspoken old soldier though rough bearded face honest kindly expression thought father fell hands think would treated unnecessary hardship though doubt sultan orders would obeyed 
soldier came say horses door went 
officer standing beside governor presented chief artillery officer 
brought horse said 
excellency 
distance great need dismount many times get view walls would worthwhile ride 
case may well walk also dick said 
would rather governor said 
proposed riding thought might tired 
bakir meeram says distance great 
walls exception two forts half mile extent places rocks go sheer defences course unnecessary 
inspect fort first 
went round walls dick companion listening suggestions two officers 
principal one wall raised inside gate 
english last time got rushing tail fugitives 
gates could closed took men completely surprise seized panic 
raise semicircular wall behind gateway thing could occur governor said 
course would gate inner wall immediately behind outer gateway placed might destroyed cannon shots battered outer gate 
therefore put one end inner wall 
gate would generally open case siege blocked stones piled behind placing number ladders men running could get walls however closely pursued could make stand ladders pulled 
would excellent idea surajah said gravely certainly lay sultan 
suppose would propose fort 
thing would observe dick said enemy got footing top could hope make long defense forts 
governor agreed 
strength defense upward road english gained top forts must fall least shall said long governor savandroog fell almost bloodlessly 
forts least die bravely sell lives last 
reason desire shall defended carried sudden rush 
fort visited tour made round walls 
suggestions offered governor officers noted approved 
made dick important part inspection namely examination undefended portion rock 
result showed builders defences acted unwisely trusting solely nature 
many points rock fell away precipices hundreds feet deep 
points although descent less steep far could see altogether unclimbable thought would able judge better 
sentries round night asked governor 

would necessary even enemy encamped 
ride round foot hill leave see save side came place absolutely inaccessible 
view top hill superb 
away northeast governor pointed pagodas bangalore twenty two miles away distance clear air seeming comparatively trifling 
many troops dick asked 
five battalions regular troops three chelah battalions 
hardly counted troops 
never slightest use 
last war ran like sheep 
fancy sultan indeed hardly expect men fight forced ranks made accept mohammedanism 
naturally regard invader enemy deliverer 
course sultan idea since native troops drilled led englishmen fought well chelahs also drilled led englishmen would 
company troops willing soldiers english leading english drill makes fight 
chelahs divided among hill fortresses might good service could far fighting goes battalion mixed men would duty 
course never placed hill forts one would never safe treachery 
even lower walls hands men chelahs would sure manage desert give information defences 
considerable portion upper plateau rock occupied huts troops forts much small contain families 
way back passed 
dick looked anxiously white faces could see none building seemed likely used prison 
returned governor quarters found room placed disposal presently sat dinner 
suppose english prisoners dick said carelessly meal 
governor paused moment replied 
want said shortly 
batches sent sometimes bangalore execution 
loyal subject sultan would work could done elsewhere 
almost executions take place hill forts order suppose may done secretly 
obey orders never see carried 
never even see captives 
done harm one number tried escape blamed 
always shot whether mode execution ordered 
soldier death one choose dead matter little sultan die 
shot soon taken think much held captive years compelled work seems lives spared 
far giving life concerned would willingly orders sultan executions make ill 
lose appetite weeks afterwards 
let us talk something else 
governor puffed furiously away hookah lighted 
conversation turned forts 
find life dull said answer remark dick first one soon becomes accustomed 
wife two daughters ten officers company choose 
officers married gives society 
observe strictly rules plains although ladies course wear veils go beyond house put aside indoors families mix freely get well 
see changes ever made many ladies like wife longer young treat comrades 
morning dick surajah mounted horses took hearty farewell governor rode gate 
soldier sent half hour found escort readiness move 
decided going next fort would ride round foot hill savandroog 
going foot pace scanning cliffs slopes passed 
sometimes reined horses rode little farther back view summit 
completed round agreed two spots seemed ascent barely possible doubtful whether difficulties examined closely would prove absolutely insurmountable 
satisfactory outlook dick said fortunately motive climbing precipice 
certainly places would use party wanting make attack 
first place though might get soft shoes sure english soldiers muskets ammunition pouches could never especially night daytime even body troops strong enough use could get first arrived top would killed others could come assistance stones rolled would sweep behind bottom 
like turning back place went turned horses heads south savandroog farthest north forts visit 
seems even father may 
dick surajah said surprise 
nothing could straightforward governor seemed 
thought even rash speaking frankly us 
think saw fear repeating said surajah 
frank outspoken old soldier evidently disgusted treatment prisoners could mince words yet know absolutely say prisoners 
noticed reply directly question 
contrary distinctly hesitated spoke 
done might well said prisoners 
sent execution 
would natural answer 
instead hesitated began want batches sent sometimes bangalore 
shirk question subject might noticed really answered course important one listening anxiously reply noticed hesitation gave direct answer 
think surajah 
hesitated turned question without answering unless reason could reason surajah suggestion make rode distance silence 
quite evident dick went long pause kind hearted man objects altogether tippoo cruelty prisoners 
therefore captives reason answering likely kindly one 
yes think 
see would consider report sultan particulars gathered fortress 
remarks execution prisoners worthlessness chelah battalions private conversation matter opinion 
supposing prisoners said might anything knew orders inspect report well garrisons defences 
yes might thought surajah agreed mind dick answer time 
trying think 
presently reined horse suddenly 
might reason said excitedly 
governor may one heard taken father moved fort north 
command kistnagherry came war may gone kistnagherry fort north 
see executions fresh batches sent governor would include captive brought 
time existence may forgotten may still living 
would account governor objection answering question would sure tippoo hear prisoner would send orders executed 
may fancy surajah think reason shirked question 
took reins horse started forward 
rode little time silence dick thinking matter becoming convinced right except admitted prisoner governor wished shield might father 
roused last surajah asking question anything would like us dick replied 
could go back 
must visit forts list see find 
quite assured father think present must put aside 
however sha n rest get bottom 
next ten days inspected forts navandroog sundradroog outradroog chitteldroog 
extensive none strong savandroog 
official part business assured english captives contained 
governors said prisoners never kept many days tippoo wished get rid sent 
none governors made objection answering dick questions subject generally adding expression satisfaction prisoners never left long charge 
entails lot trouble governor outradroog said 
watched incessantly one never feels certain may slip away 
look place 
would think one could make escape yet ten years ago fourteen got away 
slid precipice one would thought human could got alive 
retaken except one executed following day sultan furious although fault governor sentries placed everywhere sent seringapatam threw tigers declaring must treachery work 
may sure desire hold english prisoners sent glad indeed orders came execution 
good many ordered starved death 
never waited 
took long 
could guards would smuggle pieces bread lingered weeks merciful finish besides making feel comfortable knowledge chance making escape 
sentries doors well walls fourteen told escaped dug passage back hut chose dark night sound stones dislodged scrambled precipice gave alarm sentries escape discovered 
want prisoners come sleep get order execute 
often come 
prisoners given killed since many left 
upon finishing round returned seringapatam dick drew full report result investigations 
sultan went questioned closely cut good many items gave orders demands complied guns ammunition sent various forts great arsenal capital 
dick depressed result journey 
hopes fallen lower lower fort visited heard story prisoners sent mountain fortresses short time put death 
possible course father might still one towns new levies drilled first thought likely merchant sailor would put work clung belief prisoner savandroog prisoner father would begun despair 
true still many hill forts scattered country unvisited seemed reason prisoners allowed survive forts put death visited among places used prisons 
would give said surajah first place would almost break mother heart 
conviction father still alive never shaken 
supported years believe return tell longer possible hope faith would still unshaken 
would still think pining dungeon would consider given search faint heartedness 
chief reason 
almost much influenced conviction savandroog 
quite admit give reason whatever prisoner father yet get mind 
suppose conviction believe 
impression strongly true one tell absurd real grounds go upon yet shake faith slightest 
perhaps fortunate 
altogether everything turned favourably help thinking alive shall find 
think surajah ought give surajah replied stoutly 
think right destined find father 
hurry 
anything like long time expected fortune say befriended us wonderfully 
well 
positions honor 
could wish nothing better 
well rate wait time dick said 
may sent savandroog leave place find governor whether still prisoner manage obtain sight 
next day dick informed chamberlain officer charge wild beasts fallen disgrace sultan appointed charge 
dick well pleased respects 
work would suit much better examining stores seeing servants palace duty hand lessened chance sent savandroog 
however choice matter surajah cheered saying must mind dick 
everything turned best may sure turn also 
indeed two days later dick congratulated upon change surajah sent tippoo order execution four english prisoners 
dick knew nothing matter surajah return told obliged stop see orders carried poison forced unfortunate officers throats 
horrible said tears eyes 
horrible dick repeated 
thank god put work feel could done 
yet refused carry tyrant orders would meant death us would saved lives poor fellows 
anyhow would done 
soon received order would come would mounted ridden together taken chance 
let us talk something else surajah said 
beasts good health well fed badly miserably cooped 
made great row morning kept men work day cleaning places 
horrible state could get work done threaten report whole tippoo knew would come 
told fazli last night beasts must flesh got order bones kitchens given 
evening dick way apartments one officers going along corridor skirted portion palace occupied zenana figure came suddenly behind drapery door dropped knees beside seizing hand pressed forehead 
appearance indian girl dress one attendants zenana 
child said 
must mistaken someone else 
bahador said wanted thank 
one attendants saw go along corridor time ago ever since watched evening whenever could get away unobserved hopes seeing 
lord tiger standing came rescue 
greatly hurt pushed tiger burst save seized one paws tore shoulder unhurt 
ever since hoping time would come could thank saving life 
glad done child 
best retire zenana 
would good found talking 
girl rose feet submissively saw face dim light burnt corridor hitherto noticed 
exclaimed start english yes sahib 
brought eight years ago 
fourteen 
english girls older given away officers sultan 
afraid shall ere long 
dreaded much oh sahib favorite sultan 
would give mind much 
dick reply heard distant footfall 
go exclaimed 
someone coming 
speak day two 
returned room told surajah happened 
rate give fresh interest said 
terrible think young english girl tippoo power give whenever likes one creatures 
course according english notions still young girl people marry girls age child different altogether 
suspect english 
told discovered heard footstep distance 
shall see tomorrow next day 
running great risk surajah said gravely 
much risk think dick replied 
little slave girl tiger standing fired doubt save life would natural enough would meeting speak express thanks 
would good excuse surajah agreed 
suspicious tyrant like tippoo might well insist pretence girl really giving letter message one inmates zenana 
dick silent time 
careful said 
must certainly see seems present whatever risk may must try save poor girl fate awaits 
conceal however much may refuse admit hopes finding saving father faint indeed although girl nothing feel mission entire failure could take home us restore friends 
think went answer grave shake surajah head would add danger getting away 
know try escape caught lives forfeited case disguised boy could travel without attracting observation alone 
would missed hours left would reason whatever connecting departure 
say surajah made mind course come fresh time think way 
still seem time leaving comes whether ride openly tippoo officers whether go disguise ought great difficulty taking away us 
see give opinion present surajah replied 
think add difficulties however may go say managed 
think surajah would worth however great difficulties might 
think grief parents must feel loss joy restored 
see would great loss time obliged take tripataly first come back renew search 
would take week going returning passes open us difficulties would nothing went back scouting expedition 
besides time vigilant along frontier war two countries tippoo anxious news movements taken 
talk war though tippoo makes disguise fury losses especially coorg taken evidently bent upon fighting take long time get army efficient state repair fortresses complete new works defense getting restore confidence soldiers 
think fully four five years ready fight 
rate get well away girl ought difficulty getting across frontier 
would mean fortnight lost search father anyhow making progress way long stop 
drawback would far see lose benefit official positions unless happen sent orders hill forts position hamper movements 
besides still badges office tippoo official orders governors 
possibly news disappeared might reach governors forts neighborhood would likely travel far 
officers frequently fall disgrace either killed thrown tigers fact missing would scarce excite remark heard would suppose either secretly made away learned tippoo displeased us fled 
surajah nodded 
confidence leader complete always ready follow unquestioningly 
one thing surajah dick concluded 
state things last much longer anyhow next time might ordered see execution english prisoner would mean soon received command make bolt 
see stay case may last many days 
would rather run risks carry order 
two evenings later dick went corridor hour met english girl
