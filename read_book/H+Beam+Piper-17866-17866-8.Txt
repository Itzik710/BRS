yes five thousand dollars appraising collection offered ten third interest kathie said retracting chair lately vacated gladys fleming 
makes sense ah get kathleen mavourneen ritter asked 
care pistols wants jeff find fixed accident fleming 
heard big long shaggy dog story exactly happened everybody supposed time 
hope got recorded told purpose 
rand picked outside phone dialing 
moment girl voice answered 
carter tipton law office good afternoon

buzzed another phone 
jeff rand line announced 
clear slightly harvard accented male voice took

want little information 
busy okay directly 
replaced phone turned disciples 
client said wants two jobs done one fee 
getting pistol collection sold one job 
exploring whys wherefores quote accident unquote 
hunch probably nothing much better something sour accident 
expects find evidence effect rosemont going collection 
excluding possibilities work line unless find differently 
five thousand cover jobs 
think kathie asked 
look kathie 
got far arithmetic school suspect mrs fleming got least far long division 
reasons stated simply handled collection business anything like reasonable fee told five thousand thinking would stop 
knew something else mind went detail death husband good told 
sorry say ten thousand think bought price cheerfully 
thinks lane fleming murdered 
well face told right professor expound ritter said 
heard supposed shot rand began 
colt type percussion revolver 
know like 
know enough lane fleming know much experience old arms 
believe buy pistol without carefully examining believe bring thing home start working without seeing caps nipples charges chambers loaded

use oily rags guns kathie objected 
seen often enough 
honey ritter told 
yes 
brought home revolver neglected condition rand said 
either surface rusted filthy gummed oil dirt 
even mrs fleming mentioned point length time spent cleaning would justify inference 
would taken apart smallest screw cleaned everything carefully put together finished would gone surface oiled rag hanging wall 
would certainly surface oiled removing charges ever 
assume revolver found holding presumably one killed another one 
would assume killer particularly familiar subject firearms antique care maintenance 
hollering whooping hysterics throwing nobody noticed switch ritter finished 
wonder happened one really cleaning 
may possibly find rand said 
general incompetence murder committed gives plenty room hope may still lying around somewhere 
well thought might suicide kathie asked 
briefly dismissed thought almost rand told 
two reasons 
one suicide mrs fleming want poked willing let ride accident 
two doubt man prided gun knowledge fleming would want self shooting taken accident 
damn sure want friends go around saying dope know loaded doubt even expect people believe accident 
shook head 
inference draw somebody murdered fleming faked evidence intended indicate accident

well exactly 
see premix little business foods industry goes something sweet 
sweet fact one really big fellows national milling packaging going rather extreme lengths effect merger 
mill pack par quoted around premix par mill pack offering two one share exchange would little less four one value

fact minor infraction ethics mention 
file burn box rand promised 
matter premix want merge lane fleming since held fifty two per cent common stock try anything 
anything short retiring fleming graveyard rand amended 
would murder motive nicely fleming objections merger mainly sentimental 
premix baby least kid brother 
father started mixing pancake flour back first world war lane fleming peddled spring wagon 
worked nice little local trade finally state wide wholesale business

premix became sort symbol achievement fleming

emanating suspect sources interested shaking less sophisticated small shareholders merger 
story always approximately lane fleming saw company drifting reefward unwilling survive shipwreck performed seppuku 
family supposed faked accident afterward 
dismiss whole thing rather less subtle bit market manipulation chicanery 
smoke screen cover defects camouflaging murder accident rand added 
tipton nodded 
could agreed 
say somebody dislikes looks accident starts investigating 
runs miasma suicide rumors promptly shrugs whole thing 
fleming killed family made alterations passing accident 
families suicides known

regular defense depth system accident line penetrated suicide line back rand said 
well last years seen defenses depth penetrated monotonous regularity 
jeeped couple interrogate surviving ex defenders 
guns armor smash 
chapter humphrey goode sixty ish short chunky fringe white hair around bald crown 
brow corrugated wrinkles peered suspiciously rand pair thick lensed black ribboned glasses 
wide mouth curved downward corners expression probably intended stern succeeded pompous 
office dark smelled dusty books 
mr rand began accusingly secretary called make appointment informed retained mrs gladys fleming 
correct 
rand slowly packed tobacco pipe lit 
mrs fleming wants look interests executor late husband estate thought ought talk first 
goode eyes narrowed behind thick glasses 
mr rand investigating death lane fleming wasting time mrs fleming money lectured

usually make mistakes sort 
wrinkles moved goode brow like battalion advancing platoon front 
looked even narrowly rand suspicion compounded bewilderment 
investigate death lane fleming rand continued 
far know mrs fleming satisfied accident 
never expressed belief 
think anything else course goode exclaimed 
telling 
took fresh start 
rumors utterly without foundation course mr fleming committed suicide 
may say nothing malicious fabrications circulated purpose undermining public confidence premix foods incorporated 
thought perhaps mrs fleming might heard decided responsibility bring scotch afraid step might giving rumors fresh currency defeat intended purpose 
oh nothing sort rand told 
least interested mr fleming killed question simply involved mrs fleming wants 
stopped 
goode looking sideways sucking one corner mouth pushing 
facial contortion impressed rand favorably reminiscent high school principal suffered years ago vicksburg mississippi 
rand began suspect goode might another self righteous opinionated egotistical windbag 
men could dangerous usually quite unscrupulous almost always unpleasant deal 
lawyer demanded mrs fleming employ well know rand began fleming pistol collection joint property mrs fleming two stepdaughters extremely valuable asset 
mr fleming spent better part life gathering 
one time another must owned four five thousand different pistols revolvers 
twenty five hundred left heirs represent result systematic policy discriminating purchase replacement inferior items general improvement 
one largest famous collections kind country 
well goode completely depth 
surely mrs fleming think mrs fleming thinks expert advice urgently needed disposing collection rand replied carefully picking words fit estimated goode probable semantic reactions 
utmost confidence ability integrity attorney however realized could hardly describe antique arms expert 
happens expert antique firearms particularly pistols 
collection author number articles subject recognized something authority 
know arms values understand market conditions 
furthermore dealer connected museum mercenary motive undervaluing collection 
mrs fleming retained firearms expert connection collection 
goode looking rand though latter torn mask revealing another entirely different set features underneath 
change seemed welcome one evidently trouble adjusting 
rand grinned inwardly going find new set verbal labels identifications 
well mr rand alters situation considerably said noticeably less hostility 
still bit resentful people right confuse jumping one category another like 
understand trying offensive seems little unusual private detective also authority antique firearms 
mr fleming authority antique firearms manufacturer foodstuffs rand parried carefully staying inside goode aristotelian system categories verbal identifications 
business occupy time doubt interest history development deadly weapons incongruous criminologist industrialist 
doubt mind qualifications check colonel taylor state museum editor american rifleman

goode nodded 
point sort non professional expert free mercenary bias 
nodded taking glasses polishing outsize white handkerchief 
frankly understand purpose mr rand must say quite glad mrs fleming took step 
perplexed deal collection 
realized worth great deal money vaguest idea much could sold best advantage rough guess mr rand much think ought bring rand shook head 
saw twice last time two years ago

however rivers refused take back pistols refund purchase price altered opinion

pierre put finger immediately shabby disreputable specimen rand first noticed 
phew one stinker said 
used nice late sixteenth early seventeenth century north italian pistol covered steel filigree work 
real beauty much better average 
turkish atrocities gresham pointed 
filling pair lazarino cominazo snaphaunces lane fleming paid seven hundred back mid thirties pay cent much even 
worth easy thousand

well go collection rand told 
note anything find missing

colt waistband 
working rapidly dismounted taking barrel cylinder cleaned thoroughly putting together 
pierre gresham started colts slipped revolver sight rejoined 
took half hour finish gotten completely around collection rand list twenty six missing items including four cased sets 
conservative estimate missing pistols worth ten twelve thousand dollars dealer list value stuff moved replace might value two three hundred serious collector would buy price 
attempt replace cased items cases merely rearranged table avoid conspicuous vacancies 
see thing pierre asked tapping small 
webley scott automatic finger 
rand looked fitted english made silencer

identical pistol used pollard collection 
lane lot stuff famous collections gresham said 
pollard collection sawyer collection fred hines collection meeks collection even old mark field collection sold libbie galleries 
could rank 
think get stuff back hope

ran briefly knew least items likely become public knowledge soon 
observed shop know rivers character think kind crooked deal somebody got double crossed else man caught rivers double crossing 
else rivers somebody else secret common man wanted monopoly killed rivers security measure 
think might fleming pistols depends 
see whether fleming pistols turn anywhere rivers former possession 
personally decided man drinking rivers killed 
indications anybody else shop afterward 
case doubt killer walters 
know snobbish guy rivers 
know seems thoroughly aristotelian outlook identified individuals class labels 
walters course would identified label butler imagine rivers sitting drinking butler 
would drink people thought equals people identified class labels equal social importance labels antiquarian businessman 
sounds like korzybski pierre said turned onto route village headed east 
read science sanity rand nodded 
yes 
first read edition back rereading every couple years since 
principles general semantics come handy business especially criminal investigation work like 
consciousness abstracting realization know something thin film events surface given situation habit thinking structurally individual things instead verbally categories saves lot blind alley chasing 
suggest great many avenues investigation would evident one whose thinking limited intensional verbal categories 
yes 
find general semantics helpful work pierre said 
use plotting story oh oh gentlemen press rand said looking ahead car approached rivers house shop 
good sensational murder story time gift gods 
swarm cars parked front beside red brick house 
among rand spotted gold lettered green sedan new belfast dispatch evening express black coup bearing blazonry new belfast mercury cars couple papers louisburg state capital cars papers far distant pittsburgh buffalo cincinnati 
front shop motley assemblage journalists interviewing photographing undersized runt tan chesterfield topcoat gray homburg hat addressing mr farnsworth

corporal kavaalen standing doorway shop caught sight rand companion got car came meet hustling around crowd shop anybody could notice recognize 
good tip telephone said softly 
mick checked rosemont exchange

pierre look around shop see stuff 
followed kavaalen door rear shop one cecil gillis carried kentucky rifle afternoon 
beside rivers car long workbench garage piles wood cardboard cartons stacks newspapers barrel full excelsior evidently used preparing arms shipment 
also large pile old pistols number long arms 
rand pawed among pistols state police corporal said junk

many partially dismantled parts 
certain heap junk weapons conceal anything value returned shop 
pierre waiting rivers desk 
shook head 
thing reported 
found couple fakes ten fifteen altered one way another lot reblued stuff nothing fleming collection 
find rand laughed 
found rivers scrap heap pistols probably contributed parts stuff found said 
course say stuff rivers could bought stored outside somewhere 
even taking fleming butler seriously suspect murder 
fleming butler voice broke 
withholding information rand turned find farnsworth left press conference front crepe soled behind 
withheld theory seems come nothing replied 
kavaalen told da rand 
cooperating us added 
sergeant mckenna instructed us give every consideration 
seems number valuable pistols stolen collection late lane fleming rand said 
suspected butler stolen sold rivers thought possible might also killed rivers silence transaction 
shrugged 
none stolen items turned nothing connect thefts death rivers 
good heavens certainly suspect prominent respected citizen like mr rivers receiving stolen goods farnsworth demanded aghast 
respects rand hooted 
rivers notorious swindler reputation among arms collectors country 
expelled membership national rifle association misrepresentation fraud 
even swindled lane fleming pair fake pistols week fleming death 
reason man olsen inclined suspect stephen gresham trouble rivers crooked deal rivers put 
fortunately mr gresham since cleared suspicion says cleared farnsworth snapped 
still suspect 
sergeant mckenna says corporal kavaalen declared 
cleared 
guess get around telling 
went explain long distance call furnished stephen gresham alibi 
gresham home nine twenty two rand added 
eight witnesses wife daughter captain jarrett fianc e miss lawrence philip cabot adam trehearne colin macbride 
farnsworth looked bewildered 
told demanded sulkily 
sergeant mckenna busy think kavaalen said insolently 
supposed report anyhow 
man olsen tell us checked telephone company 
farnsworth tried ignore questioning pierre time gresham arrival home turned rand wanted know latter interest case 
rand told work connection fleming collection producing humphrey goode letter authorization 
farnsworth seemed impressed way coroner kirchner still puzzled 
understood retained stephen gresham investigate murder said 
talk olsen saw rand pounced 
odd mention telephone thing yes true 
agency handles sorts business 
two operations mutually exclusive even thought might related shrugged 
well believe rivers nothing pistols say stolen fleming collection farnsworth asked 
rand shook head ambiguously farnsworth took negative answer question intended 
say mr gresham completely cleared suspicion complicity murder mr rand helping us want stick around till case closed corporal kavaalen threw perceiving drift farnsworth questions 
sergeant mckenna worked together given us lot good tips 
understand rand took mr gresham retain merely help clear 
accept kind retainers 
retained find murderer arnold rivers intend continue working case 
hope friendly spirit mutual cooperation exist office agency exists state police 
certainly want work cross purposes regular law enforcement agencies 
oh certainly course 
farnsworth seem like idea apparent opening objection 
rand exchanged mendacious compliments pledged close cooperation practically everything draw sign treaty alliance 
farnsworth corporal kavaalen accompanied rand pierre jarrett front door 
reporters ravening outside must spotted rand entered waiting come set monstrous ululation appeared doorway 
farnsworth beaming approval rand assured press mere spectator state police efficient district attorney scott county situation well hand arrest expected within matter hours 
pierre hurried car drove away 
chapter neither spoke moment two 
left criminological journalistic uproar rivers place behind approaching village rosemont pierre turned rand 
know said disciple korzybski came pretty close confusing orders abstraction couple times back 
showed stephen home rivers taking phone call little ten 
talk clearing completely overlooking possibility came back rivers philip cabot left gresham place rand eased foot pressure gas spared young jarrett side glance returning attention road ahead 
understand pierre hastened add believe stephen fool enough kill rivers fake north cheney producing inferences abstracted descriptive data pierre working case like resemblance opinions statements may make purely due conscious considerations policy rand told 
want farnsworth mick mckenna going around bitching operation 
feel justified eliminating gresham strength phone call satisfied regardless semantics involved 
right thing worrying ease seem talked farnsworth laying gresham 
olsen single track minds 
may dismiss telephone alibi mere error mortal mind go right ahead building kind ramshackle case gresham 
since picked entry want scratch damn wish could think walters could sold pistols well rivers involved somehow killed pierre wondered 
hey maybe walters sold pistols umholtz big crook rivers quite smart 
rand nodded thoughtfully 
maybe 
suppose rivers found tried declare 
stuff would worth least ten thousand doubt whoever bought paid walters two 
umholtz rivers income bracket difference might worth killing 
right 
umholtz infantry war served twenty eighth division 
trained use bayonet 
pick short mauser weight balance springfield 
well know killer need trained use bayonet rand pointed 
mick mckenna made point afternoon 
lot war movies showed bayonet fighting pretty nearly everybody knows technique used 
unarmed probably unsuspecting victim like rivers great deal proficiency needed 
slowed car 
road asked

space trails worlds wonder stories mags like

best stuff goes astonishing 
parenthetically judge magazines names 
seems convention use hyperbolic names science fiction magazines heritage might called earlier ruder day 
astonishing really hard work enjoy 
working one based j w dunne time theories know 
think rand said 
polydimensional time based effect dunne observed described dreams obviously related waking event preceding rather following event related 
read dunne experiment time years war nothing better recorded dreams month 
got doubtful fair examples two unmistakable dunne effect dreams 
never got anything would help pick race winner spot rise stock market though 
well know case record man dream hearing radio narration english derby including announcement hyperion pierre said 
dream six hours race tallied closely phraseology used radio narrator 

picked copy tyrrell science psychical phenomena leafed 
fellow cash rand asked 

quaker violently opposed betting 

handed book rand

rand sat edge desk read section indicated three pages length 
well damned said finished 
idea anybody passing chance like enrich literally smote vitals 
see british society psychical research checked case got verification couple independent witnesses 
spr vouches story must mccoy toughest minded gang confirmed skeptics anywhere christendom 
take attitude toward evidence might advantageously copied district attorneys met one county exception story working oh based dunne precognition theories plus ideas plus theory alternate lines time sequence alternate probabilities pierre said 
see situation half hour later still arguing multidimensional universe rand remembered dave ritter rosemont inn 
looked watch saw five forty five inquired telephone 
yes course 
pierre took back parlor dialed inn inquired mr ritter new belfast registered yet 

moment later speaking ritter 
jeff gawdsake come ritter advised

tony ashe steve drake dispatch express harry bentz mercury joe rawlings ap man louisburg christ knows 
damn thing going turn another hall mills case look meet beer joint two miles new belfast side rosemont route white red trimmings place big pabst sign front 
try get without letting couple reporters hide luggage trunk 
okay see directly 
rand hung spent next minutes breaking away pierre mother went car 
trust dave ritter thought pick place malt beverages sold rendezvous 
dave coup parked inconspicuously beside red trimmed roadhouse 
opening glove box rand took two percussion revolvers shoved trench coat one either side pulling belt hold place 
went roadhouse felt like damon runyon twelve gun tweeney 
found ritter last booth engaged finishing bottle beer 
rand ordered bourbon plain water ritter ordered another beer 
stuff tip left kathie ritter said taking couple closely typed sheets handing across table 
said whole business 
rand glanced 
tipton neatly concisely summarized provisions lane fleming also listed fleming life insurance policies beneficiaries including partnership policy lives fleming dunmore anton varcek paying survivors 
see gladys geraldine nelda get third fleming premix stock rand commented 
certificates transferred sign voting power board directors 
evidently fleming approve feminine touch business 
yeah dandy ritter asked 
directors elected majority vote stockholders 
voting power majority stock makes present board self perpetuating responsible 
thinking 
according tip board one hundred per cent favor merger national milling packaging 
suppose fleming knew must considerable intramural acrimony subject still alive 
since opposed merger intended committing suicide would made arrangement least one would suppose 
well rand asked since worried suicide rumors goode use one argument would utterly disprove reason want call attention fact fleming death makes merger possible well would calling attention fact merger made fleming death necessary ritter pointed 
poured beer glass 
angle butler livery supposed bring brought tux borrowed striped vest theatrical property exchange brought dago 

makes think flemings going needing new butler going poison one one exceeding duties rand said 
supposed clean pistol collection 
content cleaning 
know butler 
went length reasons thinking described modus operandi thefts 
theory far able prove going put arm walters right middle dinner roast half served 
want ready step vacancy thus created 
going busy pup fireplug factory rivers thing need checking upping done inside fleming household 
went meticulous detail explain rivers murder 
work ready start buttling 
disencumbering two percussion revolvers laid table

want careful handle may want puncturing rivers though inclined doubt 
get tell yes whether reblued replated back strap trigger guard rivers

want know gun ever rivers shop important thing 
uh huh

waitress wandered back see wanted anything else gave small squeak surprise saw two big six shooters table 
rand ritter repeated orders brought back drinks colt leech rigdon sight 
way see everybody within light year rivers killing trying pin medal somebody else ritter saying 
lawrence girl afraid young jarrett done right away sicced onto gillis 
gillis lose time putting mckenna farnsworth onto gresham 
gresham one patsy ready supposed dig one 
jarrett first chance gets introduces umholtz 
stared beer though thought ultimate verity might lurking somewhere suds 
think might possible rivers bumped fleming spite getting killed later asked 
anything possible rand replied except structural contradiction involved like scoring thirteen one throw pair dice 
yes could 
way flemings leave garage open long cars anybody could sneaked house garage gone library gunroom 
question mind whether rivers would known 
lawsuit criminal action fleming going start verified sources independent goode good sound motive 
say took leech rigdon away leaving colt fleming hand selling collector put hundred pistols would good way disposing 
understand trying buy colt get circulation 
rand sipped bourbon 
leaves us question killed rivers 
well fleming dead matter whether murdered died old age walters starts robbing collection 
sells pistols rivers ritter reconstructed 
rivers want around shop till time cool stores umholtz character seems plenty crooked deals rivers past 
pistols worth ten grand nobody knows rivers umholtz rivers drops dead sudden nobody know except umholtz couple years get sold money 
yes dave good sound murder 
rivers would sit drink umholtz umholtz could take mauser rack right front rivers rivers suspect thing till late 
course depends upon two unverified assumptions one pistols sold rivers two rivers stored umholtz 
three walters stole pistols first place ritter added 
know possible somebody else house might stolen 
yes 
said anything possible within structural limits possibilities exist different orders probability 
try consider possibilities case indefinitely numerous best screen low order probabilities list high order probabilities revise list new data comes light 
well told think walters good suspect 
seen household think walters personally loyal lane fleming believe feels loyalty anybody else exception gladys fleming 
might keep quiet missing pistols thief dunmore varcek either girls done stealing tell gladys pass 
would glad anything could used others 
hand stolen pistols wanted poking around brought least handle collection
