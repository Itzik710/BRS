something nobility surely man man ought play part leave false position especially could question means 
would come empty handed far indeed 
oh unlucky fact still happened care sorrow never never would speak 
last three friends awake particular morning nine ten clock indeed dirk already two hours factory lysbeth buying provisions market place accomplished excellent officer captain count juan de montalvo 
seconds dark eyes opened stared ceiling collecting thoughts 
sitting bed burst prolonged roar laughter 
really whole thing funny man humor contemplate without moved merriment 
gaby dirk van goorl furiously indignant helpless lysbeth solemn fat headed fools netherlanders supper fashion played tune whole pack though strings fiddle oh delicious 
reader time may guessed montalvo typical spaniard romance indeed history 
gloomy stern even particularly vengeful bloodthirsty 
contrary clever utterly unprincipled man sense humor gift bonhomie made popular places 
moreover brave good soldier certain sense sympathetic strange say bigot 
indeed seems rare thing days religious views enlarged none 
conduct therefore time time affected passing spasms acute superstition totally uninfluenced settled spiritual hopes fears condition found gave great advantages life 
fact suited purpose montalvo prepared moment notice become lutheran calvinist mahomedan mystic even anabaptist principle would explain easy artist paint picture likes upon blank canvas 
yet curious pliancy mind lack conviction absolute want moral sense ought given count great advantages conflict world reality main source weakness 
fortune made soldier man filled part would filled part 
nature intended play actor day day posed mimed mouthed life character though never character principally none 
still far montalvo something solid genuine something good bad 
rarely view hand circumstance must plunge deep find dwelt strong cruel spanish spirit would sacrifice anything save even advance 
spirit lysbeth seen looking eyes yesterday knew race lost prompted try kill adversary although killed attempt 
see last time twice least life destined meet tremble power 
short although montalvo man really disliked cruelty could upon occasion cruel last degree although appreciated friends desired could foulest traitors 
although without cause would hurt living thing yet cause sufficient would cheerfully consign whole cityful death 
cheerfully would regretted end much often afterwards might thought sympathy even sorrow 
differed majority countrymen age would done thing brutally honest principle rest lives rejoiced memory deed 
montalvo ruling passion war women money 
care money since miser inveterate gamblers never saved single stiver 
wanted spend stake upon dice 
thus variance taste countrymen cared little sex even like society passion rest thought something bore 
care intensely admiration much better game hand would take enormous trouble fascinate even serving maid fish girl 
wherever went ambition reported man admired fair city attain end offered upon altar numerous love affairs amuse least 
course indulgence vanity meant expense since fair require money presents pursues well dressed horsed able things finest style 
also relatives must entertained entertained impressed sense honor guests grandee spain 
grandee never cheap profession indeed many pauper peer knows day rank without resources terrific burden 
montalvo rank well born man whose sole heritage ancient tower built warlike ancestor position admirably suited purpose said ancestor namely pillage travellers neighbouring mountain pass 
however travellers ceased use pass reasons robbery became longer productive revenues montalvo family declined till present date practically nil 
thus came status last representative ancient stock soldier fortune common type endowed unfortunately grand ideas gambler fatal fire expensive tastes usual pride race 
although perhaps never defined clearly even juan de montalvo two aims life first indulge every freak fancy full next secondary somewhat nebulous establish fortunes family 
quite legitimate aims times fishers troubled waters generally caught something men ability character might force way splendid positions reason led success 
yet far rate spite many opportunities succeeded although man thirty 
causes failures various bottom lay lack stability genuineness 
man always playing part amuses every one convinces nobody 
montalvo convinced nobody 
discoursed mysteries religion priests even priests days part stupid felt assisted mere intellectual exercise 
theme war audience guessed object probably love 
love song inconvenient instinct apt assure lady immediately concerned love self 
less mistaken usual women went nearest mark 
montalvo real aim self spelt money 
money large sums wanted way meant win 
even sixteenth century fortunes lie hand every adventurer 
military pay small easily recoverable loot hard come quickly spent 
even ransom rich prisoner two soon disappeared payment debts honor could avoided 
course remained possibility wealthy marriage country like netherlands full rich heiresses difficult high born handsome agreeable man ruling spanish caste 
indeed many chances changes time come length montalvo must either marry ruined 
station debts especially gaming debts enormous creditors met every turn 
unfortunately also creditors persons ear people authority 
last came intimation reached scandal must abated must go back spain country happened least wish visit 
short sorry hour reckoning hour overtakes procrastinators arrived marriage wealthy marriage way wherewith could defied 
sad alternative man excellent reasons wish marry faced 
thus came suitable partie leyden count montalvo sought well favored well endowed jufvrouw lysbeth van hout companion great sledge race taken much trouble ensure friendly reception house 
far things went well opening chase proved distinctly entertaining 
also society place appropriation public festival long moonlight tete tete must common gossip talk would quite prepared amount attention might see fit pay lysbeth 
indeed pay attention unaffianced woman whose rank lower means greater course knew name coupled dirk van goorl 
perfectly aware also two young people attached walked home together previous night dirk possibly motives favored semi intoxicated confidence effect 
affianced matter indeed affianced would matter still dirk van goorl obstacle therefore although seemed good fellow sorry dirk van goorl must got way since convinced lysbeth one stubborn natured creatures would probably decline marry young leyden lout vanished 
yet wish mixed duels reason duel unexpected may always happen would poor end 
certainly also wish mixed murder first intensely disliked idea killing anybody unless driven secondly murder nasty way coming 
one could never quite sure light despatching young netherlander respectable family fortune would looked authority 
also another thing considered 
young man died impossible know exactly lysbeth would take death 
thus might elect refuse marry decide mourn four five years practical purposes would bad 
yet dirk lived could possibly persuade transfer affections seemed therefore dirk ought decease 
quite quarter hour montalvo thought matter given determined leave things chance least inspiration came splendid heaven sent inspiration 
dirk must die dirk must live continued existence must price hand lysbeth van hout 
half fond man believed probable would delighted marry anybody else order save precious neck kind sentimental idiotcy nine women ten really enjoyed indulgence 
moreover scheme merits every one good turn 
dirk would saved extinction grateful lysbeth besides earning honor alliance perhaps temporary would able go life wrapped heavenly glow virtue arising impression really done something fine tragic montalvo providence humble purveyor blessings would also benefit small extent 
difficulty could situation created could interesting dirk brought pass would give lady opportunity exercising finer feelings behalf heretic well pope heretic ever fellow heretical cut fellow flat faced sanctimonious looking fancy dark colored stockings observed heretics male female wore dark colored stockings perhaps way mortifying flesh 
could think one thing young man drunk much last night 
certain breeds heretics mind drinking much 
also best could slip sometimes learned old castilian priest taught latin humanum est etc 
summary reflections 
save situation within three months must united holy matrimony lysbeth van hout 
proved impossible remove young man dirk van goorl path overmatching lady affections playing jealousy query could woman egged becoming jealous flounder fellow marrying one else pique stronger measures must adopted 
stronger measures consist inducing lady save lover death uniting marriage one sake would violence conscience manipulate business 
plan would best put execution proving lover heretic unhappily could proved still must figure capacity occasion 
meanwhile would well cultivate society mynheer van goorl much possible first person circumstances montalvo would naturally wish become intimate secondly quite certain individual cash lend 
researches heretics invariably cost money involved services spies 
obviously therefore friend dirk dutch flounder man provide butter going fried

would two men dare great deed upon spaniards ship burnt score two large boats 
dawn see mast vessel attack boats thinking find treasure 
well win aboard manage fire matches may fewer spaniards left plague us suggested foy 
believing blown one trouble money added martin 
oh plan good dangerous 
come let us talk 
dawn broke flood yellow light surface haarlem mere 
presently direction spanish vessel still burning sullenly came sound beating oars 
three watchers swallow saw two boatloads armed men one small sail set swooping towards 
within hundred yards martha muttered time foy ran hither thither candle firing slow matches also make sure cast candle among handfuls oil soaked shreds canvas lay ready bottom hatchway 
others without spaniards able see slipped side little vessel shallow water clothed tall reeds waded island 
firm land ran hundred yards till reached clump swamp willows took shelter behind 
indeed foy climbed trunk one willows high enough see reeds ship swallow lake beyond 
time spaniards alongside swallow could hear captain hailing leaned taffrail commanding board surrender pain put death 
man stern came answer scarcely strange seeing dead pilot hans talked misty dawn whose body martin lashed thus deceive 
fired pilot took notice began clamber board ship 
presently men first boat sail set except two steersman captain dress demeanor foy took one eyed spaniard ramiro although far make sure 
certain however man mean board swallow sudden put boat wind catching sail soon drew clear 
fellow cunning said foy martin martha fool light tarred canvas seen smoke drawing hatchway 
enough fire one night thinks leave mates quench added martin 
second boat coming alongside went foy surely mine spring 
scarcely time yet answered martin matches set six minutes 
followed silence three watched listened beating hearts 
heard voice call steersman dead answering voice officer boat foy right supposing ramiro warning beware treachery 
suddenly arose shout mine mine found one lighted fuses 
running boat said foy captain sailing farther 
heavens scream 
words passed lips tongue flame shot skies 
island seemed rock fierce rush air struck foy shook tree 
came dreadful thunderous sound lo sky darkened fragments wreck limbs men gray cloud salt torn shreds sail cargo fell everywhere beyond 
five seconds three shaken unhurt clinging ground 
dark pall smoke drifted southward foy scrambled tree 
little seen swallow vanished utterly many yards round lay wreckage strewn water black ink stirred mud 
spaniards gone also nothing left save two men boat rode unhurt distance 
foy stared 
steersman seated wringing hands captain whose armor rays rising sun shone brightly held mast like one stunned gazed place minute ship troop living men 
presently seemed recover issued order whereon boat head went began glide away 
best try catch said martha standing could see also 
nay let answered foy sent enough men account shuddered 
master grumbled martin tell wise 
man clever allowed live else would accompanied others board perished 
oh sick replied foy 
wind powder shaken 
settle mother martha leave peace 
martin turned speak martha 
chuckling madness hate glory great revenge slipped away knife hand discover whether perchance powder blasted spaniards still lived 
fortunately shock killed even first alarm thrown water 
length martin found clapping hands crooning dead body shattered one could tell manner man belonged led away 
although keen enough chase late traveling strong wind ramiro boat vanished 
chapter xv senor ramiro foy van goorl magic could seen passing mind fugitive boat sailed swiftly away scene death ruin bitterly indeed would cursed folly inexperience led disregard advice red martin 
let us look man goes gnawing hand rage disappointment 
something familiar face bearing still gallant enough fashion yet observant would find difficult recognize senor ramiro handsome courtly count juan de montalvo twenty years

innocent officer died rascal ramiro died without good looks

although unlucky man wickedness prospered still resource courage

strangely enough however time senor ramiro appeared another part spain success practiced notary man affairs
