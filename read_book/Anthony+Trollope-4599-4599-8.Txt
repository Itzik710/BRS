speak great house allington 
great surrounded much exquisite nobility park appurtenance graces habitations old landed proprietors 
house graceful 
built days early stuarts style architecture give name tudors 
front showed three pointed roofs gables believe called gable thin tall chimney stood two chimneys thus raising three peaks mentioned

door jutting porch means center house 
entered one window right hand left three 
line five windows one taking place porch 
know beautiful old tudor window stout stone mullions stone transoms crossing side side point much nearer top bottom 
windows ever invented sweetest 
allington think beauty enhanced fact regular shape 
windows long windows high

lay away sight full mile back house account less avail fitting preservation foxes 
house stood much near road purposes grandeur purposes ever swelled breast squires allington 
fancy ideas rural grandeur altered since many older country seats built 
near village way afford comfort protection patronage perhaps also view pleasantness neighborhood inmates seemed object gentleman building house old days 
solitude center wide park site recognized eligible 
cottage must seen unless cottage orn gardener 
village abolished must got sight 
sound church bells desirable road profane vulgar travel right must distance 
old dale allington built house thought differently 
stood church village pleased vicinity sat close god tenants 
pass along road guestwick village see church near left hand house hidden road 
approach church reaching gate two hundred yards high road see full front great house 
perhaps best view churchyard 
lane leading church ends gate entrance mr dale place 
lodge gate generally stands open indeed always unless need cattle grazing within requires closed 
inner gate leading home paddock gardens house another inner gate thirty yards farther take farmyard 
perhaps defect allington farmyard close house 
stables straw yards unwashed carts lazy lingering cattle homestead screened row chestnuts glory flower early days may row england surpass beauty 
one told dale allington dale former dale place wanted wood would pointed mingled pride disdain belt chestnuts 
church say fewest possible number words 
church think thousands england low incommodious kept difficulty repair often pervious wet yet strangely picturesque correct according great rules architecture 
built nave aisles visibly form cross though arms clipped trunk separate chancel large square short tower bell shaped spire covered lead irregular proportions 
know low porch perpendicular gothic window flat roofed aisles noble old gray tower church regards interior dusty blocked high backed ugly pews gallery children sat end church two ancient musicians blew bassoons awry looked though would fall pulpit ugly useless edifice high nearly roof would allow reading desk hardly permitted parson keep head free dangling tassels cushion 
clerk also beneath holding third position somewhat elevated upon whole things quite would 
nevertheless place looked like church hardly say much modern edifices built days towards glory god 
looked like church less walking passage pews visitor trod upon brass plates dignified resting places departed dales old 
church village stood vicarage position small garden vicarage stretched churchyard backs village cottages 
pleasant residence newly built within last thirty years creditable ideas comfort entertained rich collegiate body vicars allington always came

much needful say allington great house squire village 
small house speak separately chapter 
chapter ii two pearls allington mr crosbie mere clerk 
sarcastic condemnation spoken miss lilian dale sister isabella referred gentleman shall much concern pages 
say mr crosbie hero seeing part drama cut fragments 
whatever magnificent may produced diluted apportioned moderate quantities among two probably among three four young gentlemen none vouchsafed privilege much heroic action 
know call mere clerk lily 
mr fanfaron mere barrister mr boyce mere clergyman 
mr boyce vicar allington mr fanfaron lawyer made way allington last assizes 
might well say lord de guest mere earl 
mere earl 
ever done anything except fat oxen one say 
know mean mere clerk much man public office yet mr crosbie gives airs 
suppose mr crosbie john eames said bell tone voice seem inclined undervalue qualifications mr crosbie 
john eames young man guestwick appointed clerkship income tax office eighty pounds year two years ago 
johnny eames mere clerk said lily mr crosbie bell mr crosbie mere clerk course older john eames longer suppose eighty pounds year 
mr crosbie confidence 
general committee office know believe pretty nearly management whole 
heard bernard say six seven young men course know office 
tell bell mr crosbie swell 
lilian dale right mr crosbie swell 
may perhaps best explain bernard mr crosbie 
captain bernard dale officer corps engineers first cousin two girls speaking nephew heir presumptive squire 
father colonel dale mother lady fanny dale still living torquay effete invalid listless couple pretty well dead world beyond region torquay card tables 
made quite career nineteenth dragoons 
eloping penniless daughter impoverished earl lord de guest 
conclusion event circumstances afforded opportunity making conspicuous gone declining gradually world esteem world esteemed first made good running lady fanny till slippered years lady fanny unknown except among torquay bath chairs card tables 
elder brother still hearty man walking thick shoes constant saddle colonel nothing beyond wife title keep body awake fallen asleep somewhat prematurely among slippers 
lady fanny bernard dale son 
daughters dead married one living among card tables 
parents bernard latterly seen much duty due attention fifth commandment required 
also making career obtained commission engineers known compeers nephew earl heir property three thousand year 
say bernard dale inclined throw away advantages means intend speak dispraise 
advantage heir good property manifest advantages beyond merely fiscal man thinks throwing away expects another man 
moneys possession expectation give set head confidence voice assurance man help much walk life owner simply use abuse 
bernard dale say often talk uncle earl 
conscious uncle earl men knew fact 
knew would otherwise elected beaufort aristocratic little clubs called sebright noble blood called question never alluded specially knew speak one world aware side placed circumstances birth 
thus used advantage abuse 
profession equally fortunate 
industry small wakeful intelligence aid patronage got till almost achieved reputation talent 
name become known among scientific experimentalists one invented cannon antidote cannon man understanding cannons well fitted look invented others would honestly test antidote honestly seeing thin minded men hardly go proof matter without pre judgment minds rate appearance honesty world might satisfied 
way captain dale employed much home london called build barracks nova scotia make roads punjaub 
small slight man smaller uncle face like 
eyes nose chin mouth forehead better less high pointed better formed brows 
wore moustaches somewhat hid thinness mouth 
whole ill looking said carried air self assurance confident balance gives grace young man 
staying present time uncle house delicious warmth summer yet month july past intimate friend adolphus crosbie mere clerk readers may choose form opinions matter guest house 
inclined say adolphus crosbie mere clerk think would called even lily dale given signs swell 
man becoming swell swell order could possibly known lily dale must ceased mere clerk process 
moreover captain dale would damon pythias might fairly said mere clerk 
could mere clerk got either beaufort sebright evidence former assertion made lily dale strong evidence latter assertion strong mr crosbie certainly swell 
true clerk general committee office 
first place general committee office situated whitehall whereas poor john eames forced travel daily lodgings burton crescent ever far beyond russell square dingy room somerset house 
adolphus crosbie young private secretary afterwards mounted office quasi authority senior clerkship bringing seven hundred year giving status among assistant secretaries like even official point view something 
triumphs adolphus crosbie 
intimate assistant secretaries allowed whitehall room arm chair would entitled stand upon rug sebright speak rich men listened rich men men also handles names adolphus crosbie done make minutes discretion papers general committee office 
set gates city fashion taken storm perhaps speak propriety picked locks let 
walks life somebody london 
man west end know adolphus crosbie knew nothing 
say intimate friend many great men even great men acknowledged acquaintance adolphus crosbie seen drawing rooms rate staircases cabinet ministers 
lilian dale dear lily dale reader must know dear story nothing love lily dale lilian dale discovered mr crosbie swell 
bound say mr crosbie habitually proclaim fact offensive manner becoming swell become altogether bad fellow 
expected man petted sebright carry allington drawing room would johnny eames never petted one mother 
fraction hero advantages back beyond fashion given 
tall well looking man pleasant eyes expressive mouth man would probably observe whatever room might meet 
knew talk something justified talking 
butterfly dandy flew world sun warmed prettiness sunbeam 
crosbie opinion things politics religion philanthropic tendencies age read something formed opinion 
perhaps might done better world placed early life whitehall public office 
might earned better bread open profession 
matter bread fate adolphus crosbie time decided reconciled fate inexorable 
slight patrimony hundred year fallen share 
beyond salary office nothing else income thus made lived bachelor london enjoying london could give man moderately easy circumstances looking forward costly luxuries wife house stable full horses 
enjoy good things world would known john eames made appear fabulously rich eyes brother clerk 
lodgings mount street elegant belongings 
three months season london called master neat hack 
always well dressed though never overdressed 
clubs could live equal terms men ten times income 
married 
acknowledged could marry without money would marry money 
put aside within reach comforts marriage 
however present moment inquire curiously private life circumstances new friend adolphus crosbie

wish could understood without description two pretty fair haired girls bell tallest prettiest whereas lily almost pretty sister perhaps attractive 
fair haired girls like mind eye distinct portrait fear shall able draw manner make distinct others 
something usual height slight slender proportions 
lily shorter two difference trifling hardly remembered unless two together 
said bell prettier perhaps spoken justly simply declared features regular sister two girls fair soft tint color relieved whiteness complexion rather acknowledged distinctly seen 
telling tale health absence would told tale present coming sickness yet nobody could ever talk color cheeks

flaxen hair yet light

nevertheless lily head quite lovely sister form perfect simple braids wore hair require great exuberance quantity 
eyes brightly blue bell long soft tender often hardly daring raise face lily rounder brighter seldom kept want courage fixing pleased 
lily face perhaps less oval form less perfectly oval sister shape forehead think bell chin something slender delicate 
bell chin unmarked whereas sister dimple amply compensated deficiency beauty 
bell teeth even sister showed teeth frequently 
lips thinner think less expressive 
nose decidedly regular beauty lily nose somewhat broader 
may therefore understood bell would considered beauty family 
perhaps general impression made girls whole tone appearance absolute loveliness features grace figures 
dignity demeanor devoid stiffness pride maidenly modesty gave airs 
always apparent sense security women receive unconscious dependence mingled purity weakness 
two girls never afraid men never looked though afraid 
may say little cause kind fear allude

mrs dale said nothing 
time given use judgment nothing said moment johnny visit 
anybody since went whoever stay long 
poor johnny eames said bell

young man loved loved sort admiring affection accorded mr crosbie 
johnny eames could accepted suitor pet 
mrs dale bell felt 
yet loved love distant modest respect restrained speech regarding 
poor johnny young hardly yet hobbledehoyhood would easily recover blow remembering perhaps feeling advantage slight touch passing romance 
thus women think men love young love vain 
johnny eames rode back guestwick forgetful spurs gloves stuffed pocket thought matter differently 
never promised success passion lily indeed always acknowledged could hope actually promised another man good married less broken hearted former hopes high 
never dared speak lily love conscious knew dare stand one convicted loved vain 
rode back thought also love many pleasant thoughts lotharios juans may presumed enjoy contemplate successes
