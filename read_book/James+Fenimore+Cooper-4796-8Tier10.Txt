chapter viii 
ay fare well fair gentleman

tyro believes vessel capsize every puff wind practiced seaman alone knows danger truly besets particular form 
thus harry mulford mexican schooner went related close preceding chapter

mulford swam ease force difficulty sustaining rose schooner settled new berth hauling vessel bottom immediately

mulford difficulty finding bridget whose exclamations murther help l lup jasus similar cries led directly spot fast drowning senseless struggles 
seizing arm active young mate soon placed feet though cries cease ordered mistress keep silence 
thus rescued whole companions immediate danger mulford began think future 
seized sudden surprise vessel sink minute unable account unusual fact 
former occasion schooner gone almost soon fell floated much buoyancy leave keel bilge one side quite clear water 
one main hatches cabin doors booby hatch doors forward open water required little reflection part mulford understand circumstance lives depended 
mate soon ascertained truth however may well explain reader fashion order put level young seaman 
puff wind little squall struck schooner unfavourable moment safety 
lost way tacking hull moving ahead happens craft thus assailed motion power wind expended direction necessary capsize 
another disadvantage arose want motion 
rudder acts solely pressing water vessel meets useless possible luff throw wind sails usually practiced fore aft rigged craft moments peril 
consequence united difficulties shifting cargo hold tenderness craft force squall schooner gone far carry three openings interior suddenly water remained held pressure cargo rolled leeward 
water completely covered openings hatches schooner must sunk minute two time mulford got companions safe bilge 
completely submerged continued circumstance alone prevented vessel sinking following simple explanation show 
person put empty tumbler bottom upwards bucket water find water rise within tumbler inch 
point arrested resistance air unable escape compressed narrow compass forms body fluid penetrate 
simple familiar principle chemist keeps gases inverted glasses placing shelves slightly submerged water 
thus schooner continued float though nearly bottom upward three inlets open water could penetrate 
considerable quantity element rushed instant capsizing meeting resistance compressed pent air progress arrested wreck continued float sustained buoyancy imparted containing large body substance heavier atmospheric air 
displacing weight water enough buoyancy remained raise keel feet level sea 
soon mulford ascertained facts situation communicated companions encouraging hope eventual safety 
true situation nearly desperate admitting wreck continue float ever since almost without food anything drink means urging hull water 
must float mercy winds waves sea get might soon impossible mulford maintain footing bottom wreck
