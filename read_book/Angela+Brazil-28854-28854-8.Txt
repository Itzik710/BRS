saturday week gipsy shall get one treat get another term 
saturday week something happened 
among various rules briarcroft one strictest forbade boarders go outside grounds without first obtaining special permission miss poppleton 
day girls school wore regulation sailor hat plain band navy blue ribbon boarders distinguish others navy band white stripe 
extremely proud stripes regarded badge superiority similar gold tassels many years ago worn sons nobility college caps oxford 
hats course well known neighborhood nobody lived anywhere near school could possibly mistake briarcroft sailor 
came miss poppleton ears medium one malicious little birds reputation carrying inconvenient pieces information several evenings dusk girl wore boarder hat seen leave garden hurry road returning five minutes later dodge great caution inside gate 
proceeding manifestly irregular highly improper 
miss poppleton first indignant idea one pupils could guilty great indiscretion nevertheless felt solemn duty investigate matter thoroughly either expose offender deny imputation 
particularly annoyed hint came quarter absolutely hostile inclined regard establishment old fashioned air notion room another high class ladies school greyfield 
face reports scandal must instantly suppressed 
arranged therefore careful watch kept school anyone seen going returning surreptitious unorthodox fashion occurrence must immediately reported could act promptly catch delinquent 
said nothing affair girls wish put guard miss edith mistresses instructed use extreme vigilance 
one manifold duties lately heaped upon gipsy shoulders task sorting stockings came wash putting pile required darning 
busy one evening rather uncongenial occupation barely finished necessary counting arranging bell rang preparation 
last days miss lindsay insisted upon gipsy joining others learning lessons usual scolded absent even errand another mistress 
unreasonable reproach seldom fault knowing miss lindsay would expect place hastily put stockings away fled fetch books 
preparation held juniors room girls sitting forms round long table 
gipsy scuttling time avoid mistress censure took seat hetty hancock lennie chapman opening french grammar began write exercise 
junior boarders work exception dilys fenton leonora parker barbara kendrick practising girls take turns use pianos according carefully arranged monthly music list 
gipsy plodded exercise arrived sentence suddenly horrible thought struck 
rather dark linen room order examine stockings better switched electric light 
almost certain hurry forgotten turn 
leaving electric light unnecessarily one gipsy worst crimes negligence miss poppleton often rebuked severely 
principal walk past linen room would certainly enquire last would administer scolding prospect gipsy shivered 
wondered dared ask miss lindsay allow go ascertain 
mild wet evening much darker usual mistress sat reading close window catch advantage fading light 
profile rather stern outline look particularly encouraging gipsy sighed knowing request would probably met prompt refusal 
question braving either miss lindsay miss poppleton wrath perhaps 
twixt two fires hesitated idea occurred 
could get room return place without governess discovering absence would well 
miss lindsay seemed absorbed book long pupils kept quietly work took particular notice 
stated seated close window girls placed round long table end nearest open door unoccupied 
gipsy hastily scribbled scrap paper going bolt give away finger lips silence showed two neighbors lennie hetty 
quietly cautiously dropped form began creep underneath table direction open door 
lennie hetty glance paper comprehended scheme moved nearer together lest absence betrayed telltale gap 
girls course noticed occurrence loyal gipsy held tongues made sign 
gently mouse crept whole length table chuckling inwardly fun adventure 
believe anyone school except gipsy would thought rash risky experiment yet entirely forgotten old colonial habits every despite miss poppleton discipline wild spirits would crop assert questionable ways 
miss lindsay read calmly quite oblivious fact one pupils crawling doorway fours greater proportion rest consciously aiding abetting scandalous proceeding 
gained passage safety gipsy sprang feet ran speed linen room 
expected light still switched supreme satisfaction congratulating heartily miss poppleton 
work minute hoped could regain place table way left without missed miss lindsay 
hurrying back along passage leonora coming practising entered opposite direction without seeing gipsy noticing frantic signs went juniors room closed door behind 
peri shut paradise nothing disconcerted girl stood blankly corridor 
poor gipsy indeed dilemma 
utterly impossible open door walk meantime every minute increased probability absence detected 
seemed nothing hang chance dilys barbara might also return practising could persuade one leave door open give opportunity entering 
corridor safe place wait 
mistresses seniors might possibly passing would ask awkward questions 
seemed discreet retire downstairs might catch dilys came library 
large cupboard hall boarders kept outdoor clothes gipsy took refuge listening five difficult bars sonata dilys wrestling wishing friend half hour piano might soon expire 
stood among coats waterproofs peeping small chink door noticed miss poppleton come drawing room cross hall direction library 
gipsy panic fright 
account give retreat discovered alarm made draw breath sharply action combined perhaps dust slight cold alack alack brought terrific utterly uncontrollable fit sneezing 
ha chaw ha chaw ha chaw issued cupboard horrible distinctness 
miss poppleton paused second made instant dart seized culprit midst fourth convulsive gasp 
oh indeed gipsy latimer said principal grimly 
like know much taken aback even sneeze poor gipsy stood looking picture guilt without volunteering explanation presence cupboard 
felt would involve difficulties 
miss poppleton keen suspicious eyes seemed note every detail embarrassment 
gipsy latimer easy enough tell one seen every evening mansfield road gasped gipsy galvanized speech utter falsity accusation 
indeed house 
slightest use denying returned miss poppleton harshly 
might known would 
besides began examine waterproofs hats hanging upon hooks oh wicked wicked girl proof conclusive telling deliberate untruth sailor mackintosh quite wet look marked name try deceive dare miss poppleton indeed indeed mistaken protested gipsy warmth 
want proof look shoes wet 
may think clever able blind whose galoshes like know muddy covered gravel suppose pretend initials g l go along immediately bedroom 
intend sift matter bottom 
repay kindness keeping miss poppleton point view case poor gipsy certainly looked extremely black 
apparently caught act returning clandestine excursion leaving incriminatingly moist garments cupboard surprised 
affair investigated everything seemed indicate guilt 
girls present preparation obliged much confess left room without miss lindsay knowledge crawling table merely piece mischief assumed far graver aspect coupled circumstances 
really serious fault poor gipsy accused 
supposed set school rules deliberately defiance taking surreptitious walk alone evening shielded brazen falsehoods 
remembering first come briarcroft begged permitted go chafed confinement life constantly quoted larger liberty allowed american schools miss poppleton could easily believe would ready break bounds found suitable opportunity though hitherto gipsy strictly truthful previous reputation honor could away circumstantial evidence damp waterproof galoshes 
neighbors reported noticing one briarcroft boarders mansfield road several successive evenings could give account truant personal appearance 
dusk time seen girl sailor hat blue white striped band hurrying rapidly past anxious escape observation 
thought dark hair must fourteen fifteen years age otherwise could identify least 
description might might fit gipsy miss poppleton misled prejudice jumped immediately conclusion miscreant 
harsh girl terribly stern 
considered act basest ingratitude double dyed deceit particularly angry episode brought school discredit 
always prided upon immaculate behavior boarders extremely galling occurrence talked neighborhood 
reputation briarcroft hitherto reproach sustained serious blow might take time recover 
comes fostering children adventurers said bitterly 
feel warmed serpent turned stung pains
