still made close mathematical calculation 
home chance disease well 
home may fall cliff may drowned creek river bathing tree may fall horse may throw break neck may caught winter storm freeze death 
even none things happens die day anyhow 
figures show chance death war twenty five per cent greater home physical activity open air continuously increase life chances thirty five per cent

long wait come bitter despatch telling defeat flying fugitives arriving night exaggerated tenfold 
division dick warner whitley belonged marched long bridge camped near capital would remain sent service 
dick saw capital danger 
troops pouring every train north west 
needed leadership discipline 
bull run stung daunt asked led enemy

dan whitley met old logging friends wisconsin seen years george warner saw two pupils old 
dick inherited sensitive temperament one responded quickly truthfully events occurring foresaw beginning mighty struggle 
capital resolution hardening fight finish knew relatives left kentucky south equally determined 
apparent pause hostilities felt two sections merely gathering forces mightier conflict 
comrades little frequent leaves absence 
one saw man imposing appearance pass pennsylvania avenue 
would caught attention anybody owing great height splendid head crowned snow white hair 
old walked one achieved greatly conscious 
old fuss feathers self said whitley 
general scott 
said dick divined man identity 
eyes followed retreating figure greatest interest 
young hero war great commander carried brilliant campaign capital mexico 
first commander chief northern army foreseeing great scale coming war prepared wide cautious plan 
public sneered demanded instant action defeat bull run result 
dick felt pity man forced bear blame old another chance 
knew present cloud would soon pass away would remembered man chippewa chapultepec 
mcclellan already take place said whitley 
young fellow winning successes western part virginia say genius 
day two later saw mcclellan walking avenue president 
dick never beheld striking contrast 
president elderly great height head surmounted high silk hat made look yet taller face long melancholy wrinkled deeply 
collar wilted heat tails long black coat flapped legs 
general clothed brilliant uniform 
short stocky head scarcely passed president shoulder 
redolent youth self confidence 
showed quick eager gestures emphatic manner 
attracted two boys sergeant shook head somewhat solemnly 
say scott old said gone end 
mcclellan young handle great armies going field 
afraid match old veterans like johnston lee 
napoleon became famous world twenty six said warner 
retorted whitley never heard napoleon 
breed began quit 
soldiers crowding capital full confidence little mac already begun call 
duty followed cheered president entered white house disappeared within doors 
dick friends crowd followed although join cheers lacked faith three thoughtful 
dick soon discovered whitley despite lack education exceedingly observant man clear reasoning mind 
pair worth seeing said sergeant turned away looked lot old abe little mac 
ever think boys big war hands sorts men tellin sorts things tryin pull sorts directions thought think said warner 
event quite sure president great task 
hear south soon quarter million troops field 
position defensive perhaps worth many men 
hence let x equal troops let equal defensive x plus equal half million men number must meet south equal terms 
conquer completely need nigh million 
said sergeant 
shrewd penetrating sergeant whitley dream giant struggle south would tripled defensive quarter million north would almost tripled invading million 
days later regiment marched capital joined forces hills around arlington lay many days impatient inactive 
much movement west heard small battles victory defeat equal 
boys shown much zeal ability learning soldierly duties made orderlies colonel john newcomb taciturn pennsylvanian rich miner raised regiment partly expense showed great zeal union 
learning soldier asking advice certain sergeant whitley judgment give manner befitting one lowly rank 
summer days passed slowly 
heat intense 
virginia hills plains fairly shimmered burning rays sun 
still delayed 
congress shown greatest courage meeting day news bull run come resolving fight war successful end matter happened 
mcclellan drilling preparing public began call action 
richmond cry despite army yet move 
european newspapers came almost without exception sneered northern troops predicted early dissolution union 
monarchy privileged classes everywhere rejoiced disaster threatening great republic safe hesitate show delight 
sensitive proud country dick cut quick warner phlegmatic 
let em bark said 
bark dislike us dislike us fear us 
threatened privilege revolution succeeded republic established 
fact existence threat threat increased years growth 
europe south reason one simplest problems mathematics 
ten per cent admiration southern victory bull run ninety per cent hatred least ruling classes republican institutions wish see fall 
suspect right said dick try harder keep failure 
look goes balloon every day usually late afternoon captive balloon rose northern camp officers powerful glasses inspected southern position watching advance new movement kind 
going day said dick confidently 
colonel newcomb promised take turn ascension comes 
chance week coming tremendously long time seemed dick came last 
climbed basket colonel newcomb two generals aeronauts sat quiet corner 
felt extraordinary thrill ropes allowed slide balloon slowly going almost straight upward 
sensation somewhat similar shook went battle bull run pride came rescue soon forgot physical tremor watch world rolled beneath world seemed left although ropes always held 
dick gaze instinctively turned southward knew confederate army lay 
vast beautiful panorama spread semi circle 
green summer green stained fearfully bull run gone 
grass brown great heats promise autumn soon come height least soft mellow brown dust gone 
hills rolled far away southward horizon rim 
narrow ribbons silver numerous brooks creeks cut country 
groves still heavy dark foliage hung hills filled valley like green bowl 
among clumps trees colonial houses pillared porticoes appeared 
rare beautiful scene appealing great force dick 
nothing tell war save northern forces beneath would look 
look back saw broad band potomac beyond white dome capitol roof washington 
gaze turned south absorbing interest lay viewed quiet country rolling away touched horizon rim 
afternoon growing late great terraces red gold heaping one another sky reached zenith 
try glasses moment dick said colonel newcomb passed boy 
dick swept across south great semi circle new objects rose upon surface earth 
saw distinctly long chain blue ridge rising west blurring distance solid black rampart 
south saw long curving line rising blue plumes 
need colonel newcomb tell campfires army met field bull run southern troops cooking suppers 
doubt cousin harry perhaps others knew 
fires seemed dick defiance union 
well view victory defiance justified fires might come nearer yet 
dick catching tone older men shared views believed first rebellion would last long opinion changing fast talk wise sergeant whitley helping much change 
yet looked glasses saw plume white smoke coming swiftly towards southern fires 
remembered two lines railroad met battlefield giving name manassas junction knew smoke came engine pulling cars loaded supplies foes 
whispered train handed glasses back colonel newcomb colonel generals alike made long examination 
beauregard certainly abundance supplies said one generals 
hear arms provisions coming every train south meanwhile making advance 
advance yet said general emphatically 
mcclellan right making elaborate preparations long drills moving upon enemy 
inexperience want courage beat us bull run 
southerners inexperience 
defensive 
hear tom jackson saved given name stonewall stood firm 
west point 
odd awkward fellow one hardest students ever known 
boys laughed first came soon stopped 
funny way studying standing book shelf instead sitting desk 
said brain moved better way 
heard walked part way virginia reach west point 
hear religious always intends pray going battle 
bad sign us said general 
easy enough sneer praying men remember cromwell 
little shaky history impression cromwell ironsides old praise god barebones rest knelt said words god sang little advanced pikes went wherever intended go prince rupert cavaliers could stop 
said gravely 
man believes thoroughly god afraid die fact rather favors dying field awful foe meet battle 
may side said colonel newcomb 
least great puritan population draw 
one generals gave signal balloon slowly pulled 
dick grateful experience thanked colonel newcomb rejoined comrades 
chapter ii 
mountain lights dick left balloon nearly night 
hundreds campfires lighted hills beyond circle darkness enclosed everything 
still felt sensations one great height seen afar 
rim southern campfires yet mind wondered northern commander allowed remain week week near capital 
fully aware common talk army union reached great numbers magnificent equipment four one able drive southern force away 
yet mcclellan delayed 
dick obtained short leave absence walked campfire knew would find friend george warner 
sergeant whitley showing young recruits cook without waste two gave boy welcome inquisitive hearty 
balloon said warner 
rare chance 
yes replied dick laugh left world way wish leave next sixty seventy years 
wonderful sight george least wonderful thing campfires southern army burning towards bull run 
burnin ought said whitley gulf yet established commissioned non commissioned officers either army 
little mac may great organizer say keep organizin organizin late want 
sound principle lay mr whitley said warner precise tones 
fact may reduced mathematical formula 
delay always minus quantity may represented achievement represented x consequently achievement hampered delay x minus extremely doubtful quantity often amounting failure 
travel another road reckonin said whitley know anything x guess george come place 
full six weeks since bull run done thing 
whitley despite difference rank could yet keep addressing boys first names 
took matter course view fact much older vastly superior military knowledge 
dick continued sergeant sayin cousin town kentucky bein southern army certainly replied dick killed battle feel happened fellow like harry 
little town kentucky pendleton 
descended straight one greatest indian fighters borderers heroes country ever knew henry ware afterwards became one early governors state 
descended henry ware famous friend paul cotter time greatest scholar west 
henry ware paul cotter like old greek friends damon pythias 
harry proud blood veins 
besides cousins things make harry think lot 
oh grand fellow even wrong side dick eyes sparkled enthusiasm spoke cousin comrade childhood 
chances war bring strange situations least heard said warner 
dick meet cousin face face battlefield loaded gun hand would raise gun take deliberate aim square foot air thirty feet head pull trigger 
duty country tells otherwise 
foe trying destroy union 
come armed save union consequently must fire straight air order reduce number enemies 
one enemy many would count anything total 
arithmetic show harry percentage southern army small reaches vanishing point 
borrow george x equals harry percentage nothing equals value hypothetical opportunity nothing x plus equals nothing represents whole affair nothing worth nothing union 
hence obligation shoot harry meet shoot 
well spoken dick said sergeant whitley 
people reckon take duty hard 
one duty another bigger one comes along right place ought tend bigger one 
never shoot anybody heap one three four hundred thousand side 
never thought much old roman father forget name son executed doin exactly right 
never rule oughtn exceptions extraordinary circumstances 
establish principle exceptions replied young vermonter gravely allow dick shoot air meets cousin height battle difficult task establish fails dick according rules logic duty must shoot straight cousin heart 
two looked warner saw left eyelid droop slightly 
faint twinkle appeared either eye laughed 
reckon dick shoots high air said sergeant 
dick pleasant hour friends went back colonel newcomb quarters spent entire evening writing despatches dictation 
hopeful writing portended something days passed despite impatience army public movement 
stories confused uncertain fighting still came west washington bull run perfect peace 
summer passed 
autumn came deepened 
air crisp sparkling 
leaves turned glowing reds yellows browns began fall trees 
advancing autumn contained promise winter soon come 
leaves fell faster sharp winds blew bringing chill rains 
little mac young napoleon many friends loved call continued preparations despite urgings president congress would move 
fatal defect showed destructiveness 
enemy always appeared threefold natural size 
reliable scouts brought back news southern troops manassas full two months victory numbered forty thousand 
northern commander issued statements enemy one hundred fifty thousand soldiers 
demanded forces raised nearly quarter million men nearly five hundred cannon could move 
veteran scott full triumphs honors feeling place old age went retirement 
mcclellan sole command still lingered delayed south making good use precious months gathered forces meet whomsoever came 
youth chafed long waiting 
seemed dick mathematical vermont friend time fairly wasting away feet wise sergeant agreed 
weather grown cold built fires warmth well cooking two youths sat sergeant whitley one cold evening late october big blaze

dick reading letter mother widow lived outskirts pendleton

promised dick faithfully much 
colonel newcomb already formed strong attachment zealous valuable young aide forget words dick said every convenient occasion west 
made urgent representations regiment sent relief struggling northern forces contrived also petitions reach president 
one day order came go st louis halleck command 
instead enter mountains west virginia kentucky help mountaineers loyal union 
accomplished task success proceed greater theater western kentucky tennessee 
wished thought far better remaining washington seemed army would remain indefinitely 
colonel newcomb sitting tent bending maps staff summoned dick 
kentuckian lad said thought might know something region going

dick warner much elated worked night hesitate go sergeant whitley advice instruction 
first spear dawn regiment marched away splendid order arlington washington train bear new fields unknown fortunes ready 
long train many coaches regiment numbered seven hundred men also carried four guns mounted trucks 
coaches primitive pattern 
soldiers sleep seats arms supplies heaped aisles 
cold drizzling day closing autumn capital looked sodden gloomy 
cameron secretary war came see make customary prediction concerning valor victory come 
cold man repellent dick used warmth temperament 
ringing bells heave engine great puffing smoke mighty rattling wheels train drew washington made noisy way toward baltimore 
dick warner seat 
forty miles baltimore slow train would perhaps three hours arriving 
ample opportunity see country examined curious eyes youth 
little see 
last leaves falling trees early winter rain 
bare boughs brown grass went past windows fields deserted 
landscape looked chill sullen 
warner less depressed dick 
even temperament based solidly upon mathematical calculations 
knew might raining today chances several one raining tomorrow 
good cause remember baltimore said 
new england troops fight way capital 
although hold really southern city dick 
border cities southern sympathy swarming people send southern leaders news every movement make 
state moreover assert face world knowledge departure washington already southern hands 
close mathematical calculation chances least ninety five per cent favor statement 
likely said dick sort thing face time invade south 
got win war george hard fighting hard fighting 
guess right 
arithmetic shows least one hundred per cent probability favor suggestion 
dick looked long coach packed young troops 
besides commissioned officers sergeants one coach twenty five 
nineteen twenty coaches 
first depression spirits rose 
temper youth showed strongly 
eager see baltimore train stopped minutes allowed leave coaches 
train turned towards west 
drizzle rain become pour drove heavily could see little outside 
food served noon afterward many slept cramped seats 
dick despite stiff position fell asleep 
middle afternoon everybody coach slumbering soundly except sergeant whitley sat door leading next car 
afternoon night train rattled moved west 
beautiful rolling country left behind among mountains whirling around precipices sharply often sleeping boys thrown seats coaches 
growing used hardships 
merely climbed back upon seats asleep half minute 
rain still fell wind blew fiercely among somber mountains 
second engine added train speed train slackened 
engineer front stared slippery rails could see yards 
pitchy darkness closed ahead hiding everything even peaks ridges 
heart engineer brave man brave soldier battlefield sunk low 
railroads little past infancy first cross mountains 
means certain track moreover rocks forest might shelter ambush 
alleghanies outlying ridges spurs lofty mountains day wild almost inaccessible many places 
nature made formidable barrier great civil war trod look eyes listen ears 
engineer alone anxiety night 
colonel newcomb rose uneasy doze went major hertford engineer cab 
going rate five six miles hour long train winding like snake around edges precipices feeling way gingerly trestles spanned deep valleys 
trains made great roar rattle long ravines gave back rumbling menacing echo 
gusts rain swept faces engineer firemen officers 
see anything ahead canby said colonel newcomb engineer 
nothing 
trouble sir 
clear night worried 
likely steam danger eyes shut 
wild country 
mountaineers main us far north southern line know crossing may undertake raid 
may know said colonel 
washington full southern sympathizers 
stop train canby come first open level space scouting ahead 
engineer felt great relief 
devoutly glad colonel going take precaution 
moment colonel newcomb responsible lives seven hundred human beings aboard train patriotism sense responsibility strong 
train much jolting clanging stopped fifteen minutes later 
dick warner awakened shock sat rubbed eyes 
left train join colonel newcomb might want immediately 
wary sergeant whitley followed silence 
boys found colonel newcomb remaining members staff standing near seeking anxiously discover nature country 
colonel nodded arrived gave approving glance 
two stood awaiting colonel orders neglect use eyes 
dick saw engineer lantern valley learned words valley three miles long width perhaps half mile 
little mountain river rushed center train would cross stream mile 
still raining cold wind whistled mountains 
dick could see somber ridges showing dimly loom darkness rain 
instantly aware tense uneasy feeling among officers 
carried glasses darkness could use 
lights began appear train many heads thrust windows 
go coaches mr mason mr warner said colonel newcomb every light put immediately 
tell orders absolute silence 
dick vermonter work rapidly receiving many curious inquiries went coach coach honestly unable answer 
knew boys situation 
left last coach returned officers near engine train total darkness sound came 
colonel newcomb gave approving nod 
dick noticed fires engine well covered sparks came smoke stack 
standing could see long shape train running back darkness would invisible one hundred yards away 
think thoroughly hidden canby said colonel 
yes sir 
unless located us precisely advance information 
see could find us among mountains darkness rain 
advance information look exclaimed major hertford pointing toward high ridge lay right 
beam light appeared loftiest spur standing first like red star darkness growing intensely brighter burning steady vivid light 
effect weird powerful 
mountain beneath invisible seemed burn like real eye wrathful menacing 
older men well boys held spell 
something monstrous eastern like appearance genie arabian nights 
light remaining fixed least minute began move slowly side side faster 
signal exclaimed colonel newcomb 
beyond doubt southerners 
whatever saying saying somebody 
look toward south ah answering exclaimed major hertford 
wheeled simultaneously another high spur mile south second red light vivid intense first flashing back forth 
mountain invisible seemed swing heavens 
dick standing darkness rain knowing imminent mortal danger either side felt frightful chill creeping slowly spine 
terrible thing feel superior sense invisible foe approaching able know kind striving whence came 
lights flashed alternately presently dropped sky seeming dick leave blacker spots darkness place 
heavy night rain encompassed 
think asked colonel newcomb major hertford 
southern troops beyond doubt 
equally certain warned manner washington departure 
think 
probable saw light signalling knowledge 
seems likely wait far end valley cut us
