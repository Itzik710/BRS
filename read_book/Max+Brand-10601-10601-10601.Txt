riley sinclair rode mountain 
hour stern climbing lay behind sympathy tired horse made draw rein 
sympathy readily tap riley nature 
hossflesh riley purely simply means end 
neither paused enjoy mystery change comes mountains late afternoon early evening 
keen eyes answered purposes never learned see blue shadows meant nothing riley sinclair 
looked kindly upon foothills stepped peaks valley lands meant easy descent 
riley took thorough stock surroundings new country 
yonder slant sun glanced blinked windows must sour creek road town jagging across hills 
riley sighed 
heart despised valley 
black patches plowed land 
scattering houses began foothills thickened toward sour creek 
could men remain little elbow room scowled shadow valley 
small country small men 
pictures failed hold riley sat saddle hand thigh looked scornfully toward sour creek picture make one head lift 
rule horse comes much attention rider riley sinclair came near people saw man nothing else 
good looking one became suddenly aware hundred eighty pounds lithe tough muscle domineering face 
somewhere behind eyes faint glint humor 
soft touch 
hard age thirty thirty five people still young lost illusions youth 
indeed exactly word people haste used describe riley sinclair hard 
resigned descent cramped country beneath banished regret 
first picked objective house distance away near road brought mustang bit touch spurs 
established taut rein preferred sent cow pony slope 
plain mustang hated rider equally plain sinclair perfect touch horse stern wrist pulling bit spurs keeping pony 
spite bulk heavy saddle kept tune gait horse sway body lightens burdens

leaving mountainside struck trot across tableland 
mysterious instinct enabled guide pony without glancing ground sinclair head high carefully examining house 
twice cluster trees obscured time came closely view eye riley sinclair brightened certainty 
length nodding slightly express conviction sent pony shelter little grove overlooking house 
shelter still giving half attention objective ran swiftly weapons 
pair long pistols came smoothly hands weighed nicely cylinders spun 
rifle came case magazine looked thoroughly returned 
done rider seemed peculiar haste go 
merely pushed horse position commanded environs house sat still hawk hovering windless sky 
presently door little shack opened two men came walked path toward road talking earnestly 
one tall riley sinclair heavier little slight man 
went sleepy pony end path slowly gathered reins 
plainly troubled apparently big man troubled 
turned cast hand toward speaking rapidly manner one making last appeal 
murmur voice drifted riley sinclair loud laughter big man drove clearly 
smaller two mounted rode away dejected head remained arms folded looking 
seemed chuckling little man indeed cause riley never seen rider completely place saddle 
pony presently broke soft lope caused elbows little man flop like wings 
like great clumsy bird winged way view beyond edge hilltop 
big man continued stand arms folded looking direction disappeared still shaking mirth 
eventually turned riley sinclair riding sharp gallop 
strangers pass ungreeted mountain desert 
wave arm riley responded bringing horse trot reining close big man 
close hand seemed even larger distance burly figure ludicrously inadequate support narrow heeled riding boots
