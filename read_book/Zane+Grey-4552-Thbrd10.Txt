road empty 
sound broke stillness 
bend joan saw stage coach horses looming seemed gray distance 
jim hurried 
reached stage 
horses restive

strange knew exactly way turn head cross trotted horse fast jim called say could drive pack animal keep gait 
every rod trail lessened burden 
behind something hideous incomprehensible terrible beckoned something beginning seem bright 
ruddy calm sunset flooding hills color 
something called beyond hills 
led straight camp site remembered long came charred logs fire rocks tree lain brought back emotions felt 
grew afraid twilight night settled phantoms stalking shadows 
cleve hurried camp duties went sight wanted cry voice close still trembled cold 
wrapped blankets round held arms yet numb chill dark clamp mind remained 
long lay awake

cleve hung close call pack horse took keener note 
every rough wild mile behind meant much 
halt noon hour 
halt next camp site still darkly memorable joan 
sunset found miles farther divide head lost canon 
joan ate drank slept deep sleep exhaustion 
sunrise found moving winding wild canon made fast travel 
time miles passed swiftly 
noon reached little open cabin dismounted rest drink spring 
joan speak word 
could look cabin almost killed bandit silent lonely weeks nursed back life proof long ride distance helping sloughing away dark deadlock hope brightness 
left place exactly found except cleve plucked card bark balsam tree gulden ace hearts target bullet holes

single tracks sharp clear earth imprinted day 
next morning joan found wild border lay behind dark hateful shadow gloom 
pain remained softened 
could think 
jim cleve cheered 
perhaps brightening responded 
began talk speech liberated feeling 
miles back trail rode side side holding hands driving pack horse ahead beginning talk old associations 
sunset rode hill toward little village hoadley
