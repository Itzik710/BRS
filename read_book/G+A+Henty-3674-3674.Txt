fared news news bad edmund 
danes ever receiving reinforcements mercia scarce day passes fresh bands arrive thetford fear ere long east anglia like northumbria fall clutches 
nay unless soon make head come occupy island forefathers 
shame indeed edmund exclaimed 
know people conquered ancestors unwarlike cowardly would shame indeed saxons overcome danes seeing moreover help god christians danes pagans idolaters 
nevertheless son last five years heathen masters northumbria wasted whole country plundered destroyed churches monasteries 
present made beginning east anglia continue flock soon overrun whole country instead present mere foothold near rivers except come thetford 
among first sufferers seeing lands lie round thetford hitherto hoped would general rising invaders king indolent unwarlike see arouse call ealdormen thanes together united effort late 
already north danes flocking mercia although advent west saxons aid king mercia forced retreat doubt soon pour 
tis pity father saxons one leading might surely defend england danes 
people rise fall upon band northmen arrived would get footing among us 
yes father replied unhappy divisions saxon kingdoms enabled danes get firm footing land 
hope lies west saxons 
lately feud mercia royal families related marriage seeing king mercia wedded west saxon princess alfred west saxon king brother heir throne lately espoused one royal blood mercia 
fact marched call king mercia drove danes nottingham shows west saxon princes alive common danger country joined heartily people east anglia mercians may yet succeed checking progress heathen 
edmund see hope general effort drive danes coasts tis useless us lurk longer 
propose morrow journey north lincolnshire abbey croyland know brother theodore abbot rest peace time watch progress events 
hear people parts aroused lethargy come back fight home lands longer stay east anglia see destined fall piecemeal hands danes journey somerset pray king ethelbert assign lands take thane 
thus talking egbert broiling eels wild ducks fire 
freeman distant relation edmund father eldred ealdorman west norfolk lands lying beyond thetford upon therefore first brunt danish invasion mercia fallen 
made stout resistance assembling people given battle invaders 
however strong numerous force scattered dispersed sought refuge egbert son fen country 
remained two months hopes general effort would made drive back danes convinced present angles disunited join common effort determined retire scene 
suppose father edmund said leave treasures buried yes father replied means transporting ally time return fetch 
must dig big chest take garments may need personal ornaments rank rest gold silver vessels remain till need 
gold silver vessels seem little accordance primitive mode life prevailing ninth century 
saxon civilization indeed mixed one 
mode life primitive dwellings exception religious houses abodes great nobles simple extreme possessed vessels gold silver armlets necklaces ornaments metals rich brightly colored dresses elaborate bed furniture tables household utensils roughest kind floors strewn rushes 
invaded conquered england found existing civilization introduced romans far advance much adopted 
introduction christianity advanced scale 
prelates monks rome brought high degree civilization small extent saxons imitated borrowed 
church held much honor great wealth possessions bestowed upon bishops abbots possessed large temporal well spiritual power bore prominent part councils kingdoms 
even handsome well built monasteries stately services handsome vestments learning lowest ebb low indeed prince alfred desired learn latin could find one father dominions capable teaching studies long time hindered want instructor time ascended throne probably englishman outside monastery able read write fluently 
tell father edmund said meal concluded west saxons since seems must look protection england danes 
prince alfred heard speak terms high praise brother king case reign kent thought though joined west saxon kingdom always ruled eldest son king 
rule edmund seeing troubled times ethelbert came throne thought better unite two kingdoms one crown understanding ethelbert death alfred succeed 
father ethelwulf weak king born churchman rather prince 
nominally reigned wessex kent mercia last paid slight allegiance 
alfred favorite son sent quite child rome visit 
magnificent retinue accompanied alfred visited rome traveling land franks doubtless alfred acquired love learning many ideas far advance people distinguish 
mother osburgha died father started pilgrimage 
king received much honor pope presented gold crown four pounds weight ten dishes purest gold sword richly set gold two gold images silver gilt urns stoles bordered gold purple white silken robes embroidered figures costly articles clothing celebration service church together rich presents gold silver churches bishops clergy dwellers rome 
say people rome marvelled much magnificent gifts king country considered barbarous 
way back married judith daughter king franks foolish marriage king far advanced years judith girl 
ethelbald ethelwulf eldest son acted regent father absence angered marriage raised standard revolt father 
marriage judith crowned queen contrary customs west saxons therefore ethelbald supported people country father return england however father son met division kingdom agreed upon 
ethelbald received wessex principal part kingdom ethelwulf took kent already ruled time father egbert 
ethelwulf died months afterwards leaving kent ethelbert second surviving son 
following year horror indignation people country ethelbald married stepmother judith two years afterwards died ethelbert king kent united wessex dominions consisted kent surrey sussex 
ethelbert reigned short time death ethelred next brother ascended throne 
last year alfred youngest brother married elswitha daughter ethelred mucil earl gaini lincolnshire whose mother one royal family mercia 
short time marriage danes poured mercia north 
messengers sent ask assistance west saxons 
obeyed summons joining mercians marched danes shut strong city nottingham time besieged 
place strong winter hand time soldiers service nearly expired 
treaty accordingly made danes allowed depart unharmed north side humber west saxons returned kingdom 
situation present may sure danes long remain quiet soon gather another invasion ere long may expect another great fleets arrive somewhere coasts every saxon bear arms need take field fight country faith heathen invaders 
hitherto edmund know deeply mourned death mother sisters died infancy feel best terrible time us 
men take refuge swamp forest would hard delicate women men best stand alone able give every thought energy defense country 
tis well approaching age saxon youth wont take place ranks battle 
spared pains training arms though assuredly lack strength yet cope hand hand conflict fierce danes may yet take part battle one side egbert 
thought many things late seems saxons done harm holding people country serfs 
father edmund exclaimed astonishment surely would men free equal 
idea seems strange doubt edmund appears natural men born rule others labor might even without serfdom since know poorer freemen labor serfs receive somewhat larger guerdon toil two races mixed closely together serfdom abolished men free capable bearing arms able show far better front danes seeing serfs three one freemen 
serfs cowardly spiritless edmund said fighting race fell almost without resistance ancestors landed 
race doubt inferior edmund father said seeing neither tall strong saxons old deficient bravery fought stoutly romans hardy ancestors 
hundreds years subject roman yoke occasion use arms lost manly virtues romans left easy prey first comer 
fathers could foresee time would come turn would invaded 
done methinks would set broad line separation britons would admitted latter rights citizenship case intermarriage would taken place freely whole people would become amalgamated 
britons accustomed free institutions taking part wars various saxon kingdoms would recovered warlike virtues would one people resist danes 
serfs form far largest part population apathetic cowardly view struggle indifference signifies whether dane saxon conquer interest struggle nothing lose gain change masters 
edmund silent 
possibility state things serfs men free equal never occurred deep respect father bore indeed reputation one wisest clear headed nobles east anglia seemed strange novel doctrine contained much truth 
still idea strange would son southern planter america half century ago 
existence slaves seemed much matter course horses dogs although accustomed see time time freedom bestowed upon favorite serf special reward services thought general liberation slaves strange almost bewildering lay awake puzzling problem long father kinsman fallen asleep 
chapter ii battle kesteven following morning early little party started

everywhere found monks state alarm progress danes wherever went destroyed churches religious houses slew monks 
eldred everywhere received marked honor known wise valiant noble opinions chances situation eagerly listened found monks halting places prepared need take arms fight pagan invaders mercia wessex done preceding autumn 
travellers arriving croyland warmly welcomed 
heard brother abbot said bravely fought danes near thetford sorely anxious since news came dispersal force 
hiding eldred said hoping general effort would made invaders 
power broken since lands hands 
people east anglia foolishly seem suppose long danes remain quiet time come action 
repent lethargy day danes gather strength burst surrounding country dammed river breaks banks 
brother regard east anglia lost far depends upon hope men kent wessex must look upon champions may yet stem tide invasion drive back danes 
abbey stands perilous position far removed humber many danes find entrance england 
without danger eldred men fens numerous hardy brave offer tough resistance may venture march hitherward hope stay us undertake command may yet long time keep danes doors 
weeks time passed quietly 
edmund spent time hunting generally accompanied egbert 
saxon exceedingly tall powerful man slow scanty speech earned title egbert silent 
devoted kinsmen regarded special guardian edmund 
instructed use arms always accompanied went hunt boar standing ever side aid receive rush wounded furious beasts edmund borne onslaughts would severely wounded killed sweeping blow egbert sword rid assailant

vain algar osgot toley eldred leaders shouted stand firm 
weary long inactivity convinced danes routed saxons pursued across plain 
suddenly danish horse failing break ranks remained apart short distance conflict dashed upon disordered saxons flying infantry turning round also fell upon exulting shouts 
taken wholly surprise confused disordered saxons could offer effectual opposition charge 
danish horse rode among hewing slaying swords battle axes footmen completed work 
minutes saxon band many hours successfully resisted onslaught danes one survived save fleet footed young men throwing away arms succeeded making escape little group consisting algar toley eldred leaders gathered together men broke ranks taken position knoll ground rising plain 
long time resisted efforts whole danes surrounding heap slain length one one succumbed danish onslaught fighting valiantly last

lost sight flashing swords showed struggle still going center confused mass 
edmund knees time rose 
come old boy said hound lay beside watching distant conflict occasionally uttering deep angry growls 
must obey father last command let us away 
took one glance distant conflict turning 
plain nearly finished 
swords well nigh ceased rise fall saw sudden movement throng danes suddenly man burst started headlong speed towards pursued number danes 
even distance edmund thought recognized tall figure kinsman time assure accompanied hound set top speed field battle 
fully quarter mile start active hardy accustomed exercise childhood fear danes would overtake 
still ran hardest 
looking shoulder time time saw first danes pursuing fugitive gaining upon also time increased distance unencumbered shield heavy weapons fugitive kept advantage first gained 
three miles battle field edmund reached edge wide spreading wood 
looking round entered shelter saw flying saxon still quarter mile behind danes despairing taking ceased pursuit 
edmund therefore checked footsteps awaited arrival fugitive felt certain kinsman 
minutes egbert came slackened speed considerably saw longer pursued 
bleeding several wounds necessity exertion passed walked feebly along 
without word flung ground edmund buried face arms lad could see shaking broad shoulders weeping bitterly 
great hound walked prostrate figure gave vent long piteous howl lying egbert side placed head shoulder 
chapter iii massacre croyland edmund wept sorely time knew kinsman agitation could caused death father 
last approached egbert

danes closed closer around us 
still fought till father beaten knee cried fly egbert son 
flung upon danes like wild boar upon dogs suddenness rush heavy blows battle axe cut way 
well nigh miracle could scarce believe free 
flung away shield helmet soon well begun run felt blood gushing dozen wounds knew want strength

sometimes slept farm houses villages everywhere hospitably received known edmund son brave ealdorman eldred news brought disastrous battle kesteven southward march great danish army filled everyone consternation 
maids matrons wept terror thought coming terrible heathen although men everywhere spoke resistance last prospect seemed hopeless even bravest filled grief despair 
many spoke leaving homes retiring wives families serfs herds country west saxons alone appeared hope successful resistance made 
wherever went edmund egbert brought news lamentation woe households entered last edmund said egbert let us enter houses reach end journey wherever go messengers evil turn houses feasting abodes grief 
every night sad story tell witness weeping wailing women 
thousand times better sleep among woods rate among west saxons news may cause indignation rage least arouse brave resolve resist last instead hopelessness despair 
egbert thoroughly agreed lad henceforth entered houses save buy bread mead

union indeed little nominal kings retained thrones paying tribute west saxon monarchs 
egbert predicted tale battle kesteven aroused feeling save wrath desire vengeance upon danes 
swords grasped swore saints happen invaders set foot wessex 
travellers felt spirits rise martial determined aspect people 
sad pity egbert said edmund one day west saxons time unite england firmly together danes set foot island 
divisions rendered task far easy 
northumbria mercia east anglia one one invaded kings fight single handed whereas one strong king reigned whole country force could exerted invader wherever might land danes would never foot soil

first day beat though superior numbers second withstood day although ten one us would never triumphed even men listened leaders kept ranks 
believe even west saxons could fought bravely men day better organized king energetic determined danes invade wessex find opposed whole people instead merely hastily raised assemblage gathered neighborhood

fresh messengers sent throughout country bidding men wessex rally round king fourth morning defeat ethelred found head larger forces fought last battle 
danes moved reading taken post ashdown saxon army approached seen divided two bodies one commanded two kings two jarls 
saxons therefore made similar division army king commanding one division prince alfred 
edmund men sherborne division alfred 
danes advanced attack fell fury upon

time alfred men supported assaults danes hardly pressed prince sent messenger brother urge movement made 
saxons impatient standing defensive alfred saw must either allow charge enemy must retreat 
presently messenger returned saying king tent hearing mass given orders man move disturb mass concluded 
alfred hesitated longer formed men solid body raising battle cry rushed upon danes 
battle furious one 
danes upon higher ground standard planted side single thorn tree grew slopes hill 
towards alfred men fought way 
lesson previous battle lost saxons kept together solid body made way irresistible weight ranks danes 
still latter closed sides fight doubtful king finished devotions led division battle 
long time desperate strife continued great numbers sides killed saxons animated love country hatred invaders humiliation previous defeat fought fury danes began give way 
saxons pressed still hotly invaders presently lost heart fled confusion pursued directions exulting saxons 
danish king bergsecg five jarls two sidrocs osbearn frene hareld slain many thousands followers 
great spoil arms armor fell hands victors 
edmund fought bravely battle head men 
egbert kept beside twice lad smitten knees enemy covered shield beat foe 
young fight edmund said danes taken flight 
need another four five years head stand battle fierce northmen 
break guard sheer weight bore gallantly doubt yet famous warrior brave father 
edmund join pursuit much bruised exhausted egbert men sherborne followed flying danes nightfall 
done well young ealdorman prince alfred said lad battle 
wishing much could past month heard building strong fort deemed better let continue work undisturbed 
finished trust shall often near fear time shall little space peaceful pursuits danes coming hear great troops westward shall many battles fight ere clear land 
days defeat however severe decisive effect modern warfare 
cannons lose great stores fall hands victors 
army simply dispersed component parts reassembled course day two ready reinforcements arrived renew fight 
thus decisive victory ashdown prince alfred saw many victories must prolonged exhausting struggle carried tide invasion would finally hurled back wessex 
next days spent making fair distribution spoil arms among conquerors 
thanes returned home people remainder king entreaty agreed march danes battle fallen back basing joined others coming coast 
royal army advanced fourteen days battle ashdown struggle renewed 
fight lasted many hours towards nightfall saxons compelled retreat moving field however good order spoil fell hands danes 
check great disappointment saxons late victory hoped speedily clear kingdom danes 
indeed taught prudence manner west saxons fought refrained plundering excursions 
two months later saxons called arms 
somerled danish chieftain advanced reading captured burned town 
king marched two armies met merton 
another desperate battle took place 
first part day saxons victorious divisions danish army afternoon latter received reinforcements renewed fight 
saxons believing victory fallen disorder finally driven field 
great numbers slain sides 
bishop edmund many saxon nobles killed king ethelred severely wounded expired days later april rd reigned five years 
buried wimbourne minster prince alfred ascended throne 
ethelred much regretted people accession alfred increased hopes battling successfully danes 
although wise brave king ethelred scarcely monarch warlike people troubled times 
religious exercises occupied large share thoughts 
rule kindly rather strong authority weak nobles 
prince alfred saxons hoped better things 
boyhood regarded special interest affection people father led regard future king 
fact personally consecrated pope appeared invest special authority 
immense superiority learning people greatly impressed 
though gentle firm resolute prompt action daring field 
thus although people regretted king ethelred general feeling hope joy alfred took place throne 
succeeded crown month danes advanced great numbers 
want success attended last two battles damped spirit people small force alfred able advance 
armies met near wilton danes vastly superior numbers posted hill 
king alfred led forces forward fell upon danes bravely saxons fight time day went favourably 
gradually danes driven post vantage hours fighting turned fly merton kesteven impetuosity saxons proved ruin 
breaking compact ranks scattered pursuit danes seeing small number pursuers rallied turned upon saxons driven field bravely 
unless brave saxons learn order discipline king said edmund nobles gathered round evening defeat cause assuredly lost 
proved battle superior man man danes throw away fruits victory impetuosity 
great caesar wrote account battles read latin described order discipline roman troops fought 
always heavy masses even battle heavy armed soldiers kept ranks scatter pursuit enemy leaving task lightly armed troops 
would three four years us teach men discipline order alas time 
danes fallen great numbers every fight ever receiving reinforcements come fresh waves invasion saxons finding efforts valor seem avail nothing beginning fast lose heart 
see small number assembled round standard yesterday yet war beginning 
truly look bad england 
king made strenuous efforts raise army people respond call 
addition battles spoken several others fought different parts wessex ealdormen followers bodies invading danes 
space one year saxons engaged eight pitched battles many skirmishes 
great numbers slain sides danes ever received fresh accessions strength seemed grow stronger numerous every battle saxons dwindling rapidly 
wide tracts country devastated men slaughtered women children taken captives people utterly dispirited depressed longer listened voices leaders refused peril lives strife seemed hopeless 
alfred therefore called ealdormen together proposed since people would longer fight sole means remained escape destruction offer buy danes 
proposal agreed although none hope danes would long keep treaty might make yet even little respite might give heart spirit saxons 
accordingly negotiations entered danes consideration large money payment agreed retire wessex 
money paid danes retired reading used headquarters marched london 
king burhred feeble king mercia could nothing oppose agreed pay large annual tribute 
end till autumn country comparatively quiet 
alfred ruled wisely tried repair terrible damages war made 
edmund looked earldom grew powerful young man nineteen years old 
king alfred deceived moment future 
danes said still england 
east anglia northumbria swarm 
army bought us brother mercia sailed across seas landed france would hope us restless nature allow stay long parts conquered 
anglia king guthrum divided land among jarls seem disposed settle elsewhere care land preferring leave hands former owners till wring cultivators fruits harvest country becomes thoroughly impoverished must move elsewhere 
mercia overrun whensoever choose nothing sweep upon wessex rest england feet hopeless think alone withstand united power 
think must end edmund asked 
tis difficult see end alfred replied 
would seem hope release utterly eaten ravaged england may turn thoughts elsewhere 
already harrying northern coasts france richer prizes mediterranean shores may england longer worth plundering may sail away spain italy 
acted foolishly way fought 
first began arrive upon coasts labored hard build great fleets could go forth meet seas 
indeed might escaped watch landed fleets could cut reinforcements coming thus reached shores could overwhelmed 
even think something might done way purpose build fleet may invade us take station near mouth thames fall upon vessels bringing stores reinforcements 
would give much encouragement people whose hopelessness desperation caused principally fact seems use killing enemy since many ready constantly take places 
gladly undertake build one ship edmund said 
fort finished revenues land could commence ship danes give us time finished would build another 
gladly since seems danes entirely overrun country must take sea turn become plunderers 
view ship built large strong may keep sea weathers home driven england 
must plenty ports france many quiet nook inlet round england one put refit necessary could pick many prize danish ships returning laden booty 
ship could carry strong crew trusty egbert best fighting men able hold even attacked two three danish galleys 
idea good one edmund king said would could carry effect 
thousand times better live free life sea even certain last overpowered danish fleet lurk hunted fugitive woods 
long live must remain among people ready snatch chance may offer striking blow invader 
different 
course edmund said lost mean defend fort extremity still danes conquer lands well refuge 
edmund talked matter egbert warmly entered plan 
long life fight danes ship least fight manfully till end 
must build sea coast time need may destroyed danes 
build parrot 
water deep enough far sea float empty choose spot river runs among woods might hide may last escape attention danes 
must get men crafty ship building one ports sending body serfs rough work 
go exeter first choose us craftsman skilled building ships take council best form size 
must good sail yet able row fast strong crew must room house goodly number rowing fighting men 
edmund might start consult king alfred 
must seen rome ports mediterranean ships use doubtless far advance 
know holy bible thousand years ago st paul made long voyages ships doubtless learned much since days 
edmund thought idea good one asked king make drawing vessels use mediterranean 
king alfred readily egbert edmund journeyed exeter finding man noted skill building ships told object view showed drawings king made 
two one long galley rowed double banks oars heavy trading ship 
would useless shipwright said laying second drawing aside 
would fast enough either overtake fly 
galley would methinks suit well 
seen drawing ship 
war galley used genoese fights african pirates 
fast roomy plenty accommodation crews 
one well manned handled match six least danish galleys much lower water smaller ways 
cost good deal money build ship 
devote revenues land finished edmund said 
place hundred serfs service leave hire many craftsmen may needed 
intend build quiet place deep wood river parrot may escape eyes danes 
shall require seasoned timber shipwright urged 
buy edmund replied shall direct brought river spot 
large heavy shipwright said difficult launch 
methinks best dig hole dock little distance river finished way cut river wide enough pass 
water turned float level surface draw two feet water cut need three feet deep 
best plan far edmund agreed make hole deep build entirely level ground 
needs fill hole altogether bushes cover would seen danish galley rowing river even enemy might enter wood unless made special search could lie chose embark 
shipwright set work draw plans week later sent edmund messenger account quantity size wood require 
purchased 
edmund egbert serfs journeyed spot chosen met shipwright brought twenty craftsmen exeter 
wood brought river craftsmen began cut fitting sizes serfs applied dig deep dock vessel built 
chapter v disciplined band construction ship went steadily 
king alfred building several war vessels ordinary size took great interest edmund craft paid several visits progress 
fine ship said one day vessel approaching completion much larger seas 
reminds edmund indeed size shape purpose ark noah built deluge covered whole earth 
built know escape family destruction 
building time deluge danish invasion sweep land trust success equal patriarch 
shall better noah edmund said nothing save shut windows wait till floods abated shall go seek enemies sea 
respite purchased king danes short one 
autumn bands swarming around borders wessex constant irruptions took place 
edmund received summons gather tenants found longer replied willingly call 
several chief men met represented general feeling prevailed 
men say spokesman explained useless fight danes 
ten pitched battles vast numbers danes slain vast numbers also saxons 
danes already far numerous fresh hordes continue arrive shores fill places killed places saxons empty fighting force far smaller last year 
go fight many battles even victorious hardly hope thing happen 
many thousands slain following year shall vain try put army field match danes filled ranks numerous ever 
long continue fight long danes slay burn destroy wheresoever march remain us fugitives hidden woods 
far better cease resist danes become masters become masters northumbria mercia anglia 
true plundered churches thanes houses stolen worth carrying away taken take leave people alone unmolested till ground gain livelihood 
slay pleasure slaying grievous condition angles wives children free massacre allowed gain livings 
west saxons showed cowards defeated northmen far outnumbering 
dishonor yield rest england yielded fighting bring ruin upon wives children 
edmund could find reply argument 
knew even king despaired ultimately resisting danish invasion listening thanes say retired egbert apart 
say egbert reason arguments use 
neither wives children risk lives well understand much lose chary effort 
say think fair press egbert answered methinks might raise band consisting youths unmarried men earldom 
might train carefully keep always together seeing lands still cultivated able pay assessment may even add since exempt service 
band could train practice could rely upon defeat far larger force enemy would available crew take ship 
think idea good one egbert propose thanes 
proposition accordingly made married men exempt service youths age sixteen unmarried men formed band kept permanently arms 
landowners lost services sons freemen working pay assessment contribute men levy pay additional assessment 
edmund said would pay men composing band wages would earn field would undertake expenses 
long king continues struggle said duty aid escape dangers perils invasion 
danes come near us must perforce fight long continue distance things go peace land 
proposal discussion agreed news caused gladness contentment throughout earldom 
younger men included levy quite satisfied arrangement 
spirit west saxons still high without wives families would suffer absence ruined death eager continue contest 
proposal paid work considered perfectly satisfactory 
men sherborne young leader gained great credit steadiness valor battles four years looked forward fresh victories invader 
result ninety young men assembled service 
edmund sent messenger king saying people utterly weary war refused take arms gathering band young men would ere long join prayed short delay order might get condition useful day battle

leaders also chosen great personal strength 
edmund place horseback middle wedge whence could overlook whole direct movements 
three weeks men could perform simple movements perfection sound edmund horn would run scattered pursuit flight could form line wedge without least confusion every man occupying assigned place 
men delighted new exercises felt confident weight solid mass thickly bristling spears would break danish line without difficulty could draw field perfect order safety case defeat however numerous foes 
two front lines thrust pikes others keeping long spears immovable form solid hedge 
man carried short heavy sword use case fatality wedge get broken 
assured band perfect new exercise edmund marched joined king 
found arrival summons arms everywhere disregarded 
many men indeed come way sufficient form force would enable take field danes 
edmund therefore solicited obtained permission march band endeavor check plundering bands danes already committing devastations throughout country 
rash edmund monarch said handful men grieve indeed aught harm befall 
fall upon small parties plunderers destroy good service compelling keep together raising spirits saxons avoid conflict parties likely defeat 
shall hear us soon promise edmund replied trust news good 
little party set towards border long met numbers fugitives weeping women carrying children old men boys making way neighborhood danes

defeated body danes four times force killed nearly half felt confident tactics adopted would enable future defeat scattered bodies danes might meet 
week battle rested spending time improving drill practicing especially alterations position spears requisite changing defensive attitude pikes right angles face attack spears faces advancing wedge directed forward 
messenger arrived king edmund sent news various successes alfred sent warmest congratulations thanks great results gained small force king confessing unable understand disproportionate numbers edmund could totally routed force distinguished leader haffa

time saxons repulsed every effort lashings oars gave way pressure danish ships drifted alongside thus able attack along whole length bulwarks castles 
saxons hard put superior height still enabled keep danes check 
time five vessels drifting river together 
presently conflict hottest chief sailors made way edmund 
get sails may able draw galleys 
edmund said hardly pressed four one us 
sailors sprang halliards soon great sail rose mast 
almost instantly dragon began glide away galleys 
danes ropes endeavored lash sides severed fast thrown two three minutes dragon drawn clear 
danes betook oars many broken vessels rowing utmost could keep dragon wind blowing freely 
fully half oars dragon broken rest soon manned rapidly drew away pursuers

vessel head brought wind danes ceased rowing 
fate befallen two galleys commencement fight still

dragon waited week end time traces conflict obliterated new oars made 
edmund found difficulty filling vacancies caused fight many young saxons burning avenge sufferings danes inflicted could obtained several times number required room 
therefore enabled pick sturdy fellows accustomed sea 
dragon set sail head laid northward edmund intended cruise east anglia whose shores fleets constantly crossing recrossing denmark 
picked several prizes mouths eastern rivers scarcely strike blow surprised danes appearances great saxon galley 
whenever danes surrendered without resistance edmund gave quarter landed small boats shore ships emptied booty contained burned 
yarmouth captured four danish vessels sailing unsuspicious danger wind veered round north east began blow strongly 
long line sandbanks coast broke somewhat violence sea dragon rode night anchors morning wind continued rise 
sea became violent anchors began drag

oars lashed firmly keep boats approaching sides

crew kept shelter although often struck damage done 
afternoon fleet galleys seen coming river 
danes possessed large number boats yarmouth navigated inland waters far interior 
wind shifted blowing nearly due east edmund egbert agreed upon best course pursued 
case attack could hardly hope finally beat assault large fleet galleys would besides exposed attack boats laden combustibles 
therefore soon galleys seen approaching oars unlashed great sail hoisted best speed dragon advanced river meet foes 
danes gave shout alarm vessel advanced meet water surging white wave bows greater part hurried towards one bank escape shock 
slower movement stouter heart awaited attack storm missiles poured upon advancing boat 
heedless continued way

time running rapidly wind dragon approaching great roman fort whose massive walls struck edmund astonishment 
one seen moving space inclosed

hour labor sufficed block gateway pair massive doors position place defended saxons danes first landing coast

chapter viii cruise dragon night passed without alarm 
gale continued blow fury abated edmund little fear danes would venture upon attack 
indeed reason haste 
saxon vessel waters could return long storm continued blow east 
next day parties danes seen making way across swampy country direction yarmouth 
soon however approached near enough see saxons readiness walls castle retired knowing place could captured nothing short prolonged desperate siege 
fourth day storm abated saxons prepared make way seaward 
wind still blew lightly quarter sails would therefore use 
great oar power confident danish flotilla could defy pursuit 
accordingly embarked loosing moorings rowed towards yarmouth 
chosen time tide running although would hinder progress would equally impede pursuers would enable check vessel time find unforeseen obstacle way 
entered river rowed along quietly neared walls town 
river narrowest saw danish galleys gathered thickly stream 
edmund egbert forecastle presently gave signal men cease rowing 
expected egbert said formed boom across river trunks trees beams lashed together 
make way obstacle removed 
say edmund agree edmund replied 
best keep along close right bank within short distance boom must land greater part men 
must march along bank phalanx others must keep boat moving close alongside forecastle able fire upon danes aid shore drive back make way end boom 
cut lashings whole swing round 
see nature obstacle done best wait tide turns 
first place fewer men needed board ship advance abreast men shore 
second place lashing cut boom swing stream cause confusion among boats behind open clear space us make way 
edmund agreed light anchor dropped dragon rode quietly stream 
great animation evident among danes large numbers crossed river strong force gathered either end boom boats close behind prevent saxons attempting cut lashings 
little uneasiness board dragon saxons confident power close formation force way number enemy would gain assistance fire lofty forecastle doubted able drive back danes destroy boom 
hour tide longer rose

although northmen fought bravely unable withstand steady advance wedge spears many fell beneath rain arrows 
steadily wedge made way reached end boom

egbert foreseen boom swung round swept number danish boats imprisoned shore 
oars soon run men forecastle continued fire danish boats others seizing oars swept dragon along stream 
danes strove desperately arrest progress 
tried run alongside board others dashed among oars impeded work rowers walls town showers missiles poured upon 
tide gaining every moment strength partly drifting partly rowing dragon like bull attacked pack dogs made way river 
every effort danes board defeated many boats sunk last made way open sea 
sails hoisted soon left pursuers behind 
sea course turned north picking prizes way took station mouth humber

young sir jarl asked 
one king alfred ealdormen wessex edmund name

minutes later danish vessel continued way dragon took station look 
deep water picking one two small prizes edmund egbert determined return home 
probable danes would soon take alarm despatch fleet attack

midwinter cruised along southern coast england without perceiving single hostile sail 
lay week mouth thames saw four large danish vessels making way river 
vessels largest size strongly built full men saxons judged strong attacked company 
northmen seeing golden dragon flying mast head saxon ship made towards keeping close body dragon sails oars easily left behind danes giving pursuit continued way 
dragon fell wake followed distance hoping one might prove slower others might night get separated 
nightfall however danes lit cressets tar hemp enabled keep close together sent wide circle light could perceive dragon venture approach 
two days nights dragon followed patiently 
weather change egbert said third morning 
methinks storm brewing northmen may well get separated may pick one away fellows 
darker darker grew sky wind soon blew furious gusts raising sea heavy saxons obliged lay oars 
nightfall blowing furious gale 
gathering darkness flying scud ships danes lost sight little consequence attention saxons directed safety 
next three days position one greatest danger 
rag sail set ran gale south west 
every wave overtook threatened destruction ship dragon light buoyant ably handled rode safely waves 
fourth morning wind still blowing fiercely although force degree moderated 
daylight dawned edmund egbert hardly left poop since storm began looked anxiously ahead 
surely edmund see dark mass ahead egbert exclaimed 
minute two edmund gazed silently ahead 
egbert said rocky coast 
see white fringe waves strike light became clearer imminence peril grew distinct 
lofty iron bound coast rose front extended far eye could reach either hand 
seas broke terrible force base sending spray far cliffs

would useless man said 
could make way teeth gale 
see edmund said present rushing destruction 
bring wind may run distance along coast driven ashore may perceive spot towards may direct chance making land ere goes pieces 
sail still lessened ship head brought round parallel coast 
dragon labored tremendously sea struck full beam every wave flooded low waist 
sea struck lifted bodily leeward every foot sailed forward driven one towards coast 
three miles distant another hour would ensure destruction none hoped anchors even find bottom could hold instant teeth gale 
every eye directed towards shore break could seen wall rock rose almost perpendicularly water 
fear hopeless edmund said egbert strongest swimmer would dashed pieces instant rocks 
would indeed egbert replied 
wish boldly engaged four danish ships 
far better would us died fighting england decks perished 
time passed slowly 
every minute dragon swept nearer nearer towards rocks 
make headland master sailor said 
round best turn head rocks 
cliffs rise sheer water moment strikes last us rocks places piled high foot cliffs may possibly manage leap forecastle strikes clamber 
scarce word spoken board dragon came abreast headland 
hundred yards away 
roar seas struck base sounded high din storm 
great sheets foam thrown vast height turmoil water reflux waves great dragon tossed upon like cock boat man grasp shroud bulwark retain footing 
suddenly cheer burst end end ship 
beyond headland great gap visible quarter mile wide cliffs rent sunder tremendous convulsion fiord seen stretching away bosom hills far eye could reach 
dragon head turned soon flying wind inlet 
mile farther fiord widened lake two miles across steep hills clothed foot summit trees 
course winding soon sheltered gale gliding quietly comparatively tranquil water 
ten miles anchor let go sheltered inlet edmund summoned whole crew return thanks god marvellous escape 
dragon suffered severely conflict elements large sails split blown away bulwarks waist shattered considerable damage done gear fittings 
four twenty hours allowed men rest labors hands set work refit 
next morning edmund said kinsman take two men go ashore hunt wild boar deer forests would glad fresh meat 
careful edmund remember country enemies without doubt land blown norway although see signs habitations may well villages somewhere among hills 
careful edmund said laughing return two days set sail without 
like discover abode northern jarl would indeed grand retaliation give taste sufferings inflicted upon us 
would good work egbert said nevertheless present anxious sea 
two days sufficient refit edmund said spread wings 
good bye egbert back sunset hope deer two 
selecting couple followers skilled bow armed spears edmund leapt ashore water deep rocks dragon moored alongside convenience taking board wood repairs 
although board dragon guessed many eyes watching 
small fishing village lay edge fiord mile two beyond inlet ship moored 
hidden among trees huts noticed saxons strange ship seen village fishermen pronounced whencesoever might come assuredly northman ship 
messengers immediately sent villages among hills 
widely scattered day ship arrival force collected deemed sufficient attack 
already edmund leapt ashore norsemen making way quietly forest towards dragon 
edmund advanced hundred yards hillside large party norsemen suddenly sprang upon 
two saxon arrows flew true marks danes rushed upon 
far words spoken edmund placed lips whistle gave orders board ship blew long shrill note shouted top voice danes danes push instant afterwards attacked 
men fought bravely seconds latter cut edmund levelled ground tremendous blow club 
minute later din battle rose water side edmund whistle shout heard saxons shore sprang board seized spears bows danes poured trees 
time saxons defended ship desperate attempts danes gain footing seeing number assailants certain edmund killed captured egbert ordered ropes cut dragon thrust away rocks 
oars got rowed bow shot shore 
egbert held consultation leading men among saxons 
board filled grief loss young leader felt nothing could done would courting danger remain longer fiord 
since large force collected forest news might sent ports moment might see fleet northmen galleys barring retreat therefore bitter grief lamentation dragon sails hoisted made way sea 
consolation egbert said brave lad killed may yet find way back england 
ready wit full invention possibly extricate strait assuredly fear fell first onslaught 
brave lad even moment peril thought first us 
timely warning taken unawares many must killed even dragon escaped capture 
storm entirely abated waters sparkled brightly cold january sun dragon sailed two headlands sea 
different feelings crew animated two days passed channel every heart beat joy thankfulness deepest depression grief reigned board 
edmund adored followers 
kindness ealdorman skill bravery leader cheerfulness brightness every danger peril immensely endeared hearts man felt sustained irretrievable loss chief spirit animated dragon directed enterprises gone 
egbert valiant warrior admirable second enterprising leader altogether without initiative except excited danger dull silent 
although esteemed honored strength bravery felt would poor substitute indeed leader lost 
chapter ix prisoner edmund recovered senses found carried along rough litter forest 
little time realized position recalled circumstances attack 
dragon moved safely fiord assailants returned spot attacked three saxons landed 
two without life found third habiliments evidently higher rank judged although still youth commander saxon party stunned blow club felled 
resolved carry jarl district would assuredly wish learn meaning coming strange ship 
dragon saxon vessel northmen sure 
many expeditions across seas knew saxons dress manner wearing hair ship unlike anything seen seemed things strange understood england completely conquered saxon warships entering northern fiord 
many hours edmund carried forest 
wondered whether would slain arrival kept slave norse saxon tongues similar perfectly able understand language captors 
party twelve men accompanied four bore litter relieved intervals others 
hours feeling giddiness weakness passed men stopping change bearers expressed readiness walk 
hitherto lain eyes closed thought better remain felt perfectly able keep captors journey might aught knew long one 
northmen expressed satisfaction finding burden need longer carried throwing aside boughs formed litter proceeded way 
asked many questions concerning dragon 
answered readily enough evaded place built port sailed 
late afternoon arrived abode jarl bijorn 
rough abode constructed timber thatched rushes yet northmen scarcely settled people tribes part wandering forests hunting engaged warlike expeditions loved things 
leaders dwelt anything like permanent abodes rest raising huts boughs places might make stay 
one edmund conductors gone ahead party approached building bijorn came house meet 
like almost northmen man great stature immense strength 
fifty years passed head still prime life northmen owing life constant activity development muscles childhood existence passed open air retained strength vigor great age 
assiduous training rapidly figures develop consequence age fifteen young northman received arms regarded man although marry many years afterwards early wedlock strongly discouraged among 
bijorn side stood son though twenty two years old rivalled stature muscular development although lacking great width shoulder jarl 
edmund approached war horse jarl fastened post close entrance house neighed loudly 
bijorn looked surprised 
neighing horse among northmen regarded happiest auguries sacred groves horses tied neighing animals considered infallible proof propitious answer would given gods prayer petitioner sought aid 
thor bijorn exclaimed good war horse welcomes stranger 
said anon sweyn intended offer sacrifice odin gods thus declared welcome must needs change intentions 
young saxon asked edmund brought whence come war ship people found upon coasts edmund young man said steadily ealdorman king alfred west saxons 
ship seen coast mine built attack northmen harry coasts 
chase four ships storm arose blew us hither 
speak boldly jarl said one hands foes 
old twenty two edmund replied 
age sweyn 
stand side side let compare 
ay went lacks nigh three inches height bigger across shoulders stalwart young champion indeed brave credit rearing 
west saxons shown worthy foemen handled us roughly last year testify pointed scar sword cut across face 
doubtless son saxon earl last summer inflicted heavy losses upon us

inhabitants country seen danes burned every house within many miles paris peasants would assuredly paid special attention party danes whenever saw dreaded marauders even distance forsook homes fled forests 
party therefore rode eastward nightfall picketed horses lit fire made supper store provisions brought lay sleep night 
daybreak started continued journey necessary halt give horses rest 
passed several parties danes great numbers siege paris given journeying towards burgundy 
slight greeting passed one occasion horseman rode one bands entered conversation two danes rode head party

turning horse rode back comrades party continued way 
avoided towns large danish encampments way made inquiries small parties met party sweyn 
learned without difficulty place encamped days arriving neighborhood found place deserted could tell direction northmen traveled 
chapter xvi freda days edmund party scoured country round journeying one direction another without hearing ought sweyn party 
certainly gone along track main body danes followed question whether turned rather south order cross mountain ranges rhine turned north journeyed great forest ardennes rivers run north sea 
latter respects likely course chosen 
taking sweyn would avoid altogether track majority countrymen taking would naturally object 
siegbert many powerful friends carrying jarl daughter side wounded father would regarded grave offence sweyn might well wish keep clear countrymen forced freda become wife 
even would safe long time return country 
striking ardennes would come upon scheldt moselle maas rivers flowing north sea direct rhine 
edmund knew nothing streams danes said several rivers situated sailed 
took rise knew would probably beyond forest ardennes 
way search edmund said 
come upon river doubtless set work build galleys carry sea three hundred men sweyn venture march land country lately suffered heavily hands danes 
take month six weeks cut trees build ships therefore may hope find ready embark 
first push forest side question inhabitants concerning position nearest rivers divide parties go search appointing place rendezvous may rejoin 
hardly shall fail find taken way 
entering forest obtained considerable store provisions idea extent time spend hunting game 
forest ardennes time immense size extending verdun metz south liege aix north 
men present day would found impossible find way would speedily lost trackless recesses saxons danes accustomed travel forests knew signs well red skins hunters american forests 
therefore felt hesitation entering forest without guide 
danger might beset different kind 
immense numbers inhabitants france champagne burgundy taken refuge forests driving flocks herds 
lived wild life hoping emperor would ere long clear country invaders 
mercy could expected edmund party fell number fugitives 
would time tell story would attacked party plundering danes 
knowing horses would encumbrance forest sold last party northmen encountered entering pursued way foot 
greatest caution observed every sound marked call human voice low cattle bleating sheep turned course avoid encounter inhabitants forest 
lit fires night scarce word spoken march 
several times take refuge thickets heard sound approaching voices needed knowledge woodcraft maintain direction steadily towards north 
last six days journey issued open country beyond forest soon arrived cottage 
peasant struck terror astonishment appearance seven danes could difficulty made understand object neither plunder murder wished information situation direction various rivers country 
learning knew edmund arrived conclusion sweyn would probably attempt descend either branch moselle rhine right one maas left place emerged forest 
edmund decided strike maas follow course forest taking one danes two saxons send others search banks tributary moselle 
starting sent peasant nearest village purchase garments country whole party 
already told man danes saxons bitter enemies northmen aiding defense paris 
peasant doubt edmund told conduct visitors opposed heard doings danes well believed could belong nation 
away hours returned required dresses 
put laying aside helmets shields two parties started danes alone carrying former garments 
next day edmund arrived river followed course upwards sweyn party would building ships forest 
proceeded many miles heard sound axes 
edmund gave exclamation delight 
almost certain hit upon sweyn track unlikely inhabitants country would gone far forest timber 
moved greatest caution approached place whence sound proceeded edmund halted two saxons bade conceal 
dane resumed garments put helmet shield taking advantage every clump undergrowth moving greatest caution edmund made way forward 
presently came within sight animated scene 
large number trees felled banks river three hundred northmen busily work 
frames two great galleys already set engaged chopping planks sides 
two huts erected middle clearing 
one large sweyn banner floated spear 
stood close much smaller edmund doubted appropriated freda 
nothing could done object far attained retiring joined two saxons made way along river bank till reached edge forest 
one saxons sent peasant hut remain return party bring spot edmund chosen encampment 
heart large clump underwood extending river 
brushwood thick entered difficulty passer would dream party hidden within 
near stream edmund companions swords soon cleared away circle boughs constructed arbor 
thin screen bushes separated river could see water none could pass unperceived 
saxon charged bring return considerable supply provisions would dangerous wander woods pursuit game 
northmen edmund noticed cattle would sure hunting woods would wish save cattle provision voyage 
nightfall hut completed journeyed far many days edmund determined postpone attempt discover passing sweyn camp following evening 
day passed quietly towards evening edmund dane started sweyn camp 
approached saw many fires burning shouting singing norsemen rang forest 
waited fires burnt somewhat could see many danes stretching 
edmund companion proceeded camp 
anxious edmund learn restrained impatience safer northman go alone 
dull light dying fires features would unnoticed tongue would betray spoken 
siegbert commended crafty ready fellow edmund felt would able gather information could 
place concealment kept eyes fixed northman figure 
presently saw enter clearing sauntering slowly across throw near fire party danes still sitting talking 
one one lay last done northman rose quietly stole forest

lady freda supposed captive little hut

sworn sweyn slay attempts use violence force marriage doubt keep word 
however believe grow tired last finds hope whatever rescue 
ships built long sea voyage sweyn going lead join viking hasting mediterranean promised men plunder countries ten times richer france england 
long expedition view may well think lady freda resolution soon give way may come see position wife bold viking thousand times preferable captive 
many men loudly express wonder would refuse love valiant warrior sweyn 
news good bad 
edmund fear freda resolution giving way long time news sweyn intended carry upon distant expedition troubled 
course possible might intercept dragon mouth maas uncertain whether ship would arrive mouth rhine time brought round northmen descended 
length voyage would depend entirely wind 
favourable reached mouth seine week would carry destination 
unfavourable saying long voyage would last 
risk great edmund determined make effort rouse country danes fall upon encampment task would knew hard one dread danes great large towns resistance ever offered 
however determined try northmen succeeded getting sea pursuit would indeed long one many weeks even months might elapse could come 
following day rest party arrived leaving forest edmund proceeded country visiting every village endeavoring rouse people attack danes news dreaded marauders near excited terror 
assurances edmund much rich plunder camp would become property destroyed excited feeble interest 
point narrative excited contentment news danes building ships going make way sea 
heaven name let go cry would interfere flight savage beast going river scarcely land scatter plunder country would mad indeed would seek disposed let us alone 
finding efforts vain country near forest edmund went river town liege stood banks 
became known band northmen upper river likely pass alarm spread quickly town council principal inhabitants summoned 
edmund told story suggested fighting men town march river fall upon danes camp 
two days march northmen unsuspicious danger taken surprise may easily defeated 
proposition however received absolute derision 
must mad propose thing young saxon saxon indeed aught know may northman sent draw us ambush 
prepare coming 
man walls stand defensive say three hundred defend successfully may hope seeing strength prepared coming northmen pass without molesting us moving outside walls would worse folly even think thing 
rebuff edmund concluded could hope assistance inhabitants country must depend upon dragon alone 
despatched two men dane saxon orders journey rapidly possible rendezvous dragon found mouth rhine beg egbert move round speed maas

long low waist evidently built great speed 
edmund think intended sail except perhaps occasionally wind favourable aid rowers 
would carry hundred fifty men thirty seats sixty would row 
fine galleys dane whispered 
sweyn good eye boat

unfortunate edmund said companion 
sweyn galleys row faster go oars alone though may know dragon sure one ships 
must hope may attack us 
day passed without sight galleys late afternoon seen distance 
dragon moored near middle rivet 
oars stowed away crews ordered keep bulwarks hopes danes seeing men taking easy prize might attack 
approached within half mile danish galleys suddenly ceased rowing 
strange looking vessel sweyn asked northmen standing round 
know one said twice seen cost 
first time chased us hotly mouth thames destroying several vessels sailing convoy 
next time battle king alfred defeated us last year nearly water

edmund saxons viewed consternation approach sea fog 
instant enveloped ship oars got rowed direction danish vessels hoped would drop anchor fog reached 
word spoken board dragon 
edmund egbert siegbert stood forecastle intently listening sound would betray position danes sound heard 
calculated already reached spot dane anchored left far away astern loud call woman voice heard

dragon head turned rowed rapidly direction voice 
sound heard 
presently sudden shock threw everyone deck 
dragon run high low muddy bank river 
tide falling although minutes crew tried desperately push soon found efforts vain tide rose high nine hours later dragon floated 
morning broke nothing could done even matters mended fog still dense 
disappointment edmund siegbert escape danes extreme 
plans well laid found dragon arrived time doubts entertained success enterprise foiled freda seemed within reach terrible disappointment 
consolation edmund said paced deck impatiently side side egbert fog delays us also hinder danes 
may may egbert answered 
evident board danish ships must recognized us anxious escape rather fight 
draw little water would afraid sandbanks mouth river seeing even strike jump lighten boats push well sea probable may get clearer weather siegbert tells fog often lies thick mouths rivers clear enough open sea 
tide began run edmund determined risks proceed sea 
moorings cast shore dragon suffered drift 
men poles took stations bows sounded continually stern two anchors prepared readiness drop moment notice 
several times water shoaled much edmund point giving orders drop anchors time deepened

much lighter river still misty could see hundred yards round vessel 
change took place night edmund excited anxious sleep previous night lay rest ordering woke change took place weather

anchors got oars manned ship head turned towards shore 
two hours rowing took within short distance land keeping mile rowed west 
men knowing anxious leader overtake danish galleys rowed hardest relieving turns half oars constantly going 
without intermission rowed night set cast anchor 
wind came third day ahead instead helping dragon greatly impeded progress 
far seen nothing galleys mortification knowing spite efforts probably gaining ground upon every day 
even without wind galleys would row faster dragon fully manned would able keep oars going wind advantage would increased greatly lying low water would offer little resistance would able make way brisk pace dragon could scarce move 
saxon ship calais breeze sprang increased progress became slower slower edmund held consultation companions determined run across channel lie mouth thames till wind turned 
long continued blow would lag farther farther behind chase might moreover enter rivers search shelter provisions escape pursuers altogether 
siegbert never mediterranean talked many danes
