meantime emir fakredeen prey contending emotions 
tancred first instant exercised susceptible temperament magnetic influence strangely subject 
heart wilderness person victim young emir suddenly recognized heroic character vaguely seemed vainly attempted realize 
appearance courage tancred thoughtful repose manner high bearing amid distressful circumstances involved large views words escaped preceding evening would intimate took public transactions completely captivated fakredeen seemed length found friend often sighed steadfast commanding spirit whose control felt conscious often required quick whimsical temperament 
relation stand longed press heart go forth conquer world would bear contemplation 
arming maronites became quite secondary object comparison obtaining friendship tancred 
would involved conspiracy yet conspiracy tancred might never met 
impossible grapple question circumstances must watched new combination formed extricate present perplexed position 
fakredeen sent one attendants morning offer tancred horses guest custom englishmen care explore neighbouring ruins celebrated tancred wound kept confined tent 
emir begged permission pay visit lasted quarter hour fakredeen established divan nargileh never quitted 
would difficult tancred found interesting companion impossible made acquaintance singularly unreserved 
frankness startling 
tancred experience self revelations jumble sublime aspirations equivocal conduct total disregard means complicated plots fertility perplexed tenebrous intrigue animated manner picturesque phrase communicated heightened interest effect 
fakredeen sketched character sentence knew instantly individual described without personal knowledge 
unlike orientals general gestures vivid words 
acted interviews achieved adventures 
voice could take every tone countenance every form 
midst bursts plaintive melancholy sometimes anguish sensibility exquisite alternating devilish mockery fatal absence self respect 
appears said tancred young emir declared star accursed since ceaseless exertions years still distant ever accomplishment purpose appears system essentially erroneous 
believe anything great ever effected management 
intrigue seem adept might service court exclusive senate free nation require something vigorous simple 
system intrigue europe quite old fashioned 
one superstitions left us wretched eighteenth century period aristocracy rampant throughout christendom consequences faith god man grandeur purpose nobility thought beauty sentiment withered shrivelled 
dexterous management individuals base dull means success 
live different age popular sympathies however imperfect appeal must recur high primeval practice address nations heroes prophets legislators antiquity 
wish free country make syrians nation done sending secret envoys paris london cities perhaps doomed fall must act like moses mahomet 
forget religions said fakredeen 
many religions deal 
fellows christians moslemin jews pagans grant something might effected cross crescent ark old stone anything would would plant highest range center country would carry damascus aleppo one campaign debarred immense support could preach nationality hate worse almost turks would inviting nationality without race plea like smoke nargileh fragrant puff 
well remains personal influence ancient family vast possessions traditionary power mere personal influence maintained management stigmatise intrigue dexterous member shehaab family long run prince lebanon 
wish prince lebanon dare say may succeed said tancred perhaps much less pains present give 
becomes great plans hour ago conquer east establish independence oriental races ah exclaimed fakredeen sigh ideas worth live 
world never conquered intrigue conquered faith 
see faith anything 
faith said fakredeen musingly ear caught word first time faith grand idea 
one could faith something conquer world see said tancred unusual animation find charm conquering world establish dynasty dynasty like everything else wears indeed last long things precipitate tendency decay 
reasons dwell 
one conquer world enthrone man idea ideas exist ever 
idea touchstone philosophy amid wreck creeds crash empires french revolutions english reforms catholicism agony protestantism convulsions discordant europe demands keynote none sound 
asia decay europe confusion 
repose may death life anarchy

young emir threw earnest glance companion whose countenance though grave calm 
faith said fakredeen inquiringly 
passive faith said tancred 
know deity revealed intervals different ages present purpose feel ignorant therefore active faith know reduced mere spiritual slothfulness resolved struggle fearful necessity embarked great pilgrimage strangely brought us together 
sacred books consult said fakredeen 
sacred books jehovah conferred solomon still greater number sacred books jehovah inspired prophets sacred writings yet voluminous creator ordained human edification completely new series inspired literature 
nearly two thousand years passed since last works appeared 
greater interval elapsed writings malachi writings matthew

far terminating coming direct communication god man appearance herald relation creator creatures fine permanent express 
inspiring consoling influence paraclete commenced ascension divine son 
fact perhaps may found sufficient reason written expression celestial subsequently appeared 
instead foreclosing desire express communication would contrary circumstance authorise
