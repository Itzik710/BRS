stopped abruptly snapping teeth together grasping arm vise 
hard upon words followed rattling clangor great anchor let go horribly intermingled metallic roar came us fearful inarticulate shrieking chill one heart 
anchor plunged water harbor shrieking ceased 
smith turned face tragic light arc lamp swung hard

petrie poor fool hiding chainlocker little hand stole mine 
turned quickly 
karamaneh stood beside
