alan study looked length rexton valley head manse situated thought eden might looked innocence orchards abloom distant hills tremulous aerial springtime gauzes pale purple pearl 
garden despite beauty element tameness domesticity alan eyes moment delighted gazing strayed wistfully north hills broke away long sloping lowland pine fir 
beyond stretched wide expanse lake flashing molten gold crimson evening 
lure irresistible 
alan born bred beside faraway sea love strong heart strong knew must go back sometime 
meanwhile great lake mimicking sea vast expanse storms often swept comfort solace 
often could stole away wild lonely shore leaving snug bounds cultivated home lands behind something like sense relief 
lake primitive wilderness man naught man made doctrines place 
one might walk hand hand nature come close god 
many alan best sermons written come home rapt eyed long shore tramp wilderness opened heart pines called soft sibilant speech 
half guilty glance futile sermon took hat went 
sun cool spring evening swinging low lake turned unfrequented deep rutted road leading shore 
two miles lake half way alan came another road branched struck pines northeasterly direction 
sometimes wondered led never explored 
sudden whim turned 
even rougher lonelier ruts grasses grew long thickly sometimes pine boughs met overhead trees broke away reveal wonderful glimpses gleaming water purple islets dark feathery coasts 
still road seemed lead nowhere alan half repenting impulse led choose suddenly came shadow pines found gazing sight amazed 
small peninsula running lake terminating long sandy point 
beyond glorious sweep sunset water 
peninsula seemed barren sandy covered part scrub firs spruces narrow road wound astonishing feature landscape gray weather beaten house built almost extremity point shadowed western light thick plantation tall pines behind 
house puzzled alan 
never known house near lake shore never heard mention made yet one one evidently occupied slender spiral smoke curling upward chilly spring air 
could fisherman dwelling large built quaint tasteful design 
longer alan looked wonder grew 
people living bounds congregation 
never seen heard sauntered slowly road saw led directly house ended yard 
turned narrow path shore 
far house scanned observantly went past 
barrens swept almost door front side sheltered lake winds pines garden fine show gay tulips golden daffodils 
living creature visible spite blossoming geraniums muslin curtains windows homely spiral smoke place lonely almost untenanted look 
alan reached shore found much open less rocky nature part used frequent 
beach sand scrub barrens dwindled almost insensibly 
right left fir fringed points ran lake shaping little cove house curve 
alan walked slowly towards left headland intending follow shore around road 
passed point stopped short astonishment 
second surprise mystery evening confronted 
little distance away girl standing girl turned startled face unexpected appearance 
alan douglas thought knew girls rexton lithe glorious creature stranger 
stood hand head huge tawny collie dog another dog sitting haunches beside 
tall great braid shining chestnut hair showing ruddy burnished tints sunlight struck hanging shoulder 
plain dark dress wore emphasized grace strength supple form 
face oval pale straight black brows finely cut crimson mouth face whose beauty bore indefinable stamp race breeding mingled wild sweetness flower growing lonely inaccessible place 
none rexton girls looked like 
name amazing could thought crossed alan mind girl turned air indifference might seemed slightly overdone calmer observer young minister moment gesture command dogs walked quickly away scrub spruces 
tall uncovered head visible followed winding footpath alan stood like man rooted ground saw enter gray house 
went homeward maze thought sermons doctrinal otherwise moment knocked head 
beautiful woman ever saw thought 
possible lived rexton six months never heard house well daresay simple explanation 
place may unoccupied lately probably summer residence people recently come 
ask mrs danby 
know anybody 
good woman knows everything everybody rexton three generations back 
alan found isabel king housekeeper got home 
greeting tinged slight constraint 
vain man could help knowing isabel looked upon favor much professional interest 
isabel showed sufficient distinctness 
moreover felt certain personal dislike hard insistent beauty seemed harder insistent ever contrasted recollection girl lake shore 
isabel trick coming manse plausible errands mrs danby lingering dark alan courtesy bound see home 
ruse little patent amused alan although carefully hid amusement treated isabel fine unvarying deference mother engrained womanhood deference flattered isabel even annoyed sense barrier could break pass 
daughter richest man rexton inclined give airs account alan gentle indifference always brought home unwelcome feeling inferiority 
tiring tramping lake shore suppose said mrs danby kept house three bachelor ministers consequently felt entitled hector somewhat maternal fashion 
tiring resting refreshing rather smiled alan 
tired went feel like strong man rejoicing run race 
way mrs danby lives quaint old house away shore never knew existence 
alan way quite indifferent tried make 
isabel king leaning back posingly among cushions lounge sat quickly asked question 
dear mean say never heard captain anthony captain anthony oliver said mrs danby 
lives four winds call daughter old cousin 
isabel king bent forward brown eyes alan face 
see lynde oliver asked suppressed eagerness 
alan ignored question perhaps hear

funny heard mentioned 
people talk much captain old story course never go anywhere even church

eighteen years ago captain anthony came goodness knows bought four winds point built house 
said sailor life live away water

girl always lived father 
must perfect heathen 
never goes anywhere used talk strangers visiting queer sort characters came lake vessels american side 
heard reports past years though since wife disappeared 
keeps yacht goes sailing sometimes cruises weeks ever 
know much olivers mr douglas 
alan listened gossipy narrative interest escape isabel king observant eyes 
much mentally dismissed improbable surmise basic facts probably mrs danby reported 
known girl shore could commonplace primly nurtured young woman 
effort ever made bring people touch church asked absently 
bless yes 
every minister ever rexton try 
old cousin met every one door told nobody home 
mr strong persistent like beaten 
went finally captain sent word wanted parsons pill dosers send till thank mind business 
say mr strong met lynde along shore wanted know come church laughed face told knew god ever would 
perhaps story true 
maybe provoked saying 
mr strong overly tactful 
believe judging poor girl charitably possible making allowances seeing brought 
expect know behave 
somehow alan resented mrs danby charity 
sense humor strongly developed smiled think commonplace old lady making allowances splendid bit femininity seen shore 
plump barnyard fowl might well talked making allowances seagull alan walked home isabel king silent went together long dark sweet smelling country road bordered white orchards 
isabel put construction absent replies remarks presently asked think lynde oliver handsome question gave alan annoyance proportion significance 
felt instinctive reluctance discuss lynde oliver isabel king 
saw moment said coldly impressed beautiful woman 
tell queer stories maybe true said isabel unable keep sneer malice voice 
moment alan secret contempt crystallized pronounced aversion 
made reply went rest way silence 
gate isabel said see us lately mr douglas 
congregation large one visit people often might wish alan answered coldly personal note tone 
minister time know 
shall going see olivers asked isabel bluntly 
considered question 
good night miss king 
way back manse alan consider question 
make attempt establish friendly relations residents four winds surprised find much wanted finally concluded would 
adherents church believe even minister right force upon people plainly wished let alone 
got home although late went study began work new text elder trewin seemed utterly question 
even new one get well 
last exasperation leaned back chair 
stop thinking four winds people let put haunting thoughts words see lay 
girl beautiful face cold one 
would like see lighted warmth soul set free yes frankly would 
looked upon indifference 
would like see welcome friend conviction would although doubt everybody congregation would look upon unsuitable friend 
believe wild unwomanly heathenish mrs danby says emphatically 
believe lady truest sense much abused word though doubtless unconventional 
said see said 
going write sermon 
alan wrote putting thought lynde oliver sternly mind time 
notion falling love 
knew nothing love imagined counted nothing life 
admitted curiosity aflame girl never occurred meant could mean anything attractive enigma solved would lose attraction 
young women knew rexton whose simple pleasant friendship valued placid domestic charm sweet breathed windless orchards 
lynde oliver fascination lake shore wild remote untamed lure wilderness primitive 
nothing personal thought yet recalled isabel king sneer felt almost personal resentment 
following fortnight alan made many trips shore always went branch road four winds point 
attempt conceal hoped meet lynde oliver 
unsuccessful 
sometimes saw distance along shore always disappeared soon seen 
occasionally crossed point saw working garden never went near house feeling right spy way 
soon became convinced avoided purposely conviction piqued 
felt odd masterful desire meet face face make look 
sometimes called fool vowed would go four winds shore 
yet inevitably went 
find shore comfort inspiration formerly found 
something come soul soul wilderness something recognize formulate nameless haunting longing shaped memory cold sweet face starry indifferent eyes gray lake dawn 
captain anthony never got even glimpse saw old cousin several times going coming yard environs 
finally one day met coming path led spring firry hollow 
carrying two heavy pails water alan asked permission help 
half expected repulse tall grim old woman rather stern forbidding look gazing moment somewhat scrutinizing manner said briefly may like 
alan took pails followed path wide enough two 
strode rapid vigorous pace came yard house 
alan felt heart beating foolishly 
would see lynde oliver would may carry water old woman said pointing little outhouse near pines 
washing spring water softer well water 
thank alan set pails bench young bringing water far tires 
lynde always brings home 
stood narrow doorway blocking exit looked keen deep set dark eyes 
spite withered aspect wrinkled face uncomely old woman dignity carriage manner pleased alan 
occur wonder please 
hunted feeling might surprised discover origin curious gratification thought woman lived lynde certain refinement 
preferred unsmiling dourness vulgar garrulity 
young minister rexton asked bluntly 
yes 
thought 
lynde said seen shore 
well cast uncertain glance shoulder house much obliged 
alan idea thought saying turned aside busying pails seemed nothing go 
wait moment

course gossipped know 
yes know grimly care say captain 
queer pair queer make us 
believe like us believe word say lynde 
sweet good beautiful 
fault never went church father hold 
fierce yet repressed energy tone prevented alan feeling amusement simple defense lynde 
moreover sounded unreasonably sweet ears 
promised suppose would matter much miss oliver 
strike young lady would worry much people opinions 
object prolong conversation lynde disappointed old woman turned abruptly work though alan lingered moments longer took notice 
gone peered stealthily door lost sight among pines 
well looking man muttered 
wish lynde home 
dare ask house knew anthony one moods 
time something done 
woman grown life 
nobody anything able even knew 
wonder hates men 
perhaps never knew real gentlemen 
man minister makes wide gulf another way 
seen love man woman bridge wider gulfs though 
lynde fearing 
bitter mere speaking love marriage 
think 
sure mother anthony happy together ever seen marriage 
thought told meeting young man shore something look never noticed found something never known 
never make friends captain queer stopped abruptly tall lithe figure coming shore 
lynde waved hand drew near 
oh emily splendid sail 
glorious 
bad emily carrying water 
tell never away 
young minister rexton met brought 
nice lynde 
lynde brow darkened 
turned walked away house without word 
way home night alan met isabel king main shore road 
carried armful pine boughs said wanted needles cushion 
yet thought came alan mind spying although tried dismiss unworthy continued lurk 
week avoided shore came day inexplicable lure drew irresistibly 
warm windy evening air sweet resinous lake misty blue 
sign life four winds shore seemed lonely virgin human foot never trodden 
captain yacht gone little harbor generally anchored though every flutter wind scrub firs made alan heart beat expectantly saw nothing lynde oliver 
point turning homeward unreasoning sense disappointment one lynde dogs broke hedge spruces barking loudly 
alan looked lynde follow speedily saw something unusual dog behavior 
animal circled around still barking excitedly ran short distance stopped barked returned repeating maneuver 
plain wanted alan follow occurred young minister dog mistress must danger kind 
instantly set dog final sharp bark satisfaction sprang low bank spruces 
alan followed across peninsula along shore rapidly grew steep high 
half mile cliffs rocky precipitous beach beneath heaped huge boulders 
alan followed dog along one narrow paths barrens abounded nearly mile four winds 
animal halted ran edge cliff barked 
ugly looking place portion soil evidently broken away recently alan stepped cautiously brink looked 
could repress exclamation dismay alarm 
feet lynde oliver lying mass mossy soil apparently verge slipping sloping shelf rock sheer drop thirty feet cruel boulders 
extreme danger position manifest glance soil lay stationary yet seemed slightest motion part would send brink 
lynde lay movelessly face white fear appeal visible large dilated eyes 
yet quite calm faint smile crossed pale lips saw man dog 
good faithful pat bring help said

alan common sense told said nothing else much hated leave alone thus realized must lose time

every flying step haunted thought girl lying brink precipice fear might slip could rescue 
reached scene accident dreaded look broken edge lying safely smiled saw brave smile softened tense white face likeness frightened child drop rope strong enough hold earth goes draw slope hand hand asked alan anxiously 
yes answered fearlessly 
alan passed one end rope braced firmly hold tree near enough assistance 
next moment full weight body swung first movement soil beneath slipped away 
alan heart sickened went could cling rope drew saw still safe sloping shelf 
carefully painfully drew knees dinging rope crept rock hand hand 
came within reach grasped arms lifted safety beside 
thank god said whiter lips 
moments lynde sat silent sod exhausted fright exertion dog fawned ecstasy joy 
finally looked alan anxious face eyes met 
something physical reaction suddenly flushed girl cheeks 
sprang lithely feet 
walk back home alan asked 
oh yes right 
foolish get predicament 
father emily went lake yacht afternoon started ramble 
came saw junebells growing right ledge crept gather

pat told go help knew one home horribly afraid concluded another shiver 
never afraid life least kind fear 
terrible experience narrow escape said alan lamely

much larger share mine said alan smiling 
pat come would known danger 
magnificent fellow agreed proudly 
laddie dog 
went father today 
love dogs people 
looked little defiance eyes 
suppose think terrible 
think many dogs much lovable worthy love many people said alan laughing 
childlike ways trace defiance like child expected scolded wrong attitude mind 
yet moments looked tall proud queen 
sometimes path grew narrow walked hand dog head 
alan liked since left free watch admiringly swinging grace step white curves neck beneath thick braid hair today wound head 
dropped back beside wider spaces could stolen glances profile delicately strongly cut virginal soft curves childlike purity 
looked around caught glance flushed something strange exultant stirred alan heart 
maiden blush involuntary unconscious admission power power hitherto unfettered spirit never felt 
cold indifference seen face first meeting gone something told gone forever 
came sight four winds saw two people walking road harbor steps brought face face captain anthony oliver old housekeeper 
captain appearance fresh surprise alan 
expected meet rough burly sailor loud voice forbidding manner 
instead captain anthony tall well built man perhaps fifty 
face beneath shock iron gray hair handsome wore somewhat forbidding expression something apart line feature please alan 
time analyze impression lynde said hurriedly father mr douglas 
done great service 
briefly explained accident finished captain turned alan held hand frank smile replacing rather suspicious contemptuous scowl previously overshadowed 
much obliged mr douglas said cordially 
must come house let thank leisure 
rule partial cloth may heard 
case man minister invite 
front door four winds opened directly wide low ceilinged living room furnished simplicity good taste 
leaving two men lynde old cousin vanished alan found talking freely captain could appeared talk well many subjects far removed four winds 
evidently clever self educated man somewhat opinionated given sarcasm never made references past life experiences alan discovered surprisingly well read politics science 
sometimes pauses conversation alan found older man looking furtive way like captain improvement led expect inclined critical 
least honestly thought 
suspect man lynde father wished think well possible 
presently lynde came 
changed outdoor dress stained moss soil fall soft clinging garment pale yellow material long thick braid hair hung shoulder 
sat mutely dim corner took part conversation except answer briefly remarks alan addressed 
emily came lighted lamp table 
grim unsmiling ever yet cast look satisfaction alan passed 
one dog lay lynde feet sat haunches side laid head lap 
rexton quiet round parish duties seemed thousands miles away alan wondered little dream 
went away captain invited back

respect beliefs whatever may shall expect respect mine captain oliver 
oh insult god said captain faint sneer 
alan went home tumult contending feelings 
altogether like captain anthony clear yet something man attracted 
intellectually worthy foeman alan often longed since coming rexton 
missed keen stimulating debates college days seemed chance renewing eager grasp 
lynde beautiful though shared unlikely father lack belief could essentially irreligious impossible true woman 
might opportunity help lead dearer light alan douglas sincere man well others yet motives lie first inception deep even probe self analysis 
yet faintest suspicion real source interest lynde oliver sudden forceful desire use service rescue spiritual peril day rescued bodily danger 
must lonely unsatisfying life thought

seldom spoke past life alan fancied avoided personal reference 
said abruptly never ask go church always afraid would

one evening went four winds found door open seeing captain living room stepped unannounced 
captain anthony sitting table head hands alan entrance turned upon haggard face blackened furious scowl beneath blazed eyes full malevolence

alan felt unpleasant impression much understand might never understand although understanding necessary perfect friendship 
never spoken freely past life yet felt somehow something kept back jealous repression 
must something connected father alan thought 
doubtless captain anthony past would bear inspection daughter knew dwelt shadow knowledge 
heart filled aching pity raged secretly powerless help 
girlhood blighted robbed meed happiness joy 
likewise miss womanhood alan hands clenched involuntarily unuttered question 
way home evening met isabel king

surprised worried 
apparent difference captain anthony continued suave friendly 
alan always enjoyed conversations captain witty incisive pungent yet disliked man every visit 
compelled define impression would said captain charming scoundrel

discovery amazed shock 
reason love woo win wife cared 
good sweet true 
anything doubt antecedents could touch 
probably world would look upon captain anthony somewhat undesirable father law minister aspect question disturb alan 
trouble letter felt sure would easily able clear away 
probably malicious busybody become aware frequent calls four winds chose interfere private affairs thus 
first time occurred certain lack cordiality among people late 
really doubtless reason 
time would moment 
thoughts wholly taken lynde estrangement part attach much importance anything else 
thought mattered incalculably alan people rexton put together thought 
right like man woo woman choice would certainly brook outside interference matter 
sleepless night went back four winds morning 
lynde would expect time would chance finding 
result justified idea met spring 
alan felt shocked change appearance

lips pallid hollow circles eyes made appear unnaturally large 
last left girl bloom youth found woman life laid heavy hand 
burning flood color swept face met receded quickly leaving whiter 
without waste words alan plunged abruptly subject 
miss oliver avoided late done anything offend spoke word hurt eyes persistently cast

love dear loved ever since met want wife

turned eyes full upon hint maidenly shyness shrinking 
instead full blank incredulous horror swallowed every feeling 
mistaking expression struck icy chill alan heart 
certainly expected ready response part knew even cared might find matter time win avowal certainly expected see evident abject dismay blanched face betrayed 
put hand warding blow 
gasped

please go away forget forget alan said smiling little spite suffering 
woman ever love give unless

alan stared least comprehending meaning words 
everything pain hope fear passion slipped away moment stunned physical blow 
could heard aright 
married said dully 
lynde mean yes 
married three years ago 
told alan voice stern although mean shrank shivered 
began low monotonous tone feeling sort seemed utterly faded 
three years ago mother ill ill shock would kill doctor father brought lake told us 
man young sea captain came see father 
name frank harmon known father well past 
sailed together 
father seemed afraid never seen afraid anybody 
could think much anybody except mother knew quite like captain harmon although polite suppose might called handsome 
one day father came told must marry captain harmon

white drawn 
implored marry captain harmon 
said would mean shame disgrace us captain harmon hold would tell knew marry

score wild questions rushed lips crushed back lynde sake held hand 
good bye dear said almost steadily daring say lest say much 
good bye lynde answered faintly 
gone flung moss spring lay utter abandonment misery desolation 
pain indignation struggled mastery alan stormy soul walked homeward 
captain anthony doings sacrificed daughter crime dubious past 
alan never dreamed blaming lynde kept marriage secret put blame belonged captain shoulders 
captain anthony never warned much hint lynde free 
probably seemed good joke 
alan thought furtive amusement often detected captain eyes explained 
found elder trewin study got home 
good elder face stern anxious called distasteful errand tell young minister scandal intimacy four winds people making congregation remonstrate concerning 
alan listened absently none resentment would felt interference day previously 
man mind pin prick limb wrenched away 
promise objectionable calls four winds cease said sarcastically elder finished 
elder trewin got away feeling snubbed relieved 
took purty quiet reflected 
believe much yarns 
isabel king started probably exaggerated lot 
suppose notion like bringing captain church 
foolish never manage meanwhile giving occasion gossip 
well stop 
good pastor works hard hard mebbe 
looked real careworn worried today 
rexton gossip soon ceased cessation young minister visits four winds 
month later suffered brief revival tall grim faced old woman recognized captain anthony housekeeper seen walk rexton road enter manse 
stay long watchers dozen different windows agreed upon nobody even mrs danby best find ever knew called 
emily looked alan grim reproach shown study soon alone began usual abruptness mr douglas given coming four winds alan flinched

autumn dragged away 
alan found much man may suffer yet go living working 
work made life possible flung feverish energy growing thin hollow eyed even elder trewin remonstrated suggested vacation suggestion alan merely smiled 
vacation would take away lynde neighborhood thought entertained 
never saw lynde never went part shore yet hungered constantly sight sound voice glance luminous eyes 
pictured eating heart solitude four winds clenched hands despair 
possibility harmon return alan could never face moment 
thrust ugly presence thoughts put away desperately 
man dead fickle fancy veered elsewhere 
nothing else could explain absence 
could never know uncertainty would forever stand lynde like spectre 
thought lynde pain 
would elected bear suffering could freed nightmare dread harmon returning claim 
dread always hung must intensified agony love another man 
could nothing nothing 
groaned aloud helplessness 
one evening late november alan flung aside pen yielded impulse urged lake shore 
mean seek lynde would go part shore would likelihood meeting 
get away must 
november storm raging would certain satisfaction breasting buffets fighting way 
besides knew isabel king house dreaded meeting 
since conviction written letter lynde could tolerate girl tasked self control keep showing contempt openly 
perhaps isabel felt beneath outward courtesy 
least seek society formerly done 
second day storm wild northeast gale blowing cold rain freezing sleet fell frequent showers

alan beckoned man jump overboard swim ashore enforcing appeal gestures commanded haste next shower come 
moments seemed seaman understand lacked courage power obey 
next minute dropped rigging crest mighty wave borne onward shore 
speedily backwater reached man sucked swirl wave threw arms disappeared
