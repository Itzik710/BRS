among servants knew diamonds house last night mr shipman asked detective 
one say replied jeweller though perhaps parlourmaid whilst waiting table may heard mr knopf discussing bargain 
would object searching servants boxes certainly 
would object either sure 
perfectly honest 
searching servants belongings invariably useless proceeding added man corner shrug shoulders 
one even latter day domestic would fool enough keep stolen property house 
however usual farce gone less protest part mr shipman servants usual result

one significant fact connection case tended still excite curiosity public time still bewilder police later fact mentioned chipps evidence 
knife namely charles lavender stabbed remember left wound produced court 
little hesitation chipps identified property master lord arthur skelmerton 
wonder jury absolutely refused bring verdict george higgins really beyond lord arthur skelmerton testimony one particle evidence whilst day wore witness witness called suspicion ripened minds present murderer could lord arthur skelmerton

mr buchanan prosecuted treasury certainly indictment terrific 
according one decision could arrived namely accused dock moment passion perhaps fear killed blackmailer threatened disclosures might ever ruined socially committed deed fearing consequences probably realizing patrolling constables might catch sight retreating figure availed george higgins presence spot loudly accuse murder

colonel mcintosh ra first 
present bachelors party given lord arthur night murder 
evidence tended first corroborate chipps footman regard lord arthur orders show visitor library counter order soon wife came room 
think strange colonel asked mr buchanan lord arthur suddenly changed mind seeing visitor well exactly strange said colonel fine manly soldierly figure looked curiously element witness box 
think rare occurrence racing men certain acquaintances would wish wives know anything 
strike lord arthur skelmerton reason wishing wife know particular visitor presence house think gave matter slightest serious consideration colonel guarded reply 
mr buchanan press point allowed witness conclude statements

sir marmaduke speech clever extreme 
bit bit demolished tower strength case accused basing defense entirely upon evidence lord arthur skelmerton guests night 

lord arthur playing cards quarter hour later police scene murder committed 
meanwhile colonel mcintosh evidence proved conclusively accused sitting smoking cigar 
obvious therefore clear daylight concluded great lawyer client entitled full discharge nay thought police careful harrowed public feeling arresting high born gentleman insufficient evidence brought forward 
question knife remained certainly sir marmaduke passed guarded eloquence placing strange question category inexplicable coincidences tend puzzle ablest detectives cause commit unpardonable blunders present one 
footman may mistaken 
pattern knife exclusive one behalf client flatly denied ever belonged 
well continued man corner chuckle peculiar moments excitement noble prisoner discharged 
perhaps would invidious say left court without stain character daresay know experience crime known york mystery never satisfactorily cleared 
many people shook heads dubiously remembered charles lavender killed knife one witness sworn belonged lord arthur others reverted original theory george higgins murderer james terry concocted story lavender attempt blackmail lord arthur murder committed sole purpose robbery 
may police far able collect sufficient evidence higgins terry crime classed press public alike category called impenetrable mysteries 
chapter ix broken hearted woman man corner called another glass milk drank slowly resumed lord arthur lives mostly abroad said 
poor suffering wife died day liberated magistrate

least colonel mcintosh unimpeachable witness prove could committed murder yet added slow excited emphasis marking sentence knot yet deliberately tries throw guilt upon man obviously also innocent 
may thought guilty 
wished shield cover retreat one knew guilty 
understand 
think someone said excitedly someone whose desire would great lord arthur silence scandal round gentleman name 
someone unknown perhaps lord arthur overheard conversation george higgins related police magistrate someone whilst chipps taking lavender card master minutes time wherein make assignation lavender promising money doubt exchange compromising bills 
surely mean gasped polly 
point number one interrupted quietly utterly missed police

even well grant said excitedly 
great important point oddly enough prosecution never moment took consideration 
chipps footman first told lavender lord arthur could see bookmaker terribly put chipps goes speak master minutes elapse footman tells lavender lordship see latter says well seems treat matter complete indifference 
obviously therefore something must happened alter bookmaker frame mind 
well happened think evidence see one thing occurred interval namely lady arthur advent room

brief interval must realized man persistent therefore living danger husband 
remember women done strange things far greater puzzle student human nature sterner less complex sex ever 
argued police argued along lord arthur deliberately accuse innocent man murder shield guilty one remember lady arthur may discovered man george higgins may caught sight time make good retreat 
attention well us constables diverted 
lord arthur acted blind impulse saving wife cost 
may met colonel mcintosh argued polly 
perhaps said 
knows gallant colonel swear friend innocence 
could conscience duty accomplished 
innocent man suffering guilty

mr campbell clerk quite ready swear interview concerning diamond earrings lady whose identity accused perfectly convinced casual observer question time even day interview took place could make little difference ultimate issue 
took moment entire drift sir james fenwick defense edith crawford 
mr macfarlane left witness box second victim eminent advocate caustic tongue could read book whole history crime investigation mistakes made police first public prosecutor afterwards 
sir james fenwick knew course placed finger upon one demolishing like child blows upon house cards entire scaffolding erected prosecution

accused stated declaration time wrote mr david graham breaking engagement heard nothing edinburgh tragedy 
london papers reported crime briefly 
accused busy shopping knew nothing mr david graham altered position 
case breaking engagement proof accused obtained possession jewels foul deed 
course impossible continued man corner apologetically give idea eminent advocate eloquence masterful logic

may result remarkable trial verdict non proven 
jury absent forty minutes appears mind every one remained spite sir james arguments firmly rooted conviction call instinct like edith crawford done away lady donaldson order become possessed jewels spite pompous jeweller many contradictions offered diamonds sale 
enough proof convict given benefit doubt 
heard english people argue england would hanged 
personally doubt 
think english jury judicial loophole non proven would bound acquit

bad police 
lady donaldson robbed murdered immediately argue robbed murdered person 
argued polly

see simple 
edith crawford wears diamonds one night brings back lady donaldson room

mean lady donaldson could see whether edith crawford put back jewels since asked question 
argue never argue interrupted excitedly state undeniable facts 
edith crawford wanted steal jewels took opportunity 
world waited lady donaldson bed tremlett maid gone 
next day namely th tries dispose pair earrings mr campbell fails decides go london better chance 
sir james fenwick think desirable bring forward witnesses prove since ascertained fact namely th october three days arrest miss crawford crossed belgium came back london next day 
belgium doubt lady donaldson diamonds taken settings calmly repose moment money derived sale safely deposited belgian bank 
murdered lady donaldson gasped polly 
guess queried blandly 
placed case clearly enough seems simple 
daring brutal murder remember 
think one thief would nevertheless strongest motives shield thief consequences misdeed aye power since would absolutely illogical nay impossible accomplice 
surely think curious nature warped morally well physically know natures feel thousand times strongly even straight natures everyday life 
think nature brought face face awful problem 
think nature would hesitate moment committing crime save loved one consequences deed mind assert moment david graham intention murdering lady donaldson 
tremlett tells seems strangely upset goes room finds discovered robbed 
naturally suspects edith crawford recollects incidents night probably expresses feelings david graham threatens immediate prosecution scandal 
repeat dare say wish kill 
probably merely threatened 
medical gentleman spoke sudden heart failure doubt right 
imagine david graham remorse horror fears 
empty safe probably first object suggested grim tableau robbery murder arranges order ensure safety 
remember one thing miscreant seen enter leave house surreptitiously murderer left signs entrance none exit 
armed burglar would left trace one would heard something 
locked unlocked lady donaldson door night lay dead one house tell one left trace one could suspicion one killed without apparently slightest premeditation without slightest motive

ever seen oranmore court character worthy dickens 
pronounced brogue fat podgy clean shaven face always immaculately clean large hands often delighted caricaturist 
soon transpired memorable magisterial inquiry relied verdict favor client upon two main points concentrated skill upon making two points telling possibly could 
first point question time john neill cross examined oranmore stated without hesitation given mr percival eleven clock morning

polly replied forgotten particulars connected curious murder fully remembered stir flutter caused certain section london society

persons implicated murder directly indirectly type commonly called society men men town whilst harewood club hanover square round centred scandal connection murder one smartest clubs london 
probably doings harewood club essentially gambling club would ever remained officially absent knowledge police authorities murder regent park revelations came light connection

february th foggy night nevertheless mr aaron cohen park square west two clock morning finally pocketed heavy winnings swept green table harewood club started walk home alone 
hour later inhabitants park square west aroused peaceful slumbers sounds violent altercation road

fog 
soon however appearance inspector detective medical officer quickly informed tragedy put end discussion 
bell rung servants four women asked look body 
amidst tears horror screams fright recognized murdered man master mr aaron cohen 
therefore conveyed room pending coroner inquest 
police pretty difficult task admit indications go first literally clue 
inquest revealed practically nothing 
little known neighborhood mr aaron cohen affairs 
female servants even know name whereabouts various clubs frequented 
office throgmorton street went business every day 
dined home sometimes friends dinner 
alone invariably went club stayed small hours morning 
night murder gone nine clock 
last servants seen 
regard revolver four servants swore positively never seen unless mr cohen bought day belong master 
beyond trace whatever murderer found morning crime couple keys linked together short metal chain found close gate opposite end square immediately faced portland place 
proved firstly mr cohen latch key secondly gate key square 
therefore presumed murderer accomplished fell design ransacked victim pockets found keys made good escape slipping square cutting tunnel gate 
took precaution carry keys threw away disappeared fog 
jury returned verdict wilful murder person persons unknown police put mettle discover unknown daring murderer 
result investigations conducted marvellous skill mr william fisher led week crime sensational arrest one london smartest young bucks 
case mr fisher got accused briefly amounted night february th soon midnight play began run high harewood club hanover square 
mr aaron cohen held bank roulette twenty thirty friends mostly young fellows wits plenty money 
bank winning heavily appears third consecutive night mr aaron cohen gone home richer several hundreds start play 
young john ashley son worthy county gentleman mfh somewhere midlands losing heavily case also appears third consecutive night fortune turned face 
remember continued man corner tell details facts giving combined evidence several witnesses took many days collect classify 
appears young mr ashley though popular society generally believed vulgarly termed low water eyes debt mortally afraid dad whose younger son one occasion threatened ship australia l note pocket made extravagant calls upon paternal indulgence 
also evident john ashley many companions worthy mfh held purse strings tight grip 
young man bitten desire cut smart figure circles moved often recourse varying fortunes smiled upon across green tables harewood club 
may general consensus opinion club young ashley changed last pony sat turn roulette aaron cohen particular night february th 
appears friends conspicuous among mr walter hatherell tried best dissuade pitting luck cohen unprecedented run good fortune 
young ashley heated wine exasperated bad luck would listen one tossed one l note another board borrowed would lend played parole 
finally half past one morning run nineteen red young man found without penny pockets owing debt gambling debt debt honor l mr aaron cohen 
must render much maligned gentleman justice persistently denied press public alike positively asserted present mr cohen repeatedly tried induce young mr ashley give playing 
delicate position matter winner twice taunt risen young man lips accusing holder bank wish retire competence break luck 
mr aaron cohen smoking best havanas finally shrugged shoulders said please half past one enough player always lost never paid never could pay mr cohen probably believed 
therefore hour refused accept mr john ashley promissory stakes longer 
heated words ensued quickly checked management ever alert avoid least suspicion scandal 
meanwhile mr hatherell great good sense persuaded young ashley leave club temptations go home possible bed 
friendship two young men well known society consisted chiefly appears walter hatherell willing companion helpmeet john ashley mad extravagant pranks 
night latter apparently tardily sobered terrible heavy losses allowed led away friend scene disasters 
twenty minutes two 
situation becomes interesting continued man corner nervous way 
wonder police interrogated least dozen witnesses quite satisfied every statement conclusively proved 
walter hatherell ten minutes absence say ten minutes two returned club room 
reply several inquiries said parted friend corner new bond street since seemed anxious alone ashley said would take turn piccadilly going home thought walk would good 
two clock thereabouts mr aaron cohen satisfied evening work gave position bank pocketing heavy winnings started homeward walk mr walter hatherell left club half hour later 
three clock precisely cries murder report fire arms heard park square west mr aaron cohen found strangled outside garden railings 
chapter xxix motive first sight murder regent park appeared police public one silly clumsy crimes obviously work novice absolutely purposeless seeing could inevitably lead perpetrators without difficulty gallows 
see motive established 
seek crime benefits say french confreres 
something 
constable james funnell beat turned portland place park crescent minutes heard clock holy trinity church marylebone strike half past two 
fog moment perhaps quite dense later morning policeman saw two gentlemen overcoats top hats leaning arm arm railings square close gate 
could course distinguish faces fog heard one saying question time mr cohen 
know father pay money lose nothing waiting 
apparently made reply constable passed returned spot walked beat two gentlemen gone later near gate two keys referred inquest found 
another interesting fact added man corner one sarcastic smiles polly could quite explain finding revolver upon scene crime 
revolver shown mr ashley valet sworn property master 
facts made course remarkable far quite unbroken chain circumstantial evidence mr john ashley 
wonder therefore police thoroughly satisfied mr fisher work applied warrant young man arrested rooms clarges street exactly week committal crime 
matter fact know experience invariably taught murderer seems particularly foolish clumsy proofs seem particularly damning time police guarded pitfalls 
case john ashley indeed committed murder regent park manner suggested police would criminal senses one idiocy kind mind worse many crimes 
prosecution brought witnesses triumphal array one another 
members harewood club seen prisoner excited condition heavy gambling losses mr aaron cohen mr hatherell spite friendship ashley bound admit parted corner bond street twenty minutes two seen till return home five came evidence arthur chipps john ashley valet 
proved sensational character 
deposed night question master came home ten minutes two 
chipps yet gone bed 
five minutes later mr ashley went telling valet sit 
chipps could say time either young gentlemen come home 
short visit home presumably fetch revolver thought important mr john ashley friends felt case practically hopeless 
valet evidence james funnell constable overheard conversation near park railings certainly two damning proofs accused

quiet placid court addressed words solicitor 
listened gravely occasional shrug shoulders recital crime police reconstructed excited horrified audience 
mr john ashley driven madness frenzy terrible financial difficulties first gone home search weapon waylaid mr aaron cohen somewhere gentleman way home 
young man begged delay 
mr cohen perhaps obdurate ashley followed importunities almost door 
seeing creditor determined last cut short painful interview seized unfortunate man unguarded moment behind strangled fearing dastardly work fully accomplished shot twice already dead body missing times sheer nervous excitement 
murderer must emptied victim pockets finding key garden thought would safe way evading capture cutting across squares tunnel distant gate faced portland place 
loss revolver one unforeseen accidents retributive providence places path miscreant delivering act folly hands human justice 
mr john ashley however appear least bit impressed recital crime

little demur mr cohen accepted loan revolver came found actual scene crime finally parted mr cohen minutes heard church clock striking quarter three 
oxford street end great portland street five minutes three takes least ten minutes walk ashton club 
explanation credible mind question revolver never satisfactorily explained prosecution 
man effectually strangled victim would discharge two shots revolver apparently purpose rousing attention nearest passer 
far likely mr cohen shot perhaps wildly air suddenly attacked behind 
mr ashley explanation therefore plausible possible one 
understand therefore nearly half hour examination magistrate police public alike pleased proclaim accused left court without stain upon character
