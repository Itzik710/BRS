although grown little thinner suffer severity climate 
besides expected dangers rejoiced almost saw winter approaching 
see said one day johnson see flocks birds flying south fly cry adieu yes dr clawbonny answered johnson something told time go

timid fellows doctor bird man ought try birds supply food must support elsewhere 
sailors good deck feet ought go end world 
hope hatteras succeed projects succeed doctor 
agree johnson even one faithful man accompanies two us yes johnson doctor answered pressing brave sailor hand

says report open sea northwest stretched far eye could reach 
hatteras gazed emotion portion charts large white space marked unknown regions eyes always returned open polar sea 
many statements said accounts stewart penny belcher doubt impossible bold sailors saw eyes doubt word yet sea closed early winter discoveries made intervals several years sea exists shall find shall see illustration hatteras went upon quarter deck 
dense mist enveloped forward deck one could hardly see top mast 
nevertheless hatteras ordered ice master took place wanted make use first break fog look horizon northwest 
shandon took occasion say second mate well wall open sea right shandon answered wall six weeks coal bunkers 
doctor invent scientific way continued shandon heating us without fuel 
heard making ice fire perhaps make fire ice 
shandon returned cabin shrugging shoulders 
next day august th fog lifted minutes 
deck saw hatteras lofty perch gazing intently towards horizon came without saying word ordered set sail easy see hopes deceived 
forward heaved anchor resumed uncertain path northward 
wearisome main topsail fore topsail yards lowered rigging masts also lowered longer possible place reliance varying wind moreover winding nature passes made almost useless large white masses gathering sea like spots oil indicated approaching thaw soon wind began slacken sea began freeze wind arose young ice would break disperse 
towards evening thermometer fell 
brig arrived end closed pass rushed full steam opposing obstacle 
sometimes thought fairly stopped unexpected motion ice streams would open new passage would plunge boldly stoppages steam would escape safety valves fall deck form snow 
another obstacle progress brig ice would get caught screw hard engine could break necessary reverse engines turn brig back send men free snow axes levers hence arose many difficulties fatigues delays 
went way thirteen days forward advanced slowly penny strait
