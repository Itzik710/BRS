chapter ii 
father said cuthbert harrington tastes differed widely 
cuthbert essentially londoner friends would difficulty picturing engaged country pursuits 
indeed cuthbert hartington scarlet coat toiling turnip field heavy boots gun shoulder would absurd anomaly 
lacked strength contrary tall well loosely built 
grace common manly attribute possessed eminent degree 
careless ease manner unconscious picturesqueness poses turn would smacked haughtiness slightest element pride disposition curve neck well poised head 
life chiefly passed among artists like class affected loose easy attire 
wore turn collars carelessly knotted necktie velvet jacket 
one men intimates declared capable anything chose chose nothing 
never distinguished way harrow 
maintained fair place forms moved school done rather natural ability study 
never eleven although general opinion would certainly place chosen play regularly 
sauntered harrow sauntered cambridge keeping enough chapels lectures avoid getting trouble passing examinations without actual discredit rowing little playing cricket fit seized preferring take life easily avoid toil either mental bodily 
nevertheless read great deal general subjects one best informed men college 
spent good deal time sketching painting art one passion 
sketches admiration friends although best lessons could obtain university lacked application industry convert sketches finished paintings 
vacations spent chiefly continent life home bored immensely week among swiss lakes galleries munich dresden worth pleasures country life could give 
went home short time leaving university stay productive pleasure neither father 
single taste common though cuthbert made effort take interest field sports farming long father told evident life altogether distasteful tastes lay another direction perfectly ready make allowance would enable either travel live chambers london 
sorry course lad said could make happy blame matter natural disposition 
course come sometimes rate shall happier knowing living life enjoying way seeing trying vain take pursuits would derive pleasure whatever 
awfully sorry father cuthbert said 
heartily wish otherwise would rather live london almost starvation income settle 
really tried hard get like things

generally accompanied sketching expeditions normandy brittany spain algiers portfolios subject mingled admiration anger among artist friends st john wood admiration vigor talent sketches displayed anger content nothing greater 
days largely spent studios seated comfortable chair could find would smoke lazily watch work criticise freely 
men grumbled laughed presumption ready acknowledge justice criticism 
excellent eye color effect contrast light shade whose pictures hung often ready enough admit canvas owed much charm happy suggestion cuthbert often ready part 
every two three months went home fortnight 
greatly attached father one drawback contentment life unable carry squire wishes settle fairclose 
would occasionally bemoan friends 
bad prodigal son would say except get deserve neither feed husks tend swine though fatted calf would ready return bring 
know prodigal wilson one oldest set would grumble reply know lazy young beggar wasting time opportunities thousand pities born silver spoon mouth 
father ought turned adrift allowance sufficient kept bread butter left provide everything else would artist sir would made big name 
would occasion waste time painting pot boilers could devoted good honest serious work us 
obliged consider sell please public turning call pretty pictures children playing dogs trumpery things sort 
bah sickening see young fellow wasting life 
cuthbert laughed good temperedly accustomed tirades indeed singularly sweet easy temper

imagine sensation authors artists would critics state opinions absolute candor think better mr hartington case would fewer idiotic books written fewer men wasting lives trying vainly produce good paintings 
true enough cuthbert laughed must remember critics buy either books paintings plenty people buy idiotic books perfectly content pictures without particle artistic merit 
suppose admitted reluctantly much worse causes mediocrity us mediocre authors like dickens thackeray george eliot exception artists like millais landseer books paintings give pleasure fulfil purpose purpose afford livelihood make suppose mr hartington fulfil ought purpose course elevate mind improve taste

work goud school went steadily intervals turns franc tireurs des coles going beyond walls 
indeed goud acknowledged work better usual 
certainly studio never merrier full life 
far active exercise rough work entailed constant vigilance necessary long night watches diminishing interest young fellows work studio seemed invigorate painted inflamed determination make lost time

cuthbert heartily enjoyed change prevailing tone like accustomed studios st john wood somewhat strict discipline prevailed studio enjoyed hard work excitement outside walls 
fact running risks sharing work added bond union among students although met frequently lodgings less uproarious fun healthier atmosphere pleasant earnest talk

field evinced want spirit upon contrary always ready volunteer men required crawl forward night ascertain precise position prussian outposts endeavor find meaning stir movement might heard towards front 
times fits moodiness seemed increase 
seldom present gatherings companions went work studio generally late night returned rooms 
cuthbert felt american avoided opportunities conversation alone 
replied cordially enough greeting met longer dropped smoke pipe apartments formerly done 
cuthbert great difficulty guessing reasons change relations 
first noticed arnold taking first place minette spoken half jestingly half seriously subject 
never made secret distrust model early days intercourse spoken freely arnold subject 
could understand american appeared become really attached would shrink risk expostulations course adopted 
cuthbert believed comrade present state indecision although deeply love yet able bring idea taking minette back wife home louisiana 
would sheer madness said yet doubt end must know piece stupendous folly understand reluctance risk speaking subject 
awfully sorry know one cases gone far would worse useless try interfere would make bent upon going 
see one anything trust chapter accidents 
minette dazzled might prospect marrying gentleman man property might still hesitate would entail leave paris live abroad 
doubt fond dampierre may change mind 
may killed business 
may decide return america directly siege ends idea coming fetch afterwards either may get infatuation return may find one else supplanted affections 
fancy constancy would one strong points rate see good meddling matter though dampierre spoke certainly express opinion frankly 
much best things go us 
hot headed beggar probabilities strong favor serious quarrel subject ever broached us 
one evening cuthbert taken book return studio sat reading long past usual dinner hour went 
passed several badly lighted streets way restaurant palais royal intended dine 
people evening wet 
vaguely conscious one going direction heard footsteps following short distance behind 
one worst lighted silent streets steps suddenly quickened 
cuthbert turned sharply round

cuthbert felt rather saw knife hand struck straight shoulder face fellow act striking received blow 
fell shot knife flying hand clattering pavement several yards away 
cuthbert stood moment prepared strike man rose made movement turned heel walked 
would serve right give scoundrel charge attempted murder said would give end bother 
would worth trouble pretty well punished 
cut knuckles imagine comes find minus teeth

arnold made allusion subject days meeting cuthbert door house said way hartington reason believe right blow luckily escaped meant 
however think recurrence matter fact may say sure right dampierre

marched small cluster houses relieved two companies line duty night 
first time specific post assigned men high spirits considered honor 
authorities treated franc tireurs valueless real fighting useful certain extent harassing enemies outposts counted upon regular work omitted altogether orders assigning positions occupied

almost unroofed others yawning holes walls work shell prussian field guns pitted scars bullets side facing enemy 
scarce pane glass remained intact

hundred yards left battery six guns another mound four five hundred yards right

ten clock cuthbert went half company belonged relieve comrades last three hours front line 
little time duty pierre leroux charge half company said des valles commanded whole outposts seems hear deep sound comes pulsations think considerable body men marching 
captain listened bent head short time 
right pierre certainly movement sort going front fancy distance away marching village front hear plainly 
better send three four men right let go distance along attempt creep forward 
prussian sentries thick along facing us men might possibly crawl pretty close outposts farther along thick 
pick four good men dangerous service 
tell get near sentries without observed lie listen attentively 
better chance hearing 
getting men lie perfectly quiet 
take three men go des valles yes like 
stop company return 
lieutenant went along line stopping man ask name

sentries became scattered went along main body posted front village 
last men warned going forward fire returned 
sent last man line communicate outposts furnished corps occupying ground farther right men going reconnoitre 
companions cautiously crawled forward 
rather half way across ground cuthbert uttered exclamation came sudden contact figure advancing similar caution opposite direction 
needed guttural oath german inform enemy 
touching neither could use arms instinctively grappled lay ground 
look leroux got hold german cuthbert said low voice moment antagonist said something effect german 
lieutenant two men leapt feet four five men sprang close front 
fire leroux exclaimed two men discharged pieces shots flashed front darkness none hit moment engaged hand hand fight foes 
meantime cuthbert antagonist rolling locked closely arms

sergeant one germans said low voice retraced steps must somewhere called 
two three minutes search came upon

fire said knew must near one went 
fire heard voice knew lieutenant repeat hartington 
afraid done 
minute later joined 
moment sharp fire broke german lines showing party also returned outposts 
find des valles farther along hartington anything report better go tell afterwards escaped 
quite given 
suppose better go cuthbert said much report except doubt noise heard caused heavy column men marching village 
cuthbert found captain made report 
thank hartington 
pretty well convinced even firing party germans began sound loud enough clearly distinguished 
suppose give guess numbers strong body strong could tell 
hundred prussians marching make much noise five hundred frenchmen even allowing think least one strong battalion perhaps 
case must lookout 
course may fancy mean attack hand may intend push forward 
go colonel ought know think 
along minutes ago noise plain estimate force anything like strong opinion 
cuthbert made report colonel latter went forward des valles outposts giving orders men houses fall ready either advance support front line man barricades houses cover retreat 
reaching outposts sound marching longer heard faint continuous murmur could plainly made intervals fire kept enemy 
think des valles colonel asked listening time 
say sir column broken village men making way front open order 
suggest colonel say would well send men two batteries tell enemy mustering force village opposite us expect attacked also officers commanding troops either side us 
four men despatched ten minutes later batteries almost simultaneously opened fire village

attack houses slackened prussians turned oppose reinforcements come shortly afterwards regiment side also reached scene action commander felt surprise failed prussians retired former position affair 
four companies line left strengthen position enemy try another attack daybreak congratulating colonel franc tireurs vigilance prevented taken surprise sturdy defense made officers line withdrew men positions occupied 
loss franc tireurs small 
volley preceded attack done execution whatever fought shelter lost eight men killed score wounded 
sharpest affair yet engaged old colonel highly pleased result 
outpost resumed former position cuthbert related comrades particulars struggle prussian sergeant 
pretty well matched said suppose equally surprised found grappling dark 
course neither us knew many supporters close hand first thought struck must silence possible comrades came assistance 
afraid able shake free grip get throat fortunately relaxed hold moment felt loosened mine top rest easy 
well got well anyhow hartington pierre said 
see anything man knocked musket occur look like go bring 
good idea hartington probably stunned 
go get leave us 
however turned go call heard front minute later man came 
said recovered consciousness heard tremendous fire going soon could collect thoughts became assured enemy must attacking village 
therefore concluded best thing lie still fire ceased could hear prussians retreating 
crawled close line outposts

chapter x another month great change come paris 
spirit empty gasconnade succeeded one befitting time circumstances 
hopes assistance without lessened spirit resistance grew stronger firmer 
longer talk sweeping prussians france longer article faith paris would saved thought surrender farther ever men minds 
paris would resist last 
would give time france reorganize would set example devotion patience suffering last famine forced surrender world least say paris proved worthy reputation 
defences strengthened enormous extent outlying forts siege began could carried without much difficulty resolute attack rendered practically impregnable approaches thickly mined obstacles sorts erected round casements barracks magazines protected coverings trunks trees great depth earth able defy heaviest shell 
walls enciente repaired greatly strengthened covered bastions works even one forts taken work enemy would begun 
theaters closed first 
caf chantants open air concerts long since followed example partly increasing seriousness temper people partly failure gas 
caf longer crowded midnight dim lights lamps taken place gas gave sombre air establishments eight clock evening put shutters 
national guard reorganized 
battalion three four hundred able bodied part unmarried men order government selected formed companies service field promised short time develop troops equal physique spirit mobiles vastly superior line 
ladies longer appeared streets rich dresses

great numbers devoted services hospitals ambulances spent whole time ministering sick wounded 
yet little real suffering paris privations inconveniences borne uncomplainingly even cheerfully 
beef become almost unobtainable agreed horse flesh bad substitute cats dogs fast disappearing streets flesh prepared variety ways took place cards restaurants hares game change hardly noticed 
cuthbert working hard 
school definitely closed liked free work chose

done day canvas always covered easels placed behind screen corner room doors opened friends 
week two days corps marched take turn outpost work work laid 
regular troops either side occasional exchange shots except one side attempted advance position seldom every post advantage every village strongly fortified defy capture except large force 
germans recognized already paris taken force cost except tremendous expenditure life therefore content close every avenue escape leave famine work

franc tireurs however ever active 
kept increasing fusilade upon prussian outposts night day keeping state perpetual irritation watchfulness

nursing one greatest gifts women woman made nurse devote life championing sex 
mary reply silently moved air deeply offended dignity 
enthusiastic little woman cuthbert laughed quietly anyhow splendid nurse would infinitely rather see female spouter platforms 
fancied siege might effect 
seen something realities life likely give theorizing 
looks older womanly softer good deal

never seen look soft trust imagination 
sure improve 
another fortnight cuthbert bed able walk ward render little services patients 
know mary said one day happened idle standing talking sat edge bed curious thing happened day went sortie 
saw fellow cumming rascal ruined bank bolted know 
moment recall face struck directly afterwards 
saw go house 
grown beard evidently living quiet respected british resident 
capital idea safe would balloon 
intended look got back paris see circumstances prevented 
course get arrested soon siege cuthbert 
glad found 
well know quite made mind 
suppose made great sum 
see companies bolstered bank money smashed time 
suppose intended rob bank time helped 
probably sunk savings thought would pull round aid additional capital 
far could make report men went matter seem drawn money account day bolted took eight ten thousand pounds safe 

think meant hand indeed say anything 
thought would give good fright richly deserves ask questions 
never quite understood dear old dad came buy shares 
inquire far find cumming transferred really like hear said time 
man prove sold know bank going break ill sure persuaded buy knowing ruin would follow would hunt spare pains get punished 
persuaded father buy shares make 
could interest involving smash 
besides intimate terms way 
imagine father would gone advice reference business investments 
course father would turned matters 
long shareholder bought shares two months death makes matter singular 
father say cuthbert girl said short pause 
suppose spoke 
said father heard rumors effect bank good state belief whatever bought shares thinking would good effect upon credit sort county institution felt interest 
father solicitor bank must known something affairs warn danger running asked said attended legal business outside knew nothing affairs 
seems curious affair altogether mary said gravely time work 
chapter xvi 
ambulance mary brander resolutely put conversation cuthbert aside soon started walk home became uppermost thoughts 
certainly curious affair 
time time friends home corresponded sent local newspapers especially case first months stay germany naturally supposed would greatly interested calamity bank failure 
time issued read full report committee investigation upon affairs although passed lightly accounts noticed proceeds sale fairclose estates put subject deduction fifteen thousand pounds previous mortgage jeremiah brander esq 
matter made impression upon mind time came back remembrance 
course perfectly natural mr hartington wished borrow money father solicitor friend would gone 
could nothing unusual cuthbert told mr hartington buying shares two months death certainly singular 
surely father could prevented taking disastrous step 
men regarded members family exactly light considered public jeremiah brander certainly exception 
suavest men eyes fellow townsmen family well aware possessed temper 
girls young conversation always guarded hearing grew longer felt necessity prudence speech frequently indulged criticisms colleagues professed unbounded respect admiration public 
mary often felt something like remorse thought first time read martin chuzzlewit many touches delineation mr pecksniff character reminded father 
believed upright man could help admitting long way man public believed 
subject rarely permitted think 
never got well together acknowledged much fault 
much fact strong bent going way regardless opinion others cause gulf grown dissimilarity character absolute difference view held things general rest family entertained regarding outspoken frankness habit expressing contempt things praised highly 
thinking matter mr hartington purchase bank shares found wondering motive father could permitting buy knowing squire relied upon opinion business matters could doubt latter could prevented disastrous transaction 
must motive felt sure experience amply sufficient well aware never acted without motive sort 
far could see motive apparent way altered opinion 
cuthbert thinks curious affair wonder said 
suppose suspicion anything wrong suppose may call sharp practice 
think cuthbert likes father last man suspect anyone 
horrid fairclose ten times bad 
whole thing disgusting 
wicked think father could possibly anything quite honorable right especially slightest reason suspecting 
suppose know exactly people think makes uneasy 
know well enough never gone away home hated hear running people seemed friendly making fun things seemed interested 
used make quite hateful glad said like go girton get rid go 
well say honor father mother honor doubt worrying nothing help 
dreadful feel like towards one father felt quite chill run cuthbert said go see man cumming try get bottom things 
one thing certain never live fairclose never 
leaves us julia clara may live like let much year go way 
never put foot father mother gone 
miserable think getting hateful girl 
suspecting father done something wrong although least idea without shadow reason almost hating woman man refused loves 
become discouraged thrown plans laid seem easy thought would 
quite true 
much cuthbert laughed 
anyhow nice woman teach women weak weakest 
think ever objectionable sort girl world become 
time arrived conclusion nearly reached home 
sudden feeling could present mood submit petted fussed madame michaud struck turning abruptly walked brisk steps arc de triomphe champs elys es along rue rivoli round boulevards returning home fagged better exertion 
one thing determined walk would give work ambulance 
plenty nurses said one less make difference 
miserably weak rate sense enough know better going every day danger 
belongs someone else would rather die ever dream fool know harder harder gets better talking indifferently 
accordingly next morning went told dr swinburne felt must rate time give nursing 
quite right miss brander said kindly taxed strength much already looking mere shadow two months ago

always take meals home 
second floor door left 
cuthbert went rang bell 
cumming opened door 
looked visitor inquiringly 
remember mr cumming cuthbert said cheerfully 
surprised recovered serious wound 
come sit mind want chat 
name cuthbert hartington man given violent start name mentioned face turned ashy pallor 
hesitated moment cuthbert entered closed door behind silently led way sitting room 
happened see street cuthbert went pleasantly seated 
course beard altered bit could first recall face soon came back 
happy idea shutting chance extradition warrant applied 
however morrow next day little difficulty end 
thought would come conversation naturally course shall take depend good deal results 
may mention went taking revolver pocket laying table thought well bring present feel quite personal tussle 
want talk man asked doggedly 
may tell placed little money got never found beyond sending years nothing gained denouncing 
might satisfaction though seeing man ruined punished least would men 
know would 
would depend upon circumstances 
ready believe transactions brought bank ruin honestly believed companies assisted would turn well things would come right end 
suppose fool run risk ruin penal servitude snug place unless thought indeed directors responsible making advances although course ignorant fact held considerable interest companies nothing actually criminal transactions 
therefore matter making contents safe actually prosecuted 
rate present intention interfering affair remain mr jackson end life care give information desire 
look man face relaxed 
give information desire nothing conceal 
course obtain conviction taking money save trouble pleading guilty 
therefore see could harm way answering questions may choose ask 
want get bottom along mystery father came take shares moment bank shaky 
tell mr hartington 
puzzle 
shares transferred 
money came useful enough knew smash must take place soon possibly might able lay hands much ready cash 
however tell exactly came 
brander lawyer came said client mr hartington wanted fifty shares 
astounded brander knew perfectly well things bad way 
way spoke saw something curious affair put screw much hinted follow instructions would blow whole thing air made objections especially proposed transfer shares 
transfer drawn regular form 
brought duly signed father 
noticed clerks witnessed signature supposed done office 
made point get transfer passed others without attention directors called matter 
got transfer signed sealed two directors talk going things signed without looking names 
far concerned beginning ending matter 
oh another point transfer ante dated three weeks 
course might lying brander office time 
dated day previous board meeting ordinary course would passed next meeting might well remained brander hands knew directors going meet 
often wondered brander game course thought saw bought fairclose 
crafty old fox brander never able understand permitted father ruin 
cuthbert remained silent time 
explanation thickens mystery said 
understand motive 
brander explanation affair father insisted advice buying shares believe rumors discredit bank 
strong county man may know thought people heard taken shares would tend restore confidence concern 
contrary brander seems taken special pains prevent transaction known even directors clear explanation lie reasons wished defeat father intentions 
think must get put statement made paper get sworn public notary least think way 
objection intention continue live known resident feel pretty safe except chance meeting like would rather done somewhere else 
reasonable enough cuthbert agreed 
expect gates open day two shall go england try get bottom matter 
think prussians let englishmen pass 
would mind going far calais get document sworn legal form come back 
would rather go brussels man said 
doubt would best cuthbert agreed 
might well done place france 
well mr cumming secret safe 
call soon find get across brussels 
shall ready whenever mr hartington 
course quite see document perfectly ready sign 
see either 
shall want think matter 
present feel complete fog 
quite understand 
may tell brander puzzled good deal last two three months bank stopped 
spent two three hours going affairs 
knew generally matters stood never gone thoroughly 
done said knew bad way think bad 
want see whether smash could postponed 
things bad lately think improving affairs bolstering might pull round time given 
see much chance 
however say fact wanted hear driving 
went looking list mortgages held course cumming interest hold long possible may mine wishing bank keep doors open little time yet 
would never going market try transfer mortgages clients london would think take 
course taken good care cases bank lend fifty per cent 
full value lands mortgages safe consols 
give fortnight notice anything pressing coming forward think manage get twenty thousand pounds worth mortgages taken hands altogether 
might repeat operation three four times could get done quietly fuss 
way bank could kept going good many months would give time things take turn 
case anything like run taking place think unlikely could let fifteen thousand hours 
standing call could run town bring next train 
make offer puzzled reason wanting prop bank business mine doubt could get fifty sixty thousand pounds worth mortgages taken hands would enable us hold time 
fact get one batch twenty thousand pounds worth transferred month stopped came one morning said sorry tell cumming heard people town relied help us mortgages tell undertaken financing contractor south american railway therefore inclined present sink money farther mortgages afraid far concerned things must take course know take course 
naturally believe brander story evident made offer reason wanting bank keep doors open time reason whatever ceased operate withdrew offer 
see part business bearing upon affair cuthbert said beyond helping show brander playing deep game 
know mr hartington 
however think matter shall opportunities discussing way brussels 
almost wish let matter alone altogether cuthbert said drove back lodgings 
wanted clear seemed mystery find plunged much deeper fog ever 
dimly suspected brander reason permitted father take shares word would dissuaded 
find whole transaction carried something like secrecy far father name used prop bank almost smuggled list shareholders even directors kept ignorance transfer cumming shares 
whole business ugly look though motive secrecy brander willing allow assist father ruin conceive 
worst matter mary father 
yes wish goodness left whole business alone 
cuthbert given address cumming surprise man called evening 
expect see day mr hartington said entered thinking matter fresh light struck felt obliged come round tell 
hope disturbing 
worried confounded business given going friends promised feel could talk indifferent matters 
well mr hartington idea surprise seem incredible almost seems yet works help thinking near mark 
believe father never signed transfer signature fact forgery 
deuce cuthbert exclaimed earth put idea head man idea absurd forgery must done brander possible motive could act pretend say 
could see say certainty absence motive weak point idea 
respects thing works 
first place although father man business singular go way take shares bank must known case things going wrong whole property would involved 
doubt idea must occurred 
certainly astonished beyond measure done thing 
wrote brander hoping sort explanation 
time satisfied gave know matter reflection since seemed extraordinary came try get information 
saw father supposed transaction mr hartington yes fortnight 
mention word habit talk business matters never business matters except estate generally told difficulty rents discussed improvements thought making beyond never question money 
sometimes would say balance bank rather larger usual cuthbert like extra hundred never 
well course negative evidence made allusion purchased shares still habit speaking things might naturally said investing spare cash shares bank 
yes thought would done think would abstained telling might thought would considered rash speculation 
certainly cuthbert said warmly thought criticising anything chose money flying 
well rate may take proof whatever mr hartington aware transaction time visit aware time death 
cuthbert nodded 
let us suppose transfer forgery committed brander course would naturally pursue exactly followed namely get placed register without noticed directors 
men personal friends father knowing extent though admit without realizing peril bank seriously involved might refused register transfer privately remonstrated especially vendor even done one would almost certainly alluded subject first time met 
brander might intended later transfer shares bogus purchaser rate knew father bad health would wanted keep bank putting shutters death 
remark assist way father alive almost immediately death declined support bank farther 
motive imagine given motive supposition appears perfectly feasible 
motive whatever must strong one admit first place running risk detected forgery second must three hundred pounds pocket amount check handed 
check father yes said rents hand therefore paid seemed natural enough 
signatures two clerks may forgeries possibly knowing father signature may signed matter course without actually seeing affix 
admit possible 
seems possible enough cuthbert said motive could brander part could never run risk merely gratify special fancy may fairclose 
certainly mr hartington 
jeremiah brander particle sentiment composition 
course solicitor company made business study man pretty closely came conclusion rank humbug humbug paid one 
quite idea help us slightest towards explanation risk everything nothing whatever gain 
feel difficulty cumming said stroking chin thoughtfully admit beats altogether 
way said suddenly saw official report mortgage fifteen thousand estate 
mind telling came may possibly help us 
least idea 
never heard existence mortgage brander wrote time bought estate gave explanation perfectly satisfied time 
mr cumming looked inquiringly 
explanation cuthbert said pause closed lips altogether subject 
present strange state affairs know need abstain mentioning 
brander explained father said required close matter long troubling 
gathered way put folly woman early years need say respect father memory prevented pursuing matter 
brander said advanced money mortgage order business done privately without third person cognizant 
cumming sat thoughtfully minute without speaking leapt suddenly feet put hand cuthbert shoulder 
take word mr hartington mortgage much bogus affair transfer 
one supplies motive looking 
failure bank brought fairclose market brander purchase ten fifteen thousand value time gained another fifteen thousand bogus mortgage 
motive forgery father name transfer 
believe cuthbert said slowly 
brander could never scoundrel 
besides course men wound affairs bank would look closely mortgage 
whether real whether forgery brander would equally obtained money father death supposition motive fails 
know 
claim made direct would naturally got sharp lawyer investigate would inquired good deal closely official liquidator probably took trouble 
mortgage one knows anything mortgagor death would always looked upon suspicion collateral proofs would required 
course may wrong altogether would well ascertain whether official liquidator take steps obtain evidence 
certainly cuthbert said 
write time bound say answer seemed entirely satisfactory straightforward 
said mr brander given proof draw check amount mortgage day executed although show interest specifically paid checks father receipts found among father papers half yearly payments interest 
seemed settled brander collected rents made accounts 
seems straightforward enough mr hartington long ground suspicion would doubtless pass muster certainly worth inquiring 
cuthbert sat silent time 
whole barest suspicion said 
thread fact transfer kept secret directors doubt brander able give plausible explanation character stands high abchester question raised would scouted atrocious libel upon 
supposing absolute proof see stand 
father shareholder bank creditors course claim whatever property property fact sold proceeds divided long ago go matter lawyers mr hartington imagine would go back creditors bank 
would simply prove bank position give title therefore sale null void 
would argued course gave title suppose signed deeds plea would signature obtained fraud 
sign deeds cuthbert said 
brander pointed received rents profits would better stand altogether proved otherwise death dues would charged upon therefore remained hands executors one gave titles 
whoever gave titles say bank claim whatever property transfer forgery sale would declared void loss would fall purchaser 
would case anyone brander hard would strict accordance justice 
however matter course require best legal opinion consideration 
great difficulty grant see got prove father signature transfer forgery 
first step ascertain whether attesting witnesses actually present father signature affixed 
clear point anyhow cuthbert said go straight brussels england see clerks hear say matter 
present saw father sign transfer end whole affair 
nodded 
would mind wagering hundred pounds one find present 
well soon settled heard afternoon conditions surrender signed morning morrow forts given armistice commence 
case suppose foreigners meet difficulty obtaining passes leave 
well much obliged suggestion made mr cumming though confess little faith indeed anything come present seems would much rather matter remained
