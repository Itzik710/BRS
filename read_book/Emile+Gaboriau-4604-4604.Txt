trivial terribly impressive manner precisely thing daniel told captain people resign face enemy 
evident officers assembled doubted courage discussing fact entered 
clear attributed resignation fear 
idea might suspected cowardice daniel trembled 
could prove coward challenge every one men fight one two ten duels would prove shrunk unknown perils new country dangers armed invasion fatal climate unless willing remain marked man life must go yes go since dangers awaited held afraid

countess observed kind affectionate reserve like well disposed person seen advances repelled hurt quite ready friends first sign 
mrs brian never opened thin lips growl unpleasant remark single word intelligible shocking remained hon 
elgin whose sympathetic pity showed daily clearly 
since maxime warning henrietta avoided anxiously 
thus leading truly wretched life magnificent palace kept prisoner father orders could longer disguise 
felt every moment watched overlooked jealously even seemed forget completely 
great gates formerly almost always open kept carefully closed opened admit carriage concierge mounted guard keeper jail 
little garden gate secured two additional enormous locks whenever henrietta walks garden came near saw one gardeners watch anxious eyes

sarah brandon countess ville handry surrounded strange aristocracy risen upon ruins old paris contraband aristocracy dangerous kind high life unheard extravagance mysterious splendor dazzles multitude puzzles police 
young countess exactly receive people notoriously tainted 
clever commit blunder bestowed sweetest smiles upon equivocal bohemians represent races whose revenues come much less good acres broad sunlight credulity stupidity mankind

besides gone work industriously 
business men called upon marriage already reappeared accompanied legion famished speculators mere report great enterprise attracts like flies settling upon lump sugar 
count shut men study often spent whole afternoon

therefore truly amazed two days afterwards became accidentally witness lively discussion father countess subject famous placards scattered paris france 
countess seemed distressed whole affair presented husband objections henrietta would liked urged authority derived count passionate love

ah take care madam broke poor girl threatening gesture take care patience limits

suddenly great revolution taken place henrietta heart 
said roughly look madam let us explanation alone

oh owe thanks said 
done duty imperfectly 
rather grim manner began tell done nothing comparison meant 
well guessed led henrietta attempt suicide look around room 
swore nothing fear want long 
earnest pressing good man became protestations henrietta drew back within usual reserve mind filled prejudices instilled mrs chevassat 
fortunately clever man old dealer means saying might shock saying much could fail touch gradually regained position 
almost conquered returned letters written making dreadful preparations saw looked unhurt sealed 
thus left half hour diplomatic intercourse obtained poor young girl promise would renew attempt life would explain fatal combination circumstances reduced extreme suffering 
would hesitate said knew easy often little experience arrange difficult matters 
henrietta hesitate 
thought occurred soon found alone brought conclusion papa ravinet really mrs chevassat says bad woman would warned

miss declared believe interrupted saying great solemnity think deceive would meanest least men 
rely upon honor 
firm voice began account life fatal evening father said resolved daughter give second mother 
old dealer taken seat facing henrietta listened fixing eyes upon face enter thoughts anticipate meaning
