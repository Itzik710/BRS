title poor relations author honore de balzac release date july ebook language english character set encoding ascii start project gutenberg ebook poor relations produced dagny john bickers poor relations honore de balzac introduction la cousine bette perhaps last really great thing balzac le cousin pons follows actually written beyond question one greatest works 
written highest possible pressure contrary author usual system parts without even seeing proof constitutionnel autumn winter early spring departure vierzschovnia object secure certain sum ready money clear indebtedness 
sometimes asserted labor coming top many years scarcely less hard works almost last straw broke balzac gigantic strength 
things never possible certain greatness la cousine bette uncertainty 
first place long book balzac think putting aside books like les illusions perdues les celibataires splendeurs et miseres des courtisanes really groups work written different times longest novels except still later rather doubtful petits bourgeois 
second place length obtained length often obtained digressions long retrospective narrations even insertion padding collection business le cousin pons 
whole stuff substance la cousine bette honestly woven novel stuff one piece one tenor texture constant subject subterranean malignity heroine erotomania hulot crevel sufferings adeline pieuvre operations marneffe wife fit work together exactly cogs gear harmonious piece machinery 
even much simpler shorter books le pere goriot means possess seamless unity construction even march shoulder shoulder personages story 
second place story strikes hold reader force less irresistible older simpler stories referred 
compared even companion force grasp remarkable 
absolutely criminal contemptible feel le cousin pons sometimes languishes loses never said history evil destiny partly personified elizabeth fischer hovers house hulot 
believe felt inclined question propriety title book assign true heroineship valerie marneffe also persons fond comparing contemporary becky sharp advantage latter 
place detailed examination comparison shall say think thackeray anything fear 
valerie beyond doubt powerful study strange woman enforcing biblical view personage singular force effectiveness 
methods coarser commonplace becky never could long sustained ordeal tenure house curzon street without losing even equivocal position decent english society must always remembered orders speak lisbeth inspired 
lisbeth hand one class stands alone much becky 
doubt arduous milky veined critics would say doubtfully healthy praiseworthy task depict almost pure wickedness excessively hard render human difficulty increased certainly much lessened artist determination represent malefactress undiscovered even unsuspected throughout 
balzac however surmounted difficulties almost complete success 
advantage doubt considerable one taken shakespeare shakespeare devised iago making mademoiselle fischer person low birth narrow education intellectual faculties narrower still keenness intensity 
largeness brain shakespeare endows human devil largeness heart seem wish us imagine certain circumstances incapable contrast sharply enough peasant meanness lisbeth 
indeed balzac whose seldom erring instinct fixing viler parts human nature may somewhat much dwelt undeniable elsewhere hit fault lower class generally well 
appear hulots though treated without much ceremony gave bette real cause complaint anything conduct corresponding camusots luckless pons 
cousin adeline prettier childhood richer highly placed middle life enough lisbeth incarnation radical hatred superiority kind 
set work ruin degrade unhappy family set variance make miserable best could 
way wonderfully told various characters minor well major muster wonderful strength 
know balzac made quite hector hulot vice fact elsewhere think novelist happy treating particular deadly sin 
man rather disgusting wholly idiotic old fribble rather tragic victim libitina 
also wife angelic 
crevel pattern model vicious bourgeois made fortune wenceslas steinbock pattern model foibles polen aus der polackei hortense better energy hulots loathsome reptile marneffe victoria celestine brazilian though sure rather transpontine rastaqouere rest capital work capitally 
would half fine behind savage pagan naturalism lisbeth fischer angel family black angel indeed 
one last largest balzac great works last accept la cousine bette pendant contrast le cousin pons always united suffrages different classes admirers 
first place disagreeable common euphemism la cousine bette certainly 
second accused berquinade like balzac best moral rag picking apt describe books like le medecin de campagne le lys dans la vallee even like eugenie grandet 
considerable variety interest central figure curiously pathetic attractive even though curse something like folly often attends balzac good characters may little weigh 
would book exceptional charm even anonymous knew author know shakespeare 
happens however le cousin pons attractions 
first place balzac always great perhaps greatest depicting mania passion whether subject pleasure gold hunger parental affection 
pons two manias one interfere rather helps 
would nothing chief mania ruling passion one balzac 
often occasion notice balzac means one great impersonal artists 
many things never best unless personal interests likings hatreds sufferings enjoyments concerned 
kind actor manager comedie humaine perhaps like actor managers took rather disproportionate care parts played 
even desperate collector fancier bibelots speculator one mania nearly responsible pecuniary troubles need overwork certainly gave constant comparatively harmless satisfactions 
connoisseurship would nothing question competence another others 
seems certain balzac frequently bought things probable acquisitions went eyes succession stages charles lamb sort cousin pons way described inimitably 
pictures like john lamb apt begin raphaels end carlo marattis 
balzac like pons even addicted bric brac art proper many vicissitudes madame hanska seem succeeded getting together considerable also miscellaneous unequal collection house rue du paradis contents dispersed part though believe rochschild bought bought many years ago 
pons indeed poor probably queer indulge one fancy balzac think collectors nobler poetic class though number may large 
balzac liked new beautiful things well old beautiful things made 
unwearied customer though uncomplaining one great jeweler froment meurice whose tardiness carrying behests pathetically upbraids one extant letter 
therefore balzac sympathize felt well put pons bric brac matter would appear likewise music though rather less direct evidence 
sympathy resulted addition pons figure schmucke minor parochial figure good much appreciated believe fellow melomanes 
even usual art balzac surrounded two originals humorists ancestors would called figures much much ordinary world 
grasping worldliness parvenue family camusot one degree greed portress madame cibot admirably represented latter particular must always hold high place among balzac greatest successes 
indeed sort companion sketch cousine bette still lower rank life representing diabolical woman perhaps wrong author intentions suspected diane de maufrigneuse claims make trio sphere even lisbeth lisbeth madame cibot 
different opinions held actual bric bracery piece say balzac competence matter artistic value introduction 
perhaps enthusiasm little run away perhaps gives us little much avails freely license least temptation digress introduction persons elie magus affords 
also open one say climax effect climax introduced somewhat soon struggle first body property patroclus pons inordinately spun even granting author mania might utilized better giving us harmless ill treated cousin happy hunts less disputes accumulated quarry 
however means simply old generally rather impertinent suggestion artist shall art something different chosen 
sufficient le cousin pons agreeable book pathetic less grimy companion full author idiosyncracy characteristic genius 
may uninteresting add le cousin pons originally called le deux musiciens le parasite change great improvement due instances madame hanska 
bibliography two divisions les parents pauvres closely connected difficult extricate separate histories 
originally author intended begin le cousin pons bore title les deux musiciens make important two la cousine bette grew hands became one sense leader 
appeared constitutionnel first october th december rd second march th may next year 
winter two published book twelve volumes chlendowski petion 
newspaper balzac received rarely exact detail francs cousine cousin first named thirty eight headed chapter divisions book form became hundred thirty two 
le cousin pons two parts feuilleton thirty one chapters book form became parts seventy eight chapters
