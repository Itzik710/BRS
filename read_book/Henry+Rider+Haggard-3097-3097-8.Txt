cruel fears nicephorus said ambition given cause fear 
general true prince replied 
foolishly aspire rule long ago

go dwell good folk known time time let hear may found need help counsel 
led gates given witnessed copy warrant release bade farewell time making known guards certain priests lingered molested must answer augusta 
thus parted 
handed keys prison walked palace unattended minded take duties unnoticed 

entered palace gate sentry called something messenger seemed waiting departed full speed 
sentry saluting told orders must stand awhile knew 
presently discovered across square within gates marched full general guard whereof officer also saluted prayed come 
went wondering given charge surrounded pompous guard led new quarters splendid could dreamed 
guard left presently officers appeared old comrades asking orders course none give 
also within hour summoned council generals discuss matter war empire engaged 
means conveyed become great man rate one way growing great 
afternoon according old custom making round guards met augusta upon main terrace surrounded number ministers courtiers 
saluted would passed bade one eunuchs call 
came stood 
greet general olaf said 
long oh remember 
state prison governor office relieved request 
well palace welcomes within know safe 
thus spoke great eyes searching face bowed head token dismissal 
saluted began step backwards according rule whereon motioned stand 
began make laugh painted throng 
say nobles ladies said ever see man address best may reason believe understands language yet one word vouchsafe us answer 
stands like soldier cut iron moves springs never thank good day lips 
doubtless would reprove us holds talk much heard man stern morality tenderness human foibles 
way general olaf rumor reached us forsaken doubt become christian 
true true augusta 
pagan man iron christian wonder one hard diamond less 
yet glad tidings good servants church must since henceforth friendship closer value 
general must received publicly bosom faith encouragement others follow example 
perhaps served us well many wars officer guard god mother 
matter shall considered us 
answer nothing replied save augusta considered matter consider answer 
courtiers tittered instead growing angry thought might irene burst laughing 
truly wrong said provoke open mouth general like red sword wear tongue sharp somewhat heavy 
tell us general new quarters taste reply know inspected liking tasks attended furnishment 
tis done see northern style think somewhat cold heavy like sword tongue 
augusta asks said quarters fine single soldier 
two rooms dwelt sufficient 
single soldier well fault remedied 
marry general olaf 
find woman wishes marry wish marry obey augusta commands 
general remember first must approve lady 
venture general share new quarters lady approve 
followed court turned walked away went business wondering meaning guarded half bitter talk 
next event returns clearly public acceptance christian great cathedral st sophia must taken place long meeting upon terrace 
know every means power striven though without avail escape ceremony pointing could publicly received body church chapel priest congregation dozen humble folk 
empress would allow 
reason gave desire conversion proclaimed throughout city pagans thousands might follow example 
yet think another avow 
might made known public man importance pleased honor 
morning rite martina came acquaint details told empress would present cathedral state making progress thither golden chariot drawn famed milk white steeds 
seemed ride chariot general uniform splendid enough followed company guards surrounded chanting priests 
patriarch less person receive converts cathedral would filled great ones constantinople 
asked whether irene intended god mother threatened 
replied martina 
point changed mind 
much better said 
canon church olaf forbids intermarriage god parent god child replied dryly 
whether canon come augusta memory say 
may 
god mother asked hurriedly leaving problem irene motives undiscussed 
written imperial decree delivered hour ago 
martina younger many years yes augusta explained seem good friends talk together much alone doubtless supposed upon matters religion could person suitable good christian fill holy office 
mean martina asked bluntly 
mean olaf replied turning away head speaking strained voice concerned augusta late done honor somewhat jealous 
well god mother one need jealous 
augusta clever woman olaf 
quite understand said 
augusta jealous reason olaf except happens jealous every woman comes near knows intimate trust well perhaps trust 
oh assure late spoken woman fifty unnoted unreported 
many eyes watch olaf 
might find better employment 
tell outright martina meaning surely even wooden headed northman guess olaf glanced round make sure alone great apartment quarters doors shut went almost whisper mistress wondering whether marry whether choose certain somewhat virtuous christian soldier second husband 
yet made mind 
moreover even nothing could done present question struggle son power settled way 
therefore worst best soldier yet single life left say month two 
month two perhaps would wise travel suggested 
perhaps fool would run away fortune could get leave absence case impossible attempt journey without would mean death 
wise soldier bide await events possessing soul patience good christian 
god mother must instruct service 
look troubled really simple 
know stauracius eunuch god father fortunate since although looks doubt jealousy blind murder god son would cause much scandal even constantinople 
special mark grace also bishop barnabas egypt allowed assist ceremony snatched soul burning 
moreover since sacrament administered afterwards commanded attend receive confession chapel palace within hour 
know day feast st michael angels received name michael high one well fitted warlike saint though think shall still call olaf 
farewell god son meet cathedral shall shine reflected light virtues 
sighed laughed little glided away 
due course priest chapel came summon saying bishop barnabas awaited 
went made confession though truth little tell already know 
afterwards good old man quite recovered hurts imprisonment accompanied quarters ate together

eyes caught mine fate us net 
leaned forward gazing gazing soul dark eyes gazed gazed 
great cathedral vanished glittering crowds sound chanting feet marched died ears

lay upon breast heliodore heliodore one wished might wed 
well certainly wished alas could wed irene power toy play break would fare woman known wished wed must secret gone constantinople way could follow 
ever open minded must learn keep counsel 
remembered barnabas said augusta commanded prince magas daughter come palace guests

advanced kneeling kissed augusta hand according custom occasions noting doubtless stauracius also pressed hard enough lips 
rose said thank augusta god father stauracius interrupted 
god father stauracius echoed goodness towards 
yet humility venture say soldier knows nothing whatsoever duties chamberlain master palace therefore beg someone else competent may chosen fill high offices 
hearing words stauracius stared round owl like eyes 
never known officer constantinople wished decline power pay 
scarcely indeed could believe ears 
augusta laughed

rate god father god mother instruct especially god mother 
foolish talk 
stauracius may gone attend affairs speaking see burn take secretaries scratching pens sets teeth edge 
bide moment general master palace duty receive certain guests day wish speak

yes give leave court since thereby may learn secrets laughed merrily 
bowed saying would obey augusta orders best power went olaf would discover truth concerning magas schemes soldier well fitted find 
seems plan recovery egypt hands followers accursed false prophet whose soul dwells satan 
would win back egypt may thereby add glory name empire 
hear proposes study well make report 
afterwards see alone present send letter hand martina bidding open heart 
week shall time spend upon magas must give business upon hangs power perchance life 
words spoke heavily fell fit brooding

doubtless listened eagerly first words heliodore spoke save one cathedral word greeting 
doubtless asked many things gave many answers 
nothing remains 
comes back picture egyptian prince magas seated meal chamber overlooking moonlit palace garden 
alone noble white bearded man hook nosed hawk eyed telling troubles countrymen christian copts egypt 
look sir said 
could prove worth many could bear witness records kept descendant true line ancient pharaohs country 
moreover daughter grecian mother sprung ptolemies 
race christian three hundred years although among last converted 
yet noble suffer every wrong hands moslems 
goods lands doubly taxed go towns lower egypt must wear garments cross broidered badge shame 
yet live near first cataract nile far city old thebes prophet worshippers real power 
still true ruler district bishop barnabas tell moment standard lifted could call three thousand coptic spears fight christ egypt 
moreover money forthcoming hosts nubia could raised together might sweep moslems like nile flood drive back alexandria 
went set plans sum roman fleet army appear mouths nile besiege capture alexandria help massacre drive every moslem egypt 
scheme set forth much detail seemed feasible enough mastered particulars promised report empress afterwards speak

yesterday empress day well whatever son emperor chooses name

general blind woman put eyes afterwards tried murder felt place watching hanging words speak intently never heard others entering 
paused irene suffer little agony suspense inflicted upon others said see lost friends grave fault 
way greatness 
soldier trusted liked well one unstained honor unstained name 
also loved woman beloved hoped make wife 
trade gone maimed man lead war even meanest service camp rest days granted must spent darkness blacker midnight

little store spent taken bribe heaped riches earn living woman love carried away empress tried thrice murder 
whether shall ever find world know gone far country full enemies christian men 
know whether would willing take one blind beggared husband though think may

yet strange acting lie lady martina found general olaf upon edge yonder hole yes breadth barleycorn death 
general parties heard shall pass sentence 
say yonder woman blinded moment looks last upon light 
say die moment bids farewell life 
thought 
came mind irene fallen power might rise bring fresh evil upon heliodore 
hand opened hand let free someone moved towards heard irene voice whispering ear 
olaf said sinned loved 
would avenged upon one burned soul much evil loved well oh longer olaf 
christ sake pity since fit meet

keep men back martina swear egyptian swear well 
moreover olaf great wealth

let take 
say leave alone one word 
ever power forget everything advance great honor 
brain blinded olaf still rule

spoken 
perchance lady allow olaf speak since much must finish business quickly emperor comes armenians said jodd 
captain jodd comrades said empress irene pleased make certain solemn vows perchance may overheard 
least god heard whether keeps matter god believe 
therefore set vows aside draw neither one way 
made judge matter promised abide judgment 
hear let remembered 
long augusta officer late general chamberlain 
bound great oaths protect harm cases oaths heretofore kept might broken blamed men 
whatever chanced seems still empress still officer seeing sword returned although true sent might use 
pleased empress put eyes 
soldier law monarch rules empire right put eyes officer lifted sword forces even kill 
whether done justly unjustly matter monarch god answer must made last 
therefore would seem right pronounce sentence augusta irene whatever may private wrongs pronounce none 
yet still general another named order free augusta irene work vengeance person aught may befallen hands deeds unjust 
finished speaking silence followed heard irene utter something half sob half gasp wonderment 
murmuring northmen rede strange rose great voice jodd 
general olaf said talking came mind one knife points pierced eyes pricked brain behind 
finished talking came mind great man putting aside private rights wrongs glory revenge lay hand taught us soldiers lesson duty least never shall forget

still lest spawn mischief murder must kept close till councillors decide shall dwell future 
ho guards take royal father widow dower palace watch well

payment would leave go hence augustus answered 
small boon might taken without asking find dog lead like blind wretches 
captain jodd men ask donation may please augustus bestow permission follow wherever general olaf goes since care 
made many enemies sleep night 
empress world falls throne mused constantine even waiting maid attends prison 
blinded captain finds regiment escort hence love honor though new crowned king 
truly fortune jester 
ever fate rob eyes wonder nothing give three hundred faithful swords would follow ruin exile thus thought aloud 
afterwards jodd others martina among went aside leaving seated bench

considered till thought struck 
back beggar harp 
unslung swept chords wild sad sounded solemn place 
began sing old song twice thrice sung heliodore byzantium 
song told lover seeking mistress 
two voices since song mistress answered verse verse

martina exclaimed

olaf become ghost also dwell tomb heliodore tale shall tell palka rest answered 
think best return kurna 
heliodore must play part spirit queen till hire boat escape nile 
never cried 
come together must separate 
oh olaf know life mine dreadful months 
escaped musa stabbing eunuch charge hideous deed may forgiven felt shudder side fled knew whither till found valley hid till night gone 
daybreak peeped mouth valley saw moslems searching yet long way 
also knew valley 
father brought child came search burying place ancestor pharaoh records read told 
remembered everything tomb entered hole found mummy royal lady whose face covered gilded mask breast necklace wear 
ran along valley searching left side eyes till saw flat stone knew 
called table offerings 
sure hole entered tomb quite near stone little face cliff 
climbed found seemed hole though could certain 
crept till came end terror hung hands dropped darkness knowing whither fell caring much killed 
chanced little way finding unhurt crawled along cavern till reached place light roof cave fallen 
crouched amid rocks heard voices soldiers heard officer also bidding bring ropes torches 
left stand sloping passage runs great central chamber sleeps mighty king passage open chambers 
first light morning sun struggles feebly 
entered seeking somewhere hide saw painted coffin lying floor near marble sarcophagus dragged 
found body ancestress since thieves place 
left coffin sarcophagus mummy coffin replaced lids 
mummy lay floor half unwrapped broken two beneath breast 
moreover face remembered like gone dust remained nothing skull hung tresses long black hair indeed may see 
side body gilded mask black staring eyes painted breast piece stiff linen neither thieves found worth stealing 
looked thought came 
lifting mummy thrust sarcophagus save gilded mask painted breast piece stiff linen 
laid coffin lid still lying crosswise hid waist drew gilded mask painted breast piece head bosom 
scarcely done soldiers entered 
reflected sunlight faded place leaving deep shadow men held burning torches made splinters old coffins full pitch 
feet passed saw marks dust said officer 
may hidden place 
search search go hard us return musa tell lost toy 
looked sarcophagus saw broken mummy 
indeed one lifted unwillingly enough let fall saying grimly musa would scarce care companion though day may fair enough 
came coffin

defile corpses 
officer came looked 
haunted hole full ghosts idol worshippers think said 
eyes stare curses us 
well christian maid

went leaving painted linen creaked upon breast breathed 
till nightfall lay coffin fearing lest return tell olaf strange dreams came think swooned slept narrow bed 
yes dreams past shall hear one day live seem 
aye thought dead woman sarcophagus side awoke told 
length rose crept back place stand could see friendly light outworn laid slept 
first break day crawled tomb followed road entered though found hard climb entrance hole 
living thing seen valley except great night bird flitting haunt 
parched thirst knowing dry place soon must perish glided rock rock towards mouth valley thinking find grave cranny might lie hid till night came could descend plain drink 
olaf gone many steps discovered fresh food milk water laid upon rock though feared lest might poisoned ate drank 
knew wholesome thought friend must set satisfy wants though knew friend could 
afterwards learned food offering ghosts dead 
among forefathers forgotten generations know custom make offerings since blindness believed spirts beloved needed sustenance bodies done 
doubtless memory rite still survives least day offerings made 
indeed found made vain brought lacked nothing 
dwelt many moons among dust men departed wandering night 
twice folk seen ventured plains tempted speak ask help 
always fled away believing ghost bygone queen 
indeed speak truth olaf companionship spirits spirits dwell tombs seen tell seen worked upon soul times feel though already company 
moreover knew could live long 
loneliness sucking life dry sand sucks water 
come olaf within days weeks died 
spoke first time saying wish die heliodore 
war musa father magas news came us byzantium irene killed 
believed save believe 
heliodore could feel dead 
therefore fought life otherwise conquered ruined father slain fighting nobly stabbed eunuch 
later tomb came know dead 
lost ones could feel time time never would first seek soul open whisperings 
lived else would died hope burned like lamp unquenchable
