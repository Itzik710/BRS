size guns size ship counts boy 
advantage able sail three feet two probably small carries half many men 
however carry heavy metal give good account 
thirty twos astonish friend comes within range 
stranger large schooner tautness spars rigging showed beautiful order 
crossed line upon merchantman sailing two miles rear bearing followed wake 
charlie stood near captain instead watching sweeping horizon glass

see topmasts make yards 
presently lookout came reported distant vessel appeared large fore aft schooner bearing upon 
two hours yet captain said 
getting dark 
likely engage night keep close show teeth daybreak 
soon became known belief captain vessel wake could seen approaching beam french privateers soon preparing way might happen 
sailors cleared decks loosed guns

small arms cutlasses brought piled round masts 
put sail sir mr ashmead member council said captain 
wife sir objects sound firearms must really beg increase speed 
losing rather gaining upon vessel behind 
duty ships company try fight

unfortunately choice upon present occasion lies gentlemen yonder us 
slightest use adding sail carry best speed schooners could sail round round us 
night comes intend shorten sail put ship fighting trim 
morning shall increase shall make attempt escape combat depends entirely privateers bring choose 
sorry mrs ashmead exposed unpleasantness listening explosion firearms lady passengers exposed danger arise less naval conflict

company given us heavy armament may sure shall best 
seeing gentlemen go guns charlie asked one young writers lad age named peters become friendly go 
yet examined arms uncle given thought since saw gun cases berth first arrival board ship

although grant heavy gun come quite quickly shoulder snap shot 
peters charlie said take double barrel

mine come play first uncle said gave execution close quarters 
dusk schooners exchanged signals flags took positions one quarter ship distance two miles 
think charlie asked friend doctor likely try board us tonight doctor said 
privateers generally depend upon long guns 
know shall watch night hand hand fight would lose considerable number men keeping distance maintaining fire long guns rely upon crippling opponents ranging stern pouring fire close quarters surrender 
another thing prefer daylight see whether vessel approaching 
one cruisers hear cannonade night would come take unaware 
think see daylight coast clear begin 
evidently captain opinion also ordered sail still shortened save watch deck turn 
lights extinguished captain idea evading pursuers wished avoid offering mark fire approach darkness

facts case mr marryat 
owing failure muhammud ali fulfil ridiculously onerous terms extorted native allies siege trichinopoli several state discontent likely soon break open hostilities 
rajahs mysore tanjore learned already communication pondicherry believe shortly acknowledge son chunda sahib dupleix declared ruler carnatic

chief named boorhau reo whose territory lies among hills extends plain nearly plateau land deccan 
position like many small rajahs precarious 
days like present might makes right every petty state tries make profit constant wars expense neighbor position chief surrounded half dozen others powerful means pleasant 
boorhau reo feels danger swallowed nizam mahrattas earnestly desires ally us believing says destined masters

position territory would enable great assistance us war whole force deccan controlled present bussy might utilized us carnatic 
would able harass convoys cut communications otherwise trouble enemy movements 
although see aid would useful us case war see part could give protection 
greatest difficulty brought affairs successful conclusion carnatic dupleix active energetic well supported home 
many chiefs lately allies said declared us question us think supporting chief far removed us boorhau 
therefore told greatly desire friendship present powerless protect attacked northern neighbors 
particularly anxious train men european fashion sees sepoys match five times number untrained troops indian princes

better consultation someone thoroughly understands country 
intended shall go trichinopoli next convoy make way stronghold boorhau 
shall take followers yes mr saunders said 
go character military adventurer served among sepoys long enough learn european drill better take two three four men like retainers

charlie asked rajah strength military force

case taking field three thousand 
defend ambur attack enemy could muster ten thousand men 
could call three thousand men without attracting attention neighbors charlie asked 
rajah said would bring neighbors upon 
suppose however might assemble another five hundred men without attracting attention 
oh yes rajah said eight hundred men force could attract great attention 
propose begin eight hundred charlie said 
month however confine troops present 
must first place train officers 
pick intend give commands subcommands choose men drilling days forty intelligent call noncommissioned officers 
first month work hard teaching officers sub officers duties 
whole eight hundred assemble divide four parties 
one drill instructors party ten officers four five officers appoint 
six weeks hard work make eight hundred men fairly acquainted drill 
english sepoys often gone fight less 
end six weeks let five hundred men called addition bodyguard three hundred return homes replace equal number fresh levies proceed three thousand fighting men thoroughly trained 
nine months six weeks exercise could take places ranks day notice 
two hundred men train artillery although belong branch service learned duties arcot 
rajah agreed heartily charlie proposals well pleased thought end year possessed trained force would enable hold powerful neighbors opportunity might occur alliance english able turn tables upon aggrandize expense

first charlie perceived position excited jealousy minds surrounding rajah 
therefore power show way aspired interfere internal politics affairs little state soldier nothing 
urged upon rajah wished always far better appear hold aloof avoid appearance favouritism desire obtain dominance counsels rajah 
wished appointments posts officers new force made rajah lend ear advice usual councillors appointed absolute command control power dismiss proved indolent incapable promote active energetic men wholly regardless influence position

rajah often came drill ground took highest interest work 
would fain regular uniforms similar worn sepoys service european powers provided men charlie strongly urged 
admitted troops would look immensely better clad regular uniform motley band dressed according fancy 
pointed however news rajah men drilled european deserters would attract little attention among neighbors report raising sepoy battalions would certainly received hostile spirit

served case war sight number sepoy battalions expected meet irregular force immense effect upon force opposed 
rajah saw force argument ordered five thousand suits white uniforms similar worn sepoys english french service made stored magazines

charlie however succeeded restraining pointing victor one day vanquished next worse useless join struggle conditions uncertain changes fortune rapid none could count upon others aid however great assistance might rendered short time 
gain territory rajah might perhaps largely efficient aid might render one party would object hostile combination could hope struggle 
rajah yielded charlie arguments influence latter added hostility favor shown rajah provoked among many leading men state 
sides often closely balanced case intestine struggles aid every rajah however small following sought one combatants counsellors able place respectable force field heavily bribed one side
