evil effects flogging 
incidental considerations touching matter flogging exaggerate evil great enormity 
many illustrations might given let us content 
one arguments advanced officers navy favor corporal punishment inflicted moment consumes valuable time prisoner shirt put last 
whereas another punishment substituted would probably occasion great waste time trouble besides thereby begetting sailor undue idea importance 
absurd worse absurd may appear true start premises officers must admit advance irresistible argument 
accordance principle captains navy certain extent inflict scourge ever hand nearly degrees transgression 
offences cognisable court martial little discrimination shown 
piece penal laws prevailed england sixty years ago one hundred sixty different offences declared statute book capital servant maid pilfered watch hung beside murderer family 
one common punishments trivial offences navy stop seaman grog day week 
seamen cling grog loss generally deemed serious penalty 
sometimes hear say would rather wind stopped grog sober seamen would much rather draw money instead grog provided law often deterred thought receiving scourging inconsiderable offence substitute stopping spirits 
serious obstacle cause temperance navy 
many cases even reluctant drawing grog exempt prudent seaman ignominy besides formal administering cat gangway petty offences liable colt rope end bit ratlin stuff indiscriminately applied without stripping victim time part ship merest wink captain 
express order officer boatswain mates carry colt coiled hats readiness administered minute warning upon offender 
custom neversink 
recent period administration president polk historian bancroft secretary navy officially interposed almost universal thing officers watch discretion inflict chastisement upon sailor face ordinance restricting power flogging solely captains courts martial 
thing unknown lieutenant sudden outburst passion perhaps inflamed brandy smarting sense disliked hated seamen order whole watch two hundred fifty men dead night undergo indignity colt 
believed even present day instances commanders still violating law delegating power colt subordinates 
events certain almost man lieutenants navy bitterly rail officiousness bancroft materially abridging usurped functions snatching colt hands 
time predicted rash ill judged interference secretary would end breaking discipline navy 
proved 
officers predict cat abolished unfulfilled prediction would verified 
concerning license many captains violate express laws laid congress government navy glaring instance may quoted 
upward forty years american statute book law prohibiting captain inflicting authority twelve lashes one time 
given sentence must passed court martial 
yet nearly half century law frequently almost perfect impunity set naught though late exertions bancroft others much better observed formerly indeed present day generally respected 
still neversink lying south american port cruise written seamen belonging another american frigate informed us captain sometimes inflicted upon authority eighteen twenty lashes 
worth state frigate vastly admired shore ladies wonderfully neat appearance 
one forecastle men told used three jack knives charged books purser scraping belaying pins combings hatchways 
singular lieutenants watch american men war long usurped power inflicting corporal punishment colt similar abuses known english navy 
though captain english armed ship authorised inflict discretion dozen lashes think three dozen yet doubted whether upon whole much flogging present english navy american 
chivalric virginian john randolph roanoke declared place congress board american man war carried ambassador russia witnessed flogging taken place plantation five hundred african slaves ten years 
certain personally seen english officers general thing seem less disliked crews american officers 
reason probably many station life accustomed social command hence quarter deck authority sits naturally 
coarse vulgar man happens rise high naval rank exhibition talents incompatible vulgarity invariably proves tyrant crew 
thing american men war men often observed lieutenants southern states descendants old virginians much less severe much gentle gentlemanly command northern officers class 
according present laws usages navy seaman trivial alleged offences may entirely innocent must without trial undergo penalty traces whereof carries grave man war man experienced eye marks naval scourging cat life discernible 
marks back image creator must rise last day 
yet untouchable true dignity cases wherein flogged gangway dishonor though abase hurl last pride sailor piqued times secret motive malicious officer procuring condemned lash 
feeling innate dignity remaining untouched though outwardly body scarred whole term natural life one hushed things buried among holiest privacies soul thing man god ever undiscernible fellow men account degradation seems corporal eye 
torments must seaman undergo back bleeds gangway bleeds agonized drops shame soul justified immeasurably denouncing thing join hands name whose image flogged sailor made let us demand legislators right dare profane god accounts sacred

next idle present day merely denounce iniquity 
different task 
three things opposed genius american constitution irresponsibility judge unlimited discretionary authority executive union irresponsible judge unlimited executive one person 
yet virtue enactment congress commodores american navy obnoxious three charges far concerns punishment sailor alleged misdemeanors particularly set forth articles war 
enactment question 
xxxii 
articles war 
crimes committed persons belonging navy specified foregoing articles shall punished according laws customs cases sea 
article others puts scourge hands captain calls account exercise furnishes ample warrant inflictions cruelty upon common sailor hardly credible landsmen 
article captain made legislator well judge executive 
far goes absolutely leaves discretion decide things shall considered crimes shall penalty whether accused person guilty actions declared crimes penalty shall inflicted 
american navy everlasting suspension habeas corpus 
upon bare allegation misconduct law restrain captain imprisoning seaman keeping confined pleasure 
neversink captain american sloop war undoubted motives personal pique kept seaman confined brig upward month 
certainly necessities navies warrant code government stringent law governs land code conform spirit political institutions country ordains 
convert slaves citizens nation free men 
objections urged laws russian navy essentially different laws navy creating absolute one man power captain vesting authority scourge conform spirit territorial laws russia ruled autocrat whose courts inflict knout upon subjects land 
us different 
institutions claim based upon broad principles political liberty equality 
whereas would hardly affect one iota condition shipboard american man war man transferred russian navy made subject czar 
sailor shares none civil immunities law soil respect accompanies national floating timbers grown thereon clings home 
revolution vain declaration independence lie 
sufficiently borne mind perhaps though naval code comes head martial law yet time peace thousand questions arising man man board ship code certain extent may improperly deemed municipal 
crew men three decker city sea 
matters man man captain instead magistrate dispensing law promulgates absolute ruler making unmaking law pleases 
seen xxth articles war provides person navy negligently perform duties assigned shall suffer punishment court martial shall adjudge offender private common sailor may discretion captain put irons flogged 
needless say cases officer commits trivial violation law court martial seldom never called sit upon trial sailor case condemned lash 
thus one set sea citizens exempted law hung terror others 
would landsmen think state new york pass law offence affixing fine penalty add law section restricting penal operation mechanics day laborers exempting gentlemen income one thousand dollars yet thus spirit practical operation even thus stands good part naval laws wherein naval flogging involved 
law universal include possible penal operations judge gives decisions upon nay judge expounds 
sir william blackstone violated laws england would brought bar presided would tried counsel crown reading perhaps copy commentaries 
found guilty would suffered like meanest subject according law 
american frigate let one example suffice 
articles war especially article american captain may frequently inflict severe degrading punishment upon sailor ever removed possibility undergoing like disgrace probability undergoing punishment whatever even guilty thing contention equals instance punishes another 
yet sailor captain american citizens 
language blackstone law coeval mankind dictated god superior obligation human laws validity contrary 
law law nature among three great principles justinian includes every man rendered due 
seen laws involving flogging navy render every man due since cases indirectly exclude officers punishment whatever cases protect scourge inflicted upon sailor 
therefore according blackstone justinian laws binding force every american man war man would morally justified resisting scourge uttermost resisting would religiously justified would judicially styled act mutiny 
scourging laws reason necessary make binding upon right come sway let us see honest commodore duly authorised congress condemning lash transgressing captain side transgressing sailor 
commodore prove transgressor let us see one brother commodores take lash even boatswain mates navy executioners often called upon scourge 
say navy officer man american born citizen whose grandsire may ennobled pouring blood bunker hill say entering service country common seaman standing ready fight foes thereby loses manhood time asserts say degrades liability scourge tarries ashore time danger safe indignity linked states four continents mankind unite denouncing thought 
plant question topmost argument 
irrespective incidental considerations assert flogging navy opposed essential dignity man legislator right violate oppressive glaringly unequal operations utterly repugnant spirit democratic institutions indeed involves lingering trait worst times barbarous feudal aristocracy word denounce religiously morally immutably wrong 
matter may consequences abolition matter dismantle fleets unprotected commerce fall prey spoiler awful admonitions justice humanity demand abolition without procrastination voice mistaken demand abolition today

something concerning midshipmen 
next morning matchless jack interview commodore captain little incident occurred soon forgotten crew large long remembered seamen habit closely scrutinising every day proceedings 
upon face common event least man war flogging man gangway 
current circumstances case nature magnified particular flogging matter small importance 
story related would well bear recital enough person flogged middle aged man waist forlorn broken miserable object truly one wretched landsmen sometimes driven navy unfitness things else even others driven workhouse 
flogged complaint midshipman hereby hangs drift thing 
though waister ignoble mortal yet scourged one occasion indirectly proceeded mere wanton spite unscrupulousness midshipman question youth apt indulge times undignified familiarities men sooner later almost always suffered capricious preferences 
leading principle involved affair far mischievous lightly dismissed 
cases would seem cardinal principle navy captain subordinates disintegrated parts detached main body special service order minutest midshipman must deferentially obeyed seamen proceeding commodore poop 
principle emphasised remarkable manner valiant handsome sir peter parker upon whose death national arson expedition shores chesapeake bay lord byron wrote well known stanzas 
god war said sir peter sailors make touch hat midshipman coat hung broomstick dry king eye law wrong well known fiction despotic states remained navies constitutional monarchies republics magnify fiction indirectly extending quarter deck subordinates armed ship chief magistrate 
though judicially unrecognised unacknowledged officers yet principle pervades fleet principle every hour acted upon sustain thousands seamen flogged gangway 
however childish ignorant stupid idiotic midshipman orders sailor perform even absurd action man bound render instant unanswering obedience would refuse peril 
obeyed complain captain captain mind thoroughly convinced impropriety perhaps illegality order yet nine cases ten would publicly reprimand midshipman slightest token admit complainant particular thing midshipman done otherwise perfectly right 
upon midshipman complaining seaman lord collingwood captain line battle ship ordered man punishment interval calling midshipman aside said probability fault know therefore man brought mast better ask pardon 
accordingly upon lad public intercession collingwood turning culprit said young gentleman pleaded humanely hope feel due gratitude benevolence time overlook offence 
story related editor admiral correspondence show admiral kindheartedness

yet man indignant tongue treble knotted law suspends death head passion discharge slightest blow boy worm spits feet 
since human nature must ever continue well enough understood practical purposes needs special example prove merest boys indiscriminately snatched human family given authority mature men results must proportionable monstrousness custom authorises worse cruel absurdity 
unworthy remark noblest minded heroic sea officers men topmost stature including lord nelson regarded flogging navy deepest concern without weighty scruples touching general necessity still one seen much midshipmen truly say seen midshipmen enthusiastic advocates admirers scourging

midshipmen entering navy early 
allusion preceding chapter early age midshipmen enter navy suggests thoughts relative important considerations 
general modern impression seems order learn profession sea officer boy hardly sent sea early 
certain extent may mistake 
professions involving knowledge technicalities things restricted one particular field action frequently mastered men begin age twenty one even later period life 
middle seventeenth century british military naval services kept distinct 
previous epoch king officers commanded indifferently either sea land 
robert blake perhaps one accomplished certainly one successful admirals ever hoisted flag half century old fifty one years entered naval service aught professionally ship 
studious turn leaving oxford resided quietly estate country gentleman till forty second year soon became connected parliamentary army 
historian clarendon says first man made manifest science seamanship might attained less time imagined 
doubtless shore sympathies well known humanity kindness blake evinced intercourse sailors large degree imputed 
midshipmen sent navy early age exposed passive reception prejudices quarter deck favor ancient usages however useless pernicious prejudices grow solidify bones 
rise rank naturally carry whence inveterate repugnance many commodores captains slightest innovations service however salutary may appear landsmen 
hardly doubted matters connected general welfare navy government paid rather much deference opinions officers navy considering men almost born service therefore far better qualified judge concerning questions touching people shore 
nation liberal constitution must ever unwise make distinct peculiar profession either branch military men 
true country like nothing present apprehended gaining political rule little apprehended concerning perpetuating creating abuses among subordinates unless civilians full cognisance administrative affairs account competent complete overlooking ordering 
wrong way contribute prevailing mystification thrown internal affairs national sea service 
hitherto affairs regarded even high state functionaries things beyond insight altogether technical mysterious fully comprehended landsmen 
perpetuated navy many evils otherwise would abolished general amelioration things 
army sometimes remodelled navy goes generation generation almost untouched unquestioned code infallible piece perfection statesman could improve 
secretary navy ventures innovate upon established customs hear navy officers say landsman know affairs ever head watch know starboard larboard girt line back stay 
deferentially cheerfully leave navy officers sole conduct making shortening sail tacking ship performing nautical maneuvers may seem best let us beware abandoning discretion general municipal regulations touching well great body men mast let us beware much influenced opinions matters natural suppose long established prejudices enlisted

dog watches embracing two hours early part evening form authorised play time crews ships sea 
among diversions present licensed authority neversink single stick sparring hammer anvil head bumping 
direct patronage captain otherwise seeing consequences sometimes led would undoubtedly strictly prohibited 
curious coincidence navy captain happen admirer fistiana crew seldom amuse way 
single stick every one knows delightful pastime consists two men standing feet apart rapping head long poles 
good deal fun long hit hit judgment discreet persons spoils sport completely 
pastime practiced connoisseurs ashore wear heavy wired helmets break force blows 
helmets tars nature furnished 
played great gun rammers 
sparring consists playing single stick bone poles instead wooden ones
