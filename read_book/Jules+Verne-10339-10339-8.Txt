poor dear halbrane

iceberg stopped passage perhaps would drifted land direction might boat accomplish would done captain shaking head answered nothing 
west also silent 
eh iceberg end raising anchor replied hurliguerly 
hold bottom like falklands kerguelens safest course wait boat carry twenty three number party

undoubtedly captain added 
probably know geographers frankly admit antarctic regions formed capped continent 
geographers know nothing know nothing replied west coldly 
pity said near attempt solve question polar continent 
thought better insist present 
moreover would danger sending boat voyage discovery current might carry far might find us place 
indeed iceberg happened get loose bottom resume interrupted drift would become men boat drawback boat small carry us necessary provisions 
seniors remained ten men counting dirk peters new men thirteen twenty three 
largest number boat could hold eleven twelve persons 
eleven us indicated lot would remain island ice 
would become regard hurliguerly made sound observation

perhaps boatswain right 
mind asked boat might utilized purpose reconnoitring iceberg 
finally decided arrange everything view wintering even ice mountain drift

necessary must done replied mate day must set work 
sad day began preparations 
endicott cook man submitted without murmuring

oh yes know loss schooner poor halbrane carried air like balloon flung deep llke avalanche hand iceberg brought us coast tsalal boat brought us captain william guy three companions together

although waters portion sea still open carried flotilla icebergs ice fields 
hence arose serious difficulties also dangers navigation midst gloomy mists maneuver moving masses either find passage prevent little craft crushed like grain millstones 
besides captain len guy could longer ascertain position either latitude longitude
