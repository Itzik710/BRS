priests live best houses eat best food wear best clothes indeed flower nation would produce magnificent sons daughters 
could bring children according teaching holy church well priests idea speak unfolding rich variety every evening 
soon realized advantages would accrue beyond addition forty thousand children birth rate one advantage seemed exceed original advantage would nationalisation religion formation irish catholicism suited ideas needs irish people 
beginning century irish lost language middle century characteristic aspects religion 
remembered cardinal cuilen denationalised religion ireland 
everyone recognized mistake could church nationalised better rescission decree wives begetting children would attach priests soil ireland

irish priests always good latinists murmured hunted dictionary 
table littered books found necessary create latin atmosphere beginning translation 
worked principally night one morning three finished translation getting chair walked whitening window 
eyes pained decided would postpone reading written till morning 
illusions regarding latin broken 
laid manuscript table bedside awakening reached hand read page dropped manuscript lay floor dressed

last norah flynn priest blushed deeply 
first time looked one parishioners light possible spouse entered house frightened looked round parlor asked day would come see norah flynn sitting opposite armchair 
face flushed deeper looked towards bedroom door fell knees prayed god might made known 
night awoke many times dream awakened continued left bed wandered round round room darkness seeking way 
last reached window drew curtain saw dim dawn opening bog 
thank god said dream dream 
lying fell asleep immediately another dream horrible first appeared housekeeper heard beating walls 
dream dream said 
lay awake daring sleep lest might dream 
seven clock heard housekeeper telling inspector come tell must decide direction new road take 
inspector opinion run parallel old road 
continue old road two miles would involve extra labor people would go work stones would drawn 
priest held extra labor secondary importance 
said make two roads running parallel would wanton humiliation people 
inspector could appreciate priest arguments 
held people thinking might earn enough money fill bellies 
agree agree said priest 
better go opposite direction make road sea 
well reverence government wish engage upon work benefit special class 
instructions 
road sea benefit one see thinking landlord 
harbor boat ever comes flat waste sea 
well reverence one days harbor may made whereas arch would look well middle bog people would go far work 

road sea quite useless futility apparent least apparent people hearts broken 
inspector seemed little doubtful priest assured futility road would satisfy english ministers 
yet english ministers priest reflected stupid men merely men blinded theory prejudice men live world 
folly apparent next generation ever ever world without end 
worst priest said people earning living roads fields lying idle crops next year 
father macturnan began think cardinals transaction business vatican cardinals ministers alike dupes convention 
estranged habits customs think straightforward 
instead insisting absurd roads government would give money able feed people cost penny day would able sow potatoes

first thought priest ordered broken 
two little boys heard priest talking 
tell strange stories dublin statue 
appears seeing father mccabe went straight father brennan priests sat till midnight sipping punch considering fine point theology man may ask woman sit naked would justifiable employ naked woman statue virgin 
father brennan said nakedness sin father mccabe said nakedness may sin leads sin therefore unjustifiable 
third tumbler punch reached raphael fourth father mccabe held bad statues likely excite devotional feelings good ones bad statues removed perilous nature

courtship walking passion direct inspiration world music art reduced mere act begetting children 
love books passage emigrant ship said rodney 
speak truly

harding sit saying nothing 
going back ireland 
came carmady telling harding acting fairly towards biographer 
poor man able explain celtic episode satisfactorily 
nothing short balzac could make convincing 
rodney laughed loudly idea amused could imagine man refraining excess might disturb perplex confuse biographer 
celtic idea come harding remember ideas come anyone said harding 
thought passes 
sudden feeling comes never 
looking across park view mountains distance perceived pathetic beauty country perceived year afterwards driving dublin mountains met two women road something pathetic wistful something dear something intimate felt drawn towards 
felt like live among people 
proverb irish says man ever wanders far grave sod 
thrown circle air return feet thrower 
astonished interest everybody takes departure 
everyone seems agreed nothing could foolish nothing mad 
go meet asher marseilles cruise greek islands go cairo spend winter talking wearisome society everyone would consider conduct rational 
dear friend rodney tempt italy conversations yellowing marbles angry tell interesting utterances italian renaissance would interest half much paddy durkin father pat say roadside
