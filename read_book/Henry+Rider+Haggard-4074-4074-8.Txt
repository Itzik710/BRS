country lived lonely savages still roamed hated white man might steal kill also full leopards hyenas beasts prey would devour

well jan went beg loan tutor thinking would able understand english boy said due course creature came pair blue spectacles riding mule dared trust horse 
afterwards child woke long sleep fed dressed tutor spoke ugly english tongue could never even bear sound story drew 
seems boy gave name ralph kenzie though believe really ralph mackenzie traveling father mother many others country called india one places english stolen different parts world stole cape natal rest 
traveled long big ship india long way till near coast storm sprang wind blown two days driven rocks hundred miles away stead 
fierce sea quickly ship break pieces one boat got except crew six men filled women children 
boat boy ralph mother given place father come although captain begged man importance whose life value common people

came story died away stories sad world many years heard 
boy ralph like haunted child 
night even daytime would seized terror sob cry way piteous behold though wondered knew history 
fits took strange may seem one could calm heart one suzanne 
see seen thrice remember boy sitting bed stare agony eyes sweat running face damping yellow hair talking rapidly half english half dutch voice times would rise scream times would sink whisper shipwreck lost parents black indian woman nursed wilderness tigers kaffirs fell many things 
sits suzanne soft kaross jackal skins wrapped nightgown dew sleep still showing upon childish face large dark eyes 
sits talking words us little meaning voice shrill sinking croon one hand clasps wrist strokes brow till shadow passes soul clinging close sinks back sleep 
years went fits grew rarer till last ceased altogether since thanks god childhood forget grief 
cease however lad love suzanne love possible yet deeper 
brother may love sister affection however true yet lacks something since nature teaches never complete 
beginning yes even children twain brother sister friend friend lover lover remained till life left remain aye whatever life live 
thought one thought heart one heart neither variableness shadow turning one soul separate spirits one flesh separate bodies 
write old woman though many things ignorant seen much world men live yet say never known marvel compare marvel beauty love ralph kenzie castaway sweet daughter suzanne

boers think little book learning holding man read holy word enough

learned history reading writing something english tongue need scarcely say would suffer teach pry mystery god stars wished hold lore impious akin witchcraft seen enough sihamba others 
asked hollander particularly fled van voorens would tell little wizardries practiced 
might believe heer van vooren made custom entertaining kaffir witch doctors doctoresses house celebrating secret devilish rites son swart piet initiated presence 
last story true doubt indeed seeing events years prove 
well last hollander left us marry rich old vrouw twenty years senior say except possible disliked walked house walked though done know harmless body 
perhaps played flute always thought contemptible man 
chapter iv shadow englishmen pass time ralph nineteen thereabouts save lack hair upon face man grown since climate young people ripen quickly body mind

cloud wind passed away leaving night beautiful sat watch listening music waterfall splashed deep sea pool soft surge waves lapped gently narrow beach 
length ralph spoke low voice 
sweet time sleep said kissed 
time whispered back husband first let us kneel together pray almighty bless married life make us happy 
good thought answered days young men brought christians ashamed say prayers even presence others 
knelt side side upon edge cliff faces set towards open sea 
pray us aloud ralph said suzanne though heart full enough words 
ralph prayed simply saying oh god madest us hear us thy son daughter bless us 
night married life begins thou us ever please thee children let thy blessing go days 
oh god thank thee thou didst save alive sea lead feet child wife place starving suzanne thanks thee whisperings dream feet led thus 
oh god believe thou didst hear prayer lost child knelt dying rock believe thou dost hear first prayer wedded life

word go long half insane harangue suzanne sat quite silent making reply even seeming hear demon whose wicked talk defiled ears 
asked whether nothing say went still looking beyond gave answer one word used awoke swoon murderer 
something tone spoke perhaps substance short speech seemed cow least turned left hut presently sihamba heard talking sentry without bidding keep close watch till came back within hour 
piet went left door board hut open sihamba dared neither act speak fearing lest guard hear see 
therefore still lay upon top hut watched smoke hole 
suzanne sat quiet upon bed sudden rose shuffling across hut well bound feet would allow closed opening door board secured wooden bar 
next returned bed seating upon clasped hands began pray muttering aloud mixing prayer name husband ralph 
ceasing presently thrust hand bosom drew knife large strong sharp 
opening knife cut thong bound ankles made noose 
looked earnestly first noose next knife thirdly candles sihamba understood meant death choosing steel rope fire 
although dared much whisper sihamba idle blade assegai working gently thatch smoke hole cutting rimpis bound till last soon thought wide enough allow passage small body 
watching guard leaned hut bulge would cut sight instant figure outlined sky stood thrusting feet hole forced body follow dropped lightly cat floor beneath 
another danger faced great one namely suzanne might cry fear doubtless would done sudden sight living creature hut thought alone startled moment lost breath

next second dead dead without sound sihamba doctoress knew well thrust spear 
suzanne heard nothing saw nothing till presently sihamba stood side holding skin cape one hand spear 
one danger done said quietly put cape many still remain 
follow swallow going edge stream hooted like owl whereupon zinti came reeds looking cold frightened 
swift whispered sihamba started along krantz run 
half way across storm clouds thinning gradually broke altogether moon shone bright light showing plainly though day chanced met nobody seen none 
length reached cleft rock led plain

slip rock cover man gun saying stirs hand speaks word shoot dead 
hold thus till past way wood follow us best fire except save life 
gifts zinti lay rather tracking remembering paths directions fighting men heard order afraid hesitated

thus stood indeed perceived new wife chief escaping 
remembering would fate hands bull head determined take chance shot turning suddenly sped towards kraal shouting ran whereon zinti fired ball went wide 
cannon could scarcely made noise great roer silence night report echoed fro among hills 
oh fool fire yet greater fool miss said sihamba

let us head peak since nowhere else go separated let us agree meet upon southern slope 
zinti loose mule lives save ride remembering death behind 
chapter xix schimmel crossed red water turned horses heads swart piet men much hundred paces wood gained much ground think would dare leave hunted racing open plain mile away 
last caught sight crossing distant ridge long chase began 
hour hour galloped moonlight across wide rolling veldt moon sank must pick way best could darkness 
came dawn still rode forward though horses beginning grow weary except schimmel pulled upon bit though fresh stable 
front twenty miles away rose lofty peak heading behind lay great expanse plain passed 
suzanne looked back shoulder one sight

next three miles ground trended downwards banks great river beyond gentle rising slopes surrounded foot high peak 
galloped schimmel never faltering swinging stride although flanks grew thin eyes large 
gray mare otherwise though gallant nag strength gone 
indeed heavier rider upon back ere would fallen 
still answered sihamba voice plunged rolling stumbling gait 
last till river said seeing suzanne look mare 
gasped suzanne glancing behind five hundred yards away swart piet kaffirs hunted sullenly silence strong dogs hunt wounded buck

half mile away came sight river hidden lie ground groan despair broke lips flood 
yes storms mountains swollen rolled towards sea red flood foam flecked water well nigh two hundred yards bank bank 
still rode dared stop presently behind heard shout triumph knew pursuers also seen red water rejoiced trap 
within ten yards lip river gray mare stopped suddenly shivered like leaf wind sank ground 
swallow said sihamba slipped saddle must choose raging torrent swart piet 
choose torrent great horse still strong may swim say 
asked suzanne

seeing would indeed less sihamba took outstretched hand placing foot upon foot suzanne scrambled upon pad front whereat pursuers little two hundred yards away laughed loud swart piet shouted suzanne yield 
laugh long sihamba first bent head kissed suzanne hand leaned forward began stroke schimmel neck whisper ear till indeed seemed though great brute loved understood 
least pricked ears tossed head looked first round horses drew near next foaming flood front

sound word stallion drew together sprang forward two bounds ten paces level bank leapt far flood foamed beneath 
sank horse riders till red water closed heads rose heard shout wonder enemies almost reached bank

schimmel struck bravely heading bank fierce current possible horse reach swimming straight line weight stream great 
sihamba noted however shore two three hundred paces lower river little point land projected horse seen also perhaps told least point swam steadily 
five minutes center torrent ran roar mighty force waves began break schimmel head feared would drown 
much sihamba fear indeed slipped back leaving suzanne cling saddle caught hold mane floating alongside protected neck whirl water 
lying thus continued call horse urge forward ever answered words although twice nearly sank end set feet upon sandbank rested plunged forward half wading half swimming projecting point land scrambled still carrying suzanne dragging sihamba found safe upon solid earth stood shaking snorting 
suzanne slipped saddle lay flat upon ground looking awful water passed lay sihamba 
presently little doctoress spoke 
well lived said dared deed others ever made passage across red water flood two one tired horse caught arms muzzle schimmel hung pressing breast though child whereon brute whinnied faintly knowing well thanking toil courage 
pray god may never called upon make answered suzanne staggering feet water running dripping dress turned look across river

therefore umpondwana built stone schanzes fortifications mouth river gushed mountain thumb finger like ridges eastern slope although lay impregnable walls rock seeing river must look main supply water 
table top hill could approached one path wound upwards ravine cut water swept every wind heaven high air cold naked 
indeed winter season rain fell twice thrice week many days wrapt dense white mist 
still two years dwelt umpondwana suzanne scarcely left plain desire dare word brought foot even slopes mountain patrolled men employ swart piet 
moreover soon became clear knowledge movements doubtless spies pay dwelt among umpondwana 
first months sojourn mountain true suzanne rode veldt mounted schimmel pastime forced abandon one day swart piet men saw gave chase saved fleetness great horse

things went long 
swart piet men great harm indeed harassed continually people umpondwana began murmur could scarcely stir beyond slopes mountain without set upon 
happily slopes wide otherwise could found pasturage cattle land upon grow corn 
close watch kept upon indeed could neither travel visit tribes could come thus came suzanne utterly cut rest world though dead 
one hope keep heart alive ralph jan would learn fate native rumors able find

descending seat sought sihamba 
swallow said little woman tidings eyes 
zinti returns answered seen far away 
sihamba smiled thought zinti lost also believe possible sihamba could recognized distance 
still two hours zinti came gaunt footsore healthy unharmed sitting suzanne private enclosure began beginning long story native fashion telling things befallen upon day left mountain nearly two years

zinti set story suzanne listened silence praising much thanking done 
day heart failed seemed give hope 
ralph vanished parents vanished left alone prisoner among little kaffir tribe foot whose stronghold bitter enemy waited destroy 
never white woman dreadful solitary state sihamba tender friendship felt must died 
also swart piet grew bolder appearing even slopes mountain men harried stole 
even one morning dawn attacked pass leading stronghold secretly skill force halfway sentries discovered 
seen war horns blew followed great fight 
indeed lucky chance doubtful fight would ended onslaught fierce umpondwana best bravest warriors taken surprise 
remembered zinti brought ralph gun first fled north gun still together little powder ball fearing lest stolen taken great journey transkei back 
hearing tumult ran fired point blank stormers pushing way narrow path driving umpondwana 
roar loaded slugs scattering killed three men moreover good fortune one slugs struck van vooren fleshy part thigh causing fall whereon thinking mortally wounded spite curses commands followers lost heart fled bearing 
sihamba called upon people follow would feared meet swart piet open 
truth began weary constant war brought upon fault quarrel ask good luck white swallow promised 
loved suzanne beauty gentle ways sihamba cleverness good rule mastered minds little doubt indeed would asked suzanne depart among 
day following attack sihamba learned swart piet lay sick lost much blood sought persuade people attack turn make end robbers 
would council broke sihamba spoken bitter words telling cowards would meet end cowards whereat went away sullenly 
afterwards learned spies van vooren gone zululand visit king dingaan sihamba thought evil tidings scented fresh danger journey without reason 
suzanne said nothing 
two months went peacefully one morning herd tending cattle belonged suzanne sihamba sought audience chieftainess 
asked sihamba saw man face something strange happened 
lady answered 
went kloof dawn cattle lady swallow kraaled found among strange oxen number hundred 
beautiful oxen never seen every one pure white white muzzle tail understand came among cattle mouth kraal closed usual last night moreover found closed morning 
sihamba heard turned cold heart knew well spotless white cattle must come royal herd dingaan king zulus since none known like land 
also sure swart piet stolen placed among cattle bring upon tribe terrible wrath dingaan remembered mingling cattle trick played 
herd said doubtless cattle strayed would make enquiry owner 
dismissed bidding keep better watch future 
scarcely gone another man appeared saying met kaffir beyond mountains told party white men women children crossed quathlamba range known bezuidenhout pass camped near tugela river 
strange news sihamba heard nothing whereabouts trek boers strange would speak suzanne fearing lest fill false hopes 
sent zinti bade cross quathlamba little used pass known near place tugela takes rise day called mont aux sources following river find whether true white men encamped upon banks 
done return swiftly possible whatever information could gather 
task zinti undertook gladly loved following spoor gift nature given also weary cooped like fatting fowl upon mountain umpondwana 
zinti gone sihamba summoned messengers commanded travel swiftly kraal umgungundlhovo bearing homage dingaan king amazulus asking whether lost cattle royal herds since certain white oxen found among beasts though came could tell 
men went also though fear trembling since days none loved approach lion zulu tales cattle strayed among herd 
still went doubt heart sihamba sat awaiting return 
chapter xxviii coming impi sihamba long wait evening fifth day starting messengers came back great speed run fast could scarcely speak want breath telling zulu impi numbering three thousand spears advancing upon umpondwana destroy 
seemed long king oxen found mixed herd reported dingaan sihamba stolen altogether strange seeing swart piet traveled impi 
suspected caused oxen stolen fixed deed upon knowing well dingaan sought pretext destroy tribe zulus ancient quarrel 
one thing done make ready defense without ado sihamba summoned council told zulu impi hand eat white cattle placed among herds 
councillors wrung hands shed tears even although aged men name zulus struck terror hearts expected nothing less death wives children

cattle driven center kraal great supplies grass green corn cut feed 
except one manhole pass leading top mountain closed schanzes walls protected mouth river welled hillside eastern ridges strengthened garrisoned 
sihamba knew weak place river flowed beneath impregnable precipices rock must look main supply water since although spring upon tableland husbanded would suffice supply tribe sufficient cattle 
reason sihamba wished turn kine loose let zulus capture would knew could never take mountain harm hair head one inhabitants 
umpondwana greedy would consent loss cattle forgetting cattle value dead men 
said could well defend schanzes surrounded source river sufficient water could carried keep beasts alive even siege long 
answered sihamba shortly see defend zulu warriors leap upon walls fail lose cattle life together 
time according daily custom suzanne seated chair rock upon highest point precipice looking help never came 
presently watched sad eyes far away upon plain saw cloud dust moved shone sheen spears 
climbed seat ran seek sihamba found surrounded councillors 
swallow asked little chieftainess looking though already guessed answer 
suzanne told adding travels towards mountain great force lady swallow said sihamba gravely army zulus sent dingaan destroy us marches bull head 
told trick cattle messengers seen 
suzanne heard face grew white goatskin cloak wore 
last long story end faltered knew terrible prowess zulus none could stand onslaught 
yes impi end answered sihamba proudly children mine take heart fight fathers fought 
fear lady swallow nothing wings storm mountain umpondwana 
could say suzanne still felt much afraid strange knew heart soldiers sihamba knew moreover zulu army dare defeated reason must either take mountain fight till destroyed 
confusion horns blew women wailed captains umpondwana issued commands men piled stones upon brink precipice roll upon foe drove herds cattle great kraal upon tableland 
marching quickly impi drew near defenders could see numbered four thousand spears composed two separate regiments 
distance mile halted throwing horns wings surrounded mountain slopes advanced thin circle much beaters driving game certain point 
circle drew nearer cliffs thickened less ground cover though still gap 
presently watching saw man dart one gaps run hill great speed followed zulu soldiers tried kill 
swifter foot moreover knew path could come reached great stone walls built source river dragged defenders 
later man appeared upon top mountain proved none zinti returned errand news tell risked life pass impi stronghold altogether surrounded 
sihamba received suzanne standing side bade brief little time listen long stories 
brief zinti answered 
lady bade crossed mountains road told 
good road men foot horseback waggons could travel 
reached plain side followed bank river till suddenly came sight thirty waggons drawn laager upon knoll ground among waggons saw boers wives children

keep along bank river went wish go quickly must head large white topped hill koppie seen mountains come find boer laager upon knoll foot near banks river winds round 
oh let us go let us go quickly said suzanne springing feet thought even seeing white man made drunk hope 
alas sister answered sihamba sadly hour ago might gone rather might gone mounted great schimmel look pointed zulus clustered like bees along banks river path ran 
see added one road stronghold nowhere else surest footed climber world descend cliffs rope help road thick zulu spears moreover certain man wish see waits upon 
suzanne looked

chapter xxix thirst sihamba finished talk captains dingaan sun already sinking 
still umpondwana thought zulus would attack shouted defenders might rest easily till dawn since wished daylight divide spoil 
daylight attack came 
driving men bull head front much knew cowards wished make mock company company zulus rushed stone wall though many killed often driven back 
always came laughing shouting war cry till arms umpondwana grew weary stabbing plumed heads appeared level wall 
still fighting eye sihamba whose bitter tongue feared people held indeed place almost impregnable attacks men armed spears however brave might defended warriors true zulu blood could never taken 
fight raged hour zulu captains withdrew men went apart consult van vooren loss heavy saw capture head waters river must seek plan 
soon found 
river issued side mountain little stream broad fierce water 
deep rapid triple line defense works umpondwana built edge water ran rocky gorge although thorn trees fastened trunks thrust ten twelve feet banks gorge either side stream 
center river may thirty paces wide long ridge saddle rock water boiled furiously although three feet deep 
ridge began point within last line walls ran five twenty paces first wall 
swart piet noted ridge

bull head asked captain 
thus 
yonder stand trees tall stems green tops cut make bridge bank saddle wade saddle water waist deep till past third wall reach bank inside best 
although brave man zulus days captain looked long doubtfully white water foamed upon ridge 
death water said 
death victory others answered van vooren fear go back dingaan tell way mountain taken seeing impregnable thirst alone conquer 
fear nothing white man answered zulu brave show us black people way along yonder ridge piet shrugged shoulders 
wish keep alive reasons besides soldier dingaan answered 
captain turned commanded men battle axes cut three longest trees although task difficult wood hard axes light 
length trees rolled uphill spot ridge rock ended thirty paces face outer wall 
sihamba guessed purpose first time believed cutting trees use battering rams walls 
coming us path river said called men sally prevent making bridge bank saddle 
none answered dared face zulus open 
water sweep away said moreover try land spear 
cowards moaned heads doom 
umpondwana contented standing behind first wall casting volleys spears thrust trees within thirty paces zinti shot gun killing several 
coming zulus made shield hedge protect comrades light throwing assegais little hurt gun killed thought nothing 
presently ends trees lay beneath water ridge rock captain commanded certain induna lead men across 
natives fear wet death though brave man would gladly rushed fortifications alone commanded soldier captain spoke looked askance furious torrent hesitated 
captain served chaka knew deal showed doubt fear 
lifting heavy assegai drove man fell dead smote cried coward take gift king calling soldiers ran upon bridge tree trunks leaped water rose middle 
instant would swept away current fierce followed sprang side behind 
moment managed keep feet till others came giving support protected breakwater built men gone first 
forming double line man linked arms round middle comrade front kaffir girls link dance slowly human chain began struggle forward along back ridge 
times indeed weight stream almost much swept deep water ran either side strong rope human muscles held dragged back 
lip first walls umpondwana soldiers hurled spears banks killing many 
man slain even badly wounded companions held let go needful thrust water could longer serve king 
gripped soldier stood front lost one chain dragged 
oh men umpondwana cried sihamba half heart brave need fear nothing dingaan zulus stream heard called answer right little chieftainess brave 
slowly black snake like line pressed forward white foam never heeding storm spears slew continually till point well within third line walls 
captain chance escaped called order behind head double line leapt ridge rock deep water swimming feet still gripping hands suffered swung round current towards bank twenty yards away 
rocks jutted great struggle able grasp hold 
followed suzanne watching afterwards declared strangest sight ever seen men swung fro current anchored ridge bank made living bodies bridge fellows 
yes companions ran crawled springing shoulder shoulder driving heads beneath water push clinging feet 
half drowned almost torn two still held till enough men safe shore finish fray 
umpondwana saw zulus bank stay kill landed might easily done dragging sihamba ran gorge leading flat top mountain blocked great stones ready 
came zulus fight though great loss cut umpondwana main supply water 
though fight mountain 
resting began work storming narrow gorge led upwards tableland gorge gate first suffered pull climb walls built across little resistance 
soon however found reason number gorge stones began roll upon edges cliffs crushing life many presently driven back head river 
afterwards searched long earnestly could find path attack none 
well said zulu captain seems must fight fight sit since rock rabbits let us come must wait till come us ask water 
waited seven whole days setting guards mountain case secret ways egress knew nothing 
reached tableland sihamba spoke words bitter councillors captains stopped ears might hear others answered could nothing men walked upon boiling waters 
indeed nothing sihamba cried thirst fight best friends 
cowardice must perish everyone us part glad given lady swallow death also 
buried face ground would say even told zulus beaten back rocks rolled upon 
days little spring gave enough water thousands people crowded upon mountain top though none spare cattle 
third night poor beasts maddened thirst broke kraal rushing spring trampled hoofs waters sealed little could obtained even digging rock came near surface soil would seem though course spring turned choked beneath 
upon mountain began suffer horrors thirst 
soon cattle altogether mad rushing fro herds bellowing furiously goring everyone met trampling earth 
umpondwana strove rid driving gorge zulus guessing trouble presence beasts bringing upon besieged would suffer pass 
next attempted force edge precipice driven oxen turned charged killing several men 
contented stabbing dangerous animals leaving rest rush fro would care kill lest carcasses breed pestilence 
sixth day came oh great kraal umpondwana hell wherein lost souls wandered torment sun beat upon fiercely everywhere roamed lay men women children overcome torture thirst indeed last already dead especially breast mothers milk dry 
three men dragged old wife hut beating make reveal store water believed hidden others cutting throat ox might drink blood yonder little girl turning stones lick damp side poor parched tongue 
midst scenes passed outside hut sat sihamba brooding

sihamba eyes fell upon child licking stones heart wrung pity 
going hut fetched water gourd calling child staggered towards could scarcely walk gave bidding drink slowly 
moment gone every drop behold dim eyes brightened shrunken limbs seemed grow round young voice longer high cracked praised blessed name 
sihamba motioned child away went hut weep weep could since eyes dry tears

thought thus suzanne entered hut tidings eyes

chapter xxxi sihamba farewell began work much must done daylight came 
first sihamba took sharp knife cut suzanne beautiful hair close head left curled naturally 
disguise though dark fine hair native put grease upon powdered blue dust kaffir women use

groan suzanne yielded crouching upon floor like native awaited return sihamba 
presently came followed zinti good case though somewhat thin zinti clever provident foreseeing would come hidden water among rocks 
zinti said sihamba would speak secret matters

stranger zinti said sihamba one know well

wow said wonderful

words suzanne sprang looking though weep sihamba stopped lips fierce words blows though took small heed either stood staring 
zinti sihamba said done many services day must greatest

follow giving zinti jar pigment long goat skin cloak suzanne wore outer garment left hut carrying hand strips ox hide tanned white 
avoiding groups thirst tormented people sat wandered coolness night passed gates kraal unheeded walking quickly across wide stretch tableland reached eastern edge cliff 
upon verge cliff rose sharp pinnacle rock fifty feet air upon top pinnacle stone shaped like great chair suzanne sat day day poised like eagle dizzy gulf space slopes mountain swelled five hundred feet beneath watching help never came 
far base point sihamba began search starlight till found wanted body young woman crept die thirst whose death place reported 
took jar white clay aided zinti set ghastly task daubing stuff thickly upon cold features neck arms feet 
soon done work needed little care began true toil since corpse must carried sharp point rock easy path 
zinti strong could never done still aid suzanne sihamba last finished 
steep place toiled three dragging dead body knob knob rock well knowing one false step gloom would send broken pieces hundreds feet beneath 
length reached little platform scarcely room stand burden climbing stone called chair zinti drew dead woman seat 
sihamba bade wrapped suzanne long white cape goat skin putting hood upon head made corpse fast sitting posture lashing round neck middle back stone white tanned rimpis fashion could fall even slip 
said sihamba grimly sits bridge upon swart piet feast eyes seek safety across mountains 
back town height already see light glimmering east 
accordingly returned hut entered leaving zinti without none noting since multitudes thronging narrow way 
sihamba lit lamp light examined suzanne carefully retouching dye place till sure gleam white showed

yes thus parted always flesh since fated meet world whether permitted sihamba kaffir christian enter better one say 
case however hope found hole creep although black witch doctoress according knowledge good woman brave one reader say also comes end story 
outside hut zinti took suzanne arm led mazes town open ground lay mouth steep cleft ran slopes mountain 
space crowded people yet could enter cleft nowhere ten feet wide filled cattle alive dead drawn smell water beneath gathered near stone walls blocked pass would allow 
suzanne zinti mingled crowd fugitives taking position almost midst wish pass either among first last 
waited none noting great agony thirst thought neighbors 
indeed husbands deserted sick wives mothers children heavy carry yes deserted trampled feet men hoofs cattle 
eastern sky grew gray though sun yet risen light man could see veins upon back hand white moons finger nails 
presently though moved one impulse thousands voices uttered hoarse cry dawn open open would seem wall still stood cattle remained packed dense mass man could walked upon backs indeed tried 
last sun rose rather rays shot upwards across eastern skies like fan fire 
suzanne turned head watched till presently arrows light struck upon tall chair rock highest point mountain 
yes chair sat white figure side stood seemed black child 
sihamba 
far eyes watching also eyes swart piet would let people go knew suzanne sihamba stayed behind 
saw suzanne accustomed place side sihamba 
pull walls shouted men eager clear pass cattle kaffirs might go obeyed 
half oxen pushing leaping forward madly cleared left open mouthed lolling tongues hanging dry jaws rushed downward water goring trampling death worked wall 
schanzes screamed people seeing long line cattle move immediately began press forward also

went forward bearing upon hip act mercy lack reward shall seen salvation 
also child lived day faithful servant house though beard white 
narrow way surged crowd scrambling rocks dead cattle crushed women children till last suzanne drew near opening stood swart piet twenty followers watching multitude pass 
lady whispered zinti ear fall behind bull head may know 
win rejoin plain saw edged rock throw away child follow road told scarcely mistake 
go showing fear stay let blanket hang open front custom women wear garments wrapped closely 
suzanne groaned obeyed 
chapter xxxii pass quathlamba like wild beasts escaping pen red eyed gasping mob rushed staggered edge water plunging heads hoarse grunts cries drank drank drank 
indeed several lost lives filled full vitals ruptured thrust river cattle pressing behind carried away swift stream 
mouth pass suzanne laden child pushed followed doubtless would trampled death one swart piet men desiring clear way perhaps moved pity plight dragged feet 
done let go held staring beauty greedy eyes 
rock rabbit shall keep wife cried 
would rather take twenty fat oxen 
suzanne heart nearly stood still terror 
water water moaned let drink pray 
fear take drink pretty went man still staring 
losing command suzanne screamed struggled sound cries reached ears swart piet standing close hand 
asked man 
nothing bull head except taken woman wish wife fair 
van vooren let eyes rest upon dreamily thoughts given sat aloft five hundred feet head feeling glance suzanne blood froze veins 
yes fair answered married woman umpondwana brats among people

van vooren wish men remained cumber women children since needed look cattle 
maid wife choose one said man sulkily 
black piet whose sullen temper could brook crossed broke blaze rage 
dare disobey shouted awful kaffir oath 
let go dog kill 
man knew master loosed hold suzanne ran away though reached water noticed white ring round arm grip rubbed paint skin beneath 
strangely enough van vooren saw ring distance mistook ivory ornament kaffir women often wear elbow 
still strangely white color made think white woman sat aloft yonder turned face upwards forgetting black girl child 
thrusting crowd suzanne ran till clear worst terrified though could resist temptation water longer mouth throat felt dry rough 
climbing edge river drank greedily shelter rock satisfied thirst poured water mouth child dipping shrunken little body stream whereon seemed increase eyes like dry sponge left rain 
tended child thus began find senses wail feebly chanced look terror saw man escaped walking along bank looking 
happy suzanne rock crouched hid man stood thirty seconds within two paces obliged plunge body boy water stifle crying 
happened kaffir caught sight another woman infant hundred yards away ran towards 
thereon suzanne replacing half choked child upon back climbed bank hiding white mark upon arm beneath blanket taking shelter could behind stones cattle knots people thirst appeased hastening escape slipped across shoulder slope 
sight swart piet men first time many day began breathe freely 
crept round flank mountain best speed struck across plain straight saw edged rock ten miles away marked entrance pass quathlamba range 
time time suzanne looked behind none followed search would could discover trace zinti began fear must come harm 
one thing could see however whitened corpse set high chair rock side black dot knew sihamba 
twice turned round gazed second time dot become almost imperceptible although still 
long earnestly looked sending farewell space true friend deliverer whose eyes knew well watched flight whose heart went 
traveled sadly wondering plan escape sihamba spoken stood corpse put practice wondering also meet 
third time turned dead woman rock tiny point white altogether vanished away 
suzanne halted pressed steadily towards saw edged spur reached twelve clock grass tall untrodden veldt rough sun hot weak felt grief effects thirst laden heavy child progress slow 
length however stood gasping shadow gazing dismayed huge range mountains steep rough cliffs must climb 
never shall cross without foot weighted child end must die thought suzanne sank banks little rivulet resting swollen feet cool stream indeed weeks seemed could never enough taste smell feel water 
sat thus striving still wailing hungry boy suddenly shadow man fell upon 
cry sprang feet find face face zinti 
oh thought taken exclaimed 
lady escaped crossed plain far left seemed better seen traveling together mountain 
let us eat eaten little many days lacking water wash food large skin wallet bore zinti drew dried flesh roasted corn 
suzanne looked food longing touched took corn pounded pulp stone mixed water fed child devoured stuff greedily presently fell asleep 
ate much wanted since zinti carried enough three meals never suzanne take meat greater relish 
afterwards though yearned sleep pressed zinti said safe stay since long van vooren would seeking far wide chanced discover secret flight would travel one hour horseback could four foot 
went forward pass much refreshed zinti carrying child 
day long walked thus resting intervals till sunset reached crest pass saw wide plains natal stretched like map beneath far away near banks river wound feet white topped koppie beneath said zinti boer camp 
suzanne sat looked yes caps waggons gleamed fading light oh heart leapt sight waggons white men women seen years length would safe 
even breast heaved thought icy unnatural wind seemed stir hair sudden felt seemed feel presence sihamba 
moment one gone life ever come back 
oh sihamba dead cried 
zinti looked question 
may well said sadly pray best chieftainesses 
least lives save let us go pressed forward gathering gloom 
soon grew dark guide man zinti suzanne must stopped till moon rose midnight 
zinti could find path feet trod even dark yes although ran piled rocks mountain side cut course streams must forded 
wading one rivulets suzanne struck bare ankle stone lamed time forward shivering wet water hurt sharp sudden fallen stream forced walk leaning zinti shoulder indeed rough places obliged carry 
zinti wished abandon heavy child strong though weight two proved almost could bear suzanne would listen 
nay said child sent heaven saved shame death shame death portion leave live 
go alone zinti stay child 
truly white people strange answered zinti wish burden child another lives stake lady struggled forward best could carrying one supporting 
thus hour hour slowly crept onward stars light guide till length midnight moon rose saw near foot mountain 
rested awhile long enough grow stiff hastening slope reached plain headed white topped koppie shone moonlight six miles away 
crept suzanne limping painfully ankle begun swell crawling upon hands knees zinti longer strength carry child 
thus covered three miles perhaps many hours 
last something like sob suzanne sank earth 
zinti walk said 
either must rest die 
looked saw spoke truth quite outworn 
said must stay till morning think take hurt bull head scarcely care cross pass night 
suzanne shook head answered begun climb rising moon 
hear zinti 
boer camp close still strength left take child go gained entrance way tell plight ride save 
good thought said lady like leave alone since place hide 
could help stayed zinti therefore go sooner gone sooner shall rescued 
hear command lady answered given food left fastened sleeping child upon shoulder walked forward rise 
something less hour zinti came camp formed unlaagered waggons tents pitched foot koppie along one base ran river 
fifty yards front camp stood single buck waggon near sill glowed embers cooking fire 
try pass waggon watch shoot thought zinti though indeed need fear camp kaffirs slept soundly 
knowing however stood distance called aloud till last hottentot crept gun throwing back blanket head asked wanted 
want see baas camp answered mistress white woman lies exhausted upon veldt far away seeks help 
want see baas yawned man must wait till daylight wakes 
wait answered zinti made though pass towards camp whereupon man raised gun covered saying go shoot stray kaffir dogs allowed prowl camp night 
must asked zinti 
go away may sit waggon till light boers masters wake tell story believe nothing 
choice zinti sat waggon waited man gun watched pretending asleep 
suzanne left alone upon great veldt fear took hold broken body mind place desolate also dreaded lest lions take could hear roaring distance swart piet worse lion 
still weary washing face hands spring close presently fell asleep 
awoke east tinged first gray light coming dawn seemed though cold hand fear gripped heart sudden aroused heavy sleep 
sound caused look crest rise three hundred yards away saw dark forms moving caught sight spears glimmered moonlight 
end thought suzanne without doubt yonder stands zulu impi attacked umpondwana see crane feathers head dresses crouched upon ground extremity dread 
chapter xxxiii ralph finds dream mountain must go back evening learned great tidings lips lad gaasha whose life ralph saved attack kaffirs upon laager 
sat gaasha ground staring far away ralph lying swoon jan looked like people suddenly beheld sign heaven 
evil magic words said gaasha presently strike baas yonder dead like spear dead answered long sought mountain umpondwana speak 
tell us hear white woman dwelling chieftainess sihamba lady heard none 
answer gaasha saddened made sure strange thing happened white woman come live among tribe man told return sihamba would told also 
therefore argued either suzanne dead power piet van vooren sihamba deserted though last believe 
turned afterwards gaasha stupidest kaffirs saved long days doubt trouble though heard sihamba accompanied white woman heard brought white bird mountain umpondwana 
course told us guessed white bird could none suzanne whose native name swallow 
well set reviving ralph done throwing water face 
found senses prayed suffer carried away hope since although gaasha heard sihamba heard nothing suzanne 
answered god pointed mountain vision strange manner fear would find wife upon since god merciful desire mock torment servants 
replied trusted might ways almighty beyond understanding become us pass judgment upon 
ralph scarcely heeded words springing feet said come let us going mountain umpondwana 
first must consult commandant get aid said jan would safe wander wild places alone many kaffirs doubtless would murder us 
eagerness ralph would listen desired start 
pointed horses dead sickness moreover night dark could trek till moon rose length consented 
went laager jan called older men together quiet place 
heer botmar asked commandant assembled 
cousin said jan desire ask go three days trek march mountain called umpondwana whither servant mine gaasha guide 
reason asked commandant astonished 
friend said jan heard story outcast devil piet van vooren stole away child suzanne wife ralph kenzie englishman 
old tale said commandant doubtless poor girl dead long ago speak request trek mountain umpondwana cousin think daughter suzanne living among kaffirs seek rescue 
least certain learned lips gaasha sihamba friend servant believe rules tribe chieftainess 
may said commandant gaasha tell daughter also answered jan 
know jan hesitated turned red replied know ralph kenzie saw mountain vision two years ago vision told would find wife taken marriage day 
hearing boers broke laughing though religious people place faith visions 
thereupon grew angry spoke strongly perhaps done reducing silence little afraid tongue 
also told story dream ralph passed gaasha showing imagined 
done ralph spoke also saying friends doubtless tale sounds foolish ears ask nickname among man mountain always spoken inquired certain mountain ridges shaped like fingers man hand thought mad reason heard mountain heard also sihamba wife rules chieftainess 
strange therefore believing ever vision wish visit mountain sure shall find wife lost boers laughed consulted apart till last elder heer celliers spoke 
heeren botmar kenzie said story vision say little 
aught know may true true work magic nothing 
wish go seek mountain umpondwana must go alone alter plans trek 
counsel go since good come visions magic 
heard answered back jan ralph went away presently found talking together outside laager 
let go alone ralph saying

indeed become asked 
vrouw stop neighbors join natal 
thing jan botmar answered two go go 
sick also love daughter anxious learn fate wife answered jan perhaps well three separate together always went see waggon 
soon moon rose eleven clock oxen inspanned 
started however several friends came praying us venture perilous journey indeed threatened even use force prevent us think would done jan told outright masters free go wished 
departed grieving obstinacy little guessing danger far greater since chanced trekked van reenen pass days later zulu impi returning weenen massacres fell upon unawares killed half number beaten 
trekked moon gaasha guiding us outspan till dawn 
said horses never made journey come home slow oxen never hurry indeed since time 
englishmen always hurry one reasons boers superior choose master everything except shopkeeping especially fighting 
well best cattle could drag waggon roadless veldt greater rate two miles hour cover twenty miles day 
pitiful see ralph impatience walked returned indeed allowed think would pressed forward foot leaving us follow waggon 
daylight third day inspanned usual trekked morning mists sun sucked 
gaasha sitting waggon box beside ralph touched shoulder pointed 
ralph looked far away upon plain saw seemed white cloud towered flat cliffs mountain red rock 
see baas said yonder umpondwana home nightfall shall know whether parents still alive dead whether left cattle claim law began whistle cheerfully 
said ralph aloud shall know whether life heaven hell day long neither eating drinking sat upon waggon box stared mountain lifting eyes 
one clock afternoon seemed quite close green flanks umpondwana sudden cut wide spoor trampled thousands naked feet 
jan gaasha got waggon examine ralph move 
impi passed said jan presently 
yes zulu impi think baas one whole day ago gaasha began hunt amongst low bushes grew near trail
