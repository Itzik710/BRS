discovery science comes steps 
traced back steps another scientist 
suppose confronted result apparently produced without preliminaries 
would guess concerning ross stared major 
although see time jumping sensed kelgarries waiting serious answer somehow ross would judged reply 
either steps kept strictly secret said slowly result rightfully belong man said discovered 
first time major regarded approval 
suppose discovery vital life would try find source within past five years friends across way come three discoveries 
one able trace duplicate use refinements 
two remain rootless yet linked first 
attempting solve problem time grows late 
reason though reds super super gadgets yet ready use 
sometimes things work sometimes fail 
everything points fact reds experimenting discoveries basically get another world ross imagination came life 
successful space voyage kept secret contact made another intelligent race way another world world time space 
seven years ago got man east berlin 
almost dead lived long enough record tape amazing data wild almost dismissed ravings delirium 
sputnik dare disregard hints side iron curtain 
recording turned scientists proved core truth 
time travel written fiction discussed otherwise impossibility 
discover reds working mean go future bring back machines use 
major shook head 
future past 
elaborate joke somewhat heatedly ross snapped answer 
look know education big brains know farther back go history simpler things 
ride cars hundred years ago men drove horses 
guns go back little find waving swords shooting guys bows arrows wear tin plate stop punctured commented ashe 
look agincourt lad remember arrows french knights armor 
ross disregarded interruption 
anyway stuck doggedly point farther back go simpler things 
reds going find anything history beat today point baffled us several years major returned 
going find 
somewhere past world contacted civilization able produce weapons ideas advanced baffle experts 
find source either mine close 
yet still trying find 
ross shook head 
must long way back 
guys discover tombs dig old cities give hints civilization like left something could find today depends ashe remarked upon type civilization 
egyptians built stone grandly

lain rest wakened feet heading back compulsion power take body waking guard 
rested dared sleep desire constantly tearing striving take weakened body draw back 
perhaps reason believed aliens trying control 
ross even venture guess determined get 
tribesmen trail well know sure purely war wills 
banks river giving way marshes wade mud water detouring boggy sections 
great clouds birds whirled shrieked protests coming sleek water animals paddled poked curious heads water two legged thing walked mechanically green land 
always pull ross aware fighting traveling 
want return follow afraid venture far come transfer yet unseen rope tugging grow less tenuous put distance mountain valley 
ross could understand neither motives methods could continue fight 
bog endless 
found island lashed suit belt single willow grew knowing must sleep could hope last next day 
slept waken cold shaking afraid 
shoulder deep pool aware sleep must opened belt buckle freed mishap falling water brought around sanity 
somehow got back tree rehooked buckle twisted belt around branches sure could work free daybreak 
lapsed deepening doze awoke still safely anchored morning cries birds 
ross considered suit untangled belt 
could strange clothing tie aliens held strip leaving garment behind would safe tried force open studs across chest would yield slight pressure seared fingers could exert pulled fabric unable tear 
still wearing livery world men ross continued way hardly caring went 
mud plastered frequent falls protection swarm insect life passing stirred attack 
however able endure swollen face slitted eyes far conscious wrenching feeling within misery body 
character marsh began change 
river splitting dozen smaller streams shaping fanlike 
looking one marsh hillocks ross knew faint surge relief 
place map ashe made memorize 
close sea last moment enough 
salt sharpened wind cut force fist face 
absence sunlight leaden clouds overhead set winterlike gloom across countryside 
constant sound birdcalls ross tramped heavily small pools beating path tangles marsh grass 
stole eggs nests sucking nourishment eagerly dislike fishy flavor drinking stagnant brackish ponds 
suddenly ross halted first thinking continuous roll sound heard thunder 
yet clouds overhead massed sign lightning 
continuing realized mysterious sound pounding surf near sea willing body run weaved forward reeling trot pitting energy incessant pull behind 
feet skidded marsh mud sand 
ahead dark rocks surrounded white lace spray 
ross headed straight toward spray stood knee deep curling foam edged water felt tug body almost strong tug upon mind 
knelt letting salt water sting life every cut every burn sputtering filled mouth nostrils washing slime bog lands 
cold bitter sea made ross murdock staggered back sat suddenly sand 
glancing saw refuge rough triangle two small river arms littered debris spring floods grounded rejection sea 
although plenty material fire means kindling flame lost flint beaker traders carried purpose 
sea odds reached 
lay back self confidence restored point dared consider future 
watched swooping flight gulls drawing patterns clouds 
moment wanted nothing lie rest 
surrender first demand driven body long 
hungry cold sure storm coming knew build fire fire shore could provide means signaling sub 
hardly knowing one part coastline good another ross began walk threading path among rocky outcrops 
found hollow two windbreaks within blackened circle small stones holding charred wood empty shells piled near 
unmistakable evidence camp ross plunged forward thrusting hand impetuously black mass dead fire 
astonishment touched warmth hardly daring disturb precious bits charcoal dug around carefully blew appeared dead ashes 
answering glow could imagined 
pile wood left behind ross snatched small twig poking coal rubbed brush rough rock 
watched one ache hope 
twig caught stiff fingers clumsy careful ross learned patience hard school 
bit bit fed tiny blaze real fire 
leaning back rock watched 
obvious placement original fire chosen care outcrops gave wind shelter 
also provided dark backdrop partially hiding flames landward side undoubtedly making visible sea 
site seemed right signal fire ross hands shook slightly fed blaze 
clear anyone would make signal shore 
mcneil perhaps ashe survived breakup raft 
reached point abandoned earlier morning judging life remaining coals put signal 
arranged collected sub way back hidden north american post 
hope pickup 
believed dead found rag sapling must thought finished fall river 
hours late ross folded arms across hunched knees rested head 
possible way could ever reach post kind ever 
thousands miles lay temporary installation time 
sunk complete despair long unaware finally free pressure turn back long haunted 
roused feed fire got wondering 
hunted given chase since lost race time really care 
matter pile wood getting low decided matter either 
even ross got feet moving drifts storm wrack gather 
stay useless beacon somehow could force move futile vigil seemed 
dragging sun dried bleached limbs long dead trees half shelter piled working laughed barricade built 
siege first time days spoke aloud 
might ready siege pulled another branch added pile kneeled flames 
fisherfolk found along coast tomorrow rested would strike south try find one primitive villages 
traders would coming territory red inspired raiders gone

beaker trader agent project one thing live role rest life something else 
ross stood fire staring sea sign knew would never see long lived 
spear struck shoulder blades attacked 
blow physical came instead tearing red pain head pressure terrible could move 
knew instantly behind lurked ultimate danger 
chapter ross fought break hold turn head face peril crept upon 
unlike anything ever met short lifetime could come alien source 
strange encounter battle rebellion authority ruled boyhood pushed orbit project stiffened meet attack 
going turn head going see stood 
inch inch ross head came around though sweat stung seared bitten flesh every breath effort 
caught half glimpse beach behind rocks stretch sand empty 
overhead birds gone never existed 
swept away impatient fighter wanted distractions purpose hand 
successfully turned head ross decided turn body 
left hand went slowly moved great weight 
palm gritted painfully rock savored pain pierced dead blanket compulsion used 
deliberately ground blistered skin stone concentrating sharp torment hand agony shot arm 
focused attention physical pain could feel pressure weaken 
summoning strength ross swung around movement shadow former feline grace 
beach still empty except piles driftwood rocks things originally found 
yet knew something waiting pounce 
discovered pain defense weapon one resource 
took would besting fight 
even made decision ross conscious curious weakening force bent upon 
opponents surprised either simple actions past seconds determination 
ross leaped upon surprise adding stock unseen weapons 
leaned forward still grinding torn hand rock steadying influence took length dried wood thrust end fire 
used fire save ready willing although time another part shrank intended 
holding improvised torch breast high ross stared across searching land faintest sign enemies 
spite fire light held dusk prevented seeing far 
behind crash surf could covered noise marching army 
come get whirled brand bursting life hurled straight drift among dunes 
grabbing second brand almost blazing head first fallen twisted bleached roots dead tree 
stood tense second torch kindled hand 
sharp vise another nipped tightly moment ago easing slowly disappearing water might trickle away 
yet could believe small act defiance daunted unseen opponent make give struggle easily 
likely pause wrestler seeking deadlier grip 
brand hand ross second line defense weapon loath use would use forced 
kept hand mercilessly flat rock reminder spur 
fire twisted crackled among driftwood first torch lodged providing flickering light yards stood 
grateful gloom gathering storm 
would come open war rain struck ross sheltered torch body spray driven inward sea spattered shoulders back 
rained would lose small advantage fire gave would find way meet 
would neither break take even wade sea swim lash cold northern waves could move tired limbs longer 
steel edge struck ross probing stubbornness assaulting mind 
whirled torch brought scorching breath flame across hand resting rock 
unable control cry protest sure fortitude repeat act 
pressure fallen away flick almost current snapped 
red curtain torment ross sensed surprise disbelief 
unaware queer duel using power depth perception never known possessed 
daring shaken opponents physical attack could affected 
come get shouted barren shoreline fire ate drift nothing stirred yet something much alive conscious lay hidden 
time simple challenge ross demand note triumph 
spray whipped striking fire brand held 
let sea water put would find another way fighting 
certain sensed knew troubled 
fire driven wind along crisscross lines bone white wood left high beach forming wall flame interior however insurmountable barrier whatever lurked 
ross leaned rock studying length beach 
wrong thinking within range voice power used might carry greater distance 
yahhhh instead demand voiced taunting cry screaming defiance 
wild madness transmitted winds roaring sea pain 
ready face worst could send tried hurl thought back struck united 
answer came challenge rise counter attack 
moving away rock ross began walk forward toward burning drift torch ready hand 
shouted wind 
come face saw tracked 
two tall thin figures wearing dark clothes standing quietly watching eyes dark holes white ovals faces 
ross halted 
though separated yards sand rock burning barrier could feel force wielded 
nature force changed however 
struck vigorous spear point formed shield protection 
ross could break shield dared drop 
stalemate existed strange battle like ross world known 
watched expressionless white faces trying find reply deadlock 
flashed mind certainty lived moved lived moved struggle unending pursuit would continue 
mysterious reason wanted control never going happen remain strip water washed sand starved death ross tried drive thought across 
murrrrdock croaking cry borne sea wind might almost come bill sea bird 
murrrrdock ross spun around 
visibility drastically curtailed lowering clouds dashing spray could see round dark thing bobbing waves 
sub raft sensing movement behind ross wheeled one alien figures leaped blazing drift heedless flames ran light footedly toward could attempt capture 
man ready weapon like one felled foscar 
ross threw opponent reckless dive falling smashing impact 
ross grasp alien body fragile moved fluidly murdock fought break grip hand weapon pin sand 
ross intent upon part struggle heed sounds shot head thin wailing cry 
slammed opponent hand stone white face inches away twisted silently pain 
fumbling better hold ross sent rolling 
came left hand force brought tears eyes stopped long enough regain feet 
blue suited man sprinted back body fellow lay drift 
slung unconscious comrade barrier ease ross would believed possible vaulted barrier 
ross half crouched sand felt unusually light empty 
strange tie drawn held strangers broken 
murdock rubber raft rode waves two men aboard
