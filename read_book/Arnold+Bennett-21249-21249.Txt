good nature could refuse nothing sort compulsion 
edwin got first call though way remarkable triumphs pillow 
twenty five minutes later crossing trafalgar road entering school yard wesleyan chapel

six clock nothing 
young men debating society newly formed branch multifarous activity wesleyan methodist chapel 
met sunday sunday day would suit everybody six morning two reasons 
obvious reason hour meetings would clash either activities solemnity sabbath meals 
obvious reason could stood secretly supported recondite reason preposterous hour appealed powerfully something youthful perverse silly fanatical fine youths 
discovered ascetic joy robbing sleep catching chills disturbing households chapel keepers 
thought great thing discussing intellectual topics hour town ignorantly scorned intellectuality snoring heavy brutishness 
great thing 
considered salt earth part earth 
idea 
edwin joined society partly possess art refusing partly notion appealed spectacularly martyr partly gave excuse ceasing attend afternoon sunday school loathed 
without excuse could never told father meant give sunday school 
could never dared

edwin stammeringly hesitatingly gave preliminary sketch life censured convocation deposed see metropolitan privy council decided deposition null void ecclesiastical authorities circumvented privy council refusing pay salary bishop edwin considered mean bishop circumvented ecclesiastical authorities appealing master rolls ordered ecclesiastical authorities pay arrears income interest thereon unless ready bring trial heresy said authorities would bring trial heresy edwin considered miserable cowardice part bishop publicly excommunicated without authority friends among respectable powerful people made present three thousand pounds 
graphic historical survey edwin proceeded pentateuchal puzzles without pronouncing opinion thereon argued commentator learned sincere must force good bible nothing fear honest inquiry etcetera etcetera 
five sixths speech colored phrases modes thought picked wesleyan community sixth belonged 
speech moderately bad inferior many speeches 
received absolute silence 
rather surprised edwin tone leading members society usually spoke indicated reasons knew regarded superior intellect indeed edwin entirely ashamed quality speech fact feared worse especially since walk mr orgreave quite unable concentrate thoughts bishop colenso exceedingly unhappy apprehensive concerning affair bore kind relation pentateuch

chairman began speak 
function call upon speakers order arranged sum putting resolution vote 
produced surprisingly speech 
reminded meeting bishop colenso memorialised archbishop canterbury compelling natives already one wife renounce polygamy condition baptism christian religion stated though young men present almost infants arms period part could well remember episode particular bishop colenso amazing allegation could find disapproval polygamy either bible writings ancient church
