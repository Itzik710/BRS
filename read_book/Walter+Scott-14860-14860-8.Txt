comparing notes moore confirmed one two points always laid considering poor byron 
one like rousseau apt suspicious plain downright steadiness manner true mode maintain good opinion 
rose told sitting byron fixed insensibly eyes feet one must remembered deformed 
looking suddenly saw byron regarding look concentrated deep displeasure wore observed consciousness embarrassment countenance rose 
murray afterwards explained telling rose lord byron jealous personal imperfection noticed attended 
another point moore confirmed previous opinion namely byron loved mischief making 
moore written cautioning project establishing paper called liberal communion men pb shelley hunt said world set mark 
byron showed parties 
shelley wrote modest rather affecting expostulation moore 
two peculiarities extreme suspicion love mischief shades malady certainly tinctured part character mighty genius without tendency towards genius mean kind depends imaginative power perhaps exist great extent 
wheels machine play rapidly must fit utmost exactness else attrition diminishes impetus 
another byron peculiarities love mystifying indeed may referred mischief 
knowing much little believe narratives 
instance mr bankes expostulating upon dedication written extravagant terms praise cam hobhouse byron told cam teased dedication till said well shall providing write dedication affirmed cam hobhouse write high colored dedication accordingly 
mentioned murray report rose bankes mentioned 
murray reply assured dedication written lord byron showed hand 
wrote rose mention thing bankes might made mischief story got circle 
byron disposed think men imagination addicted mix fiction poetry prose 
used say dared believe celebrated courtezan venice rousseau makes piquante story one could see draggle tailed wench enough 
believe embellished amours considerably many respects le fanfaron de vices qu il n avoit pas 
loved thought awful mysterious gloomy sometimes hinted strange causes 
believe whole creation sport wild powerful fancy

constable lame duck upon legs heart courage firm cock 
convinced well support london house
