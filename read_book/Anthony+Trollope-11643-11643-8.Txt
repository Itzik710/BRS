rumored constant books man always constant books also never seen shed tear heard speak taken 
truth stout self constraining man silent unless something say 
could become loud enough perhaps might said eloquent 
wife inwardly affectionate outwardly almost stern 
daughters always anxious every good thing behalf never able make children conscious anxiety 
taken suffered silence men suffer suffered knew well little gentleness manners 
hoped sat alone desolate house would different son son thing left 
son boy look forward years might bring rather present happiness source 
boy came home holidays father would sometimes walk discourse certain chosen subjects politics day regard mr caldigate advanced liberal abomination game laws folly protection antiquated absurdity state church matters son john lent inattentive ear

lad could awakened enthusiasm abuse conservative leaders 
babingtons fools despised whole race especially thick legged romping cherry cheeked damsels doubt son would marry one 
earth earthy without idea among 
yet dare forbid son go house lest people say sternness unendurable 
folking place many attractions beyond rats

denied property done good loud declaring entail done property lived much harm 
hearts hearts feel desire gone acres still belong caldigate 
much leaven old english squirarchic aristocracy create pride fact caldigates folking three hundred years wish might remain doubt knew without repeated entails would remained 
still hated thing years rolled came think entail existing would especial evil

fast friends quarter century arrangement terms present squire son left mr bolton 
mr bolton doubt received unfavourable account young man 
men mr bolton make money lending recognized rates interest generally keen looking principal mercy whatsoever davises creation little customers

banker particularly attached theory primogeniture 
divided wealth equally sons 
strong idea property rights 
young man claim folking father death valid father claim life 
doubt severance entail made would made accordance young man wishes certain terms declared persons able compute value rights

cousin julia aunt polly enemies necessary assume whatever weapons might come hand 
arranged stay week babington 
considered deeply felt two days least fraction time could propriety devote shands must give least week babington 
therefore necessity immediate violence part ladies 
whole week might probably allowed pass without absolute violence shown various ways intend make many visits old haunts childhood return australia 
said hunt coming winter feared hand shooting idea traveling continent autumn knowing might summoned back polyeuka course came across aunt polly mind probably also across julia mind idea meant give slip 
former occasion behaved badly

mrs nicholas mrs bolton might suited might congenial comfort elder son elder son wife endeavored prevent old man second marriage never thorough reconciliation since 
people never forgive 
mrs nicholas never forgiven young girl marrying old man young girl never forgiven opposition elder step daughter law marriage 
hence come pass nicholases extruded family conclaves generally consisted daniels roberts

objection stronger may taken amounting almost encouragement circumstances 
paid evident attention caldigate said pecuniary affairs going far say condition declare whether would give daughter fortune marriage 
quite unnecessary said caldigate 
probably something death rejoined old man 
may see asked caldigate 
answer mr bolton would first make suggestion whatsoever falling back upon old fears declaring could meetings last allowing lover discuss matter son robert 
perhaps may mistaken young man caldigate banker said wife night 
oh nicholas say perhaps may mistaken 
thinking hester said nothing hester perhaps may mistaken opinion young man john caldigate 
john caldigate rode home interview bank almost felt cleared away many difficulties perseverance might probably enabled carry dream earlier youth

sweet news hester first heard come pass agreed marriage postponed till return one concession made mrs bolton 
many arguments hester last told promised much mother would course keep promise 
arrangement took form journey necessary perhaps objection journey became strong caldigate mind determined dispense price 
thus greatly dismay mrs bolton suddenly came reason married almost 
attempt made picking holes rather many attempts

days made visits babington 
came plaintive little note mrs shand

barrister shook head 
mean say nothing done exclaimed mrs bolton rising seat steps taken perhaps could prevent return whispered barrister 
persuade go back suggested mrs daniel 
well might come time

mrs bolton seemed declare face would quite impossible increase enmity 
lock said old man 
practically 
take bonnet away whatever came 
let vehicle carry back 
let keys turned necessary 
servants must know course probably side 
mean say resolute escape cost prevent 
probably resolute like 
requires deal resolution young woman show streets alone wretched plight 
depends disposition 
determined said hester mother 
equally 
assertion mrs bolton assented little nod 
try 
one cases unfortunately publicity avoided 
best poor dear according conscience 
induce come visit mother possible detain 
thus william bolton gave advice robert bolton assented determined line action 
said either cruel unloving projected scheme 
believing man husband must admitted duty take away possible 
probable hester would look upon care light 
would beat bars cage even prevented escaping motives reasons william bolton suggested would less regard father mother wicked tyrants 
mother understood well 
though hard world besides never hard girl 
tenderest female bosom ever panted injustice done offspring full pity love desire 
save hester sin suffering would willingly lay life 
knew carrying scheme proposed must appear girl enemy bitterest enemies seen mother force open convulsively closed jaws child order agonising torture might applied though agonising would tend save sick infant life 
though child shrank torturing fiend 
mother resolved would though child learn hate 
william bolton undertook go folking give invitation allured come puritan grange day night longer absence objectionable morning visit could achieved 
treachery falsehood certain evil possible good might come 
hate ever yet ought done said william bolton good man excellent husband father regarded profession honorable trustworthy man 
never stay old man said wife others gone two left together 
know 
sure never stay 
try 
mrs robert said thing scheme explained 
think anybody could keep prisoner unless locked cell think would scream husband endeavored explain screaming might depend causes produced coercion 
think would scream scream till let loose person locking nothing justify 
felt world would would scream would let 
mrs robert however seemed think one could keep house without positive bolts bars chains 
meantime much settled folking settled cambridge details known folking 
mr seely taken case course gone much minuteness robert bolton done 
caldigate owned writing envelope writing letter declared letter sent envelope 
written envelope foolish joke ahalala remembered well quite sure never passed sydney post office 
letter written sydney 
remembered writing also remembered posting sydney envelope addressed mrs smith 
mr seely assured seen post office stamp sydney cover caldigate declared must passed post office fraudulent purposes left hands 
said mr seely fraud must meditated prepared three years ago hardly probable 
letter clergyman allan mr seely procured copy caldigate declared certainly never addressed 
never received letter mr allan never seen man handwriting 
quite sure new south wales could get dozen people swear never marriage ahalala 
name many people especially dick shand 
mr seely proposed send agent colony take depositions witnesses could find possible bring dick shand back 
whatever cost search made mr allan mr allan found brought england money could bring 
mr allan could found document written might perhaps obtained reference handwriting
