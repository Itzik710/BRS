one long plume blossoms touched lightly soft golden brown coils girl hair cast wavering shadow beautiful flower like face beneath 
esterbrook elliott standing thought proudly never seen woman might compare 
every detail satisfied critical fastidious taste 
discordant touch 
esterbrook elliott always loved marian lesley thought

marian father decreed positive pledge pass marian twenty one 
esterbrook accepted mapped destiny selected bride conviction exceptionally lucky fellow 
women world marian one would chosen mistress fine old home 
boyhood ideal 
believed loved sincerely much love blind worldly advantages marriage cousin 
father died two years previously leaving wealthy independent 
marian lost mother childhood father died eighteen 
since lived alone aunt 
life quiet lonely 
esterbrook companionship brightened enough 
marian lavished rich womanly love heart 
twenty first birthday formally betrothed 
married following autumn 
shadow drifted across heaven happiness 
believed secure lover unfaltering devotion 
true times thought manner lacked lover passionate ardor 
always attentive courteous 
utter wish find anticipated spent every spare minute side 
yet sometimes half wished would betray lover like impatience intensity 
lovers calm undemonstrative reproached incipient disloyalty often vexingly intruded unwelcome presence across inner consciousness 
surely esterbrook fond devoted enough satisfy exacting demands affection 
marian somewhat undemonstrative reserved 
passing acquaintances called cold proud 
privileged knew rich depths womanly tenderness nature 
esterbrook thought fully appreciated 
walked homeward night betrothal reviewed unconscious criticism mental catalogue marian graces good qualities admitting supreme satisfaction one thing could wish changed 
afternoon acacias planning wedding 
one consult

esterbrook mapped details bridal tour careful thoughtfulness 
would visit old world places marian wished see 
afterwards would come back home 
discussed certain changes wished make old elliott mansion fit young beautiful mistress 
planning

esterbrook said softly

negative sort goodness fear 
never tried tempted severely 
perhaps fail test 
sure would answered marian proudly 
esterbrook laughed faith pleasant 
thought would prove worthy 
cove called little fishing hamlet situated low sandy shore small bay 
houses clustered one spot seemed like nothing much larger shells washed sea gray bleached long exposure sea winds spray 
dozens ragged children playing mingled several disreputable yellow curs yapped noisily strangers 
sandy strip beach houses groups men lounging 
mackerel season yet set spring herring netting past 
holiday time among sea folks 
enjoying full happy ragged colony careless morrows might bring forth 
beyond boats anchor floating gracefully twinkling water sea birds tall masts bowing landward swell 
lazy dreamful calm fallen distant seas horizon blues pale dim faint purple hazes blurred outlines far headlands cliffs yellow sands sparkled sunshine powdered jewels 
murmurous babble life buzzed hamlet pierced shrill undertones wrangling children paused play scan visitors covert curiosity 
marian led way house apart others edge shelving rock 
dooryard scrupulously clean unlittered little footpath neatly bordered white clam shells several thrifty geraniums bloom looked muslin curtained windows 
weary faced woman came forward meet 
bessie much miss lesley said answer marian inquiry 
doctor sent today could 
seemed quite hopeful 
complain nothing lies moans 
sometimes gets restless 
kind come often miss lesley 
magdalen put basket lady brought shelf girl sitting unnoticed back visitors head child cot one corner room stood slowly turned around 
marian esterbrook elliott started involuntary surprise 
esterbrook caught breath like man suddenly awakened sleep 
name wonderful could girl little harmony surroundings standing crepuscular light corner marvellous beauty shone vivid richness rare painting 
tall magnificent proportions figure enhanced rather marred severely plain dress dark print wore 
heavy masses hair shining auburn dashed golden foam coiled rich glossy knot back classically modelled head rippled back low brow whose waxen fairness even breezes ocean spared 
girl face full perfect oval features faultless regularity large full eyes tawny hazel darkened inscrutable gloom dimness corner 
even marian lesley face delicately tinted trace color appeared smooth marble like cheeks yet waxen pallor bore trace disease weakness large curving mouth intense crimson 
stood quite motionless 
trace embarrassment self consciousness pose 
mrs barrett said niece magdalen crawford merely inclined head grave silent acknowledgement 
moved forward take marian basket seemed oddly place low crowded room 
presence seemed throw strange restraint group 
marian rose went cot laying slender hand hot forehead little sufferer 
child opened brown eyes questioningly 
today bessie mad len want mad len moaned little plaintive voice 
magdalen came stood beside marian lesley 
wants said low thrilling voice free harsh accent intonation 
one seems know always 
yes darling mad len right beside 
leave 
knelt little cot passed arm child neck drawing curly head close throat tender soothing motion 
esterbrook elliott watched two women intently one standing cot arrayed simple yet costly apparel beautiful high bred face kneeling bare sanded floor print dress splendid head bent low child long fringe burnished lashes sweeping cold pallor oval cheek 
moment magdalen crawford haunting eyes looked straight one fleeting second unnamable thrill pain pleasure stirred heart thrill strong sudden passionate face paled emotion room seemed swim eyes mist gleamed wonderful face mesmeric darkly radiant eyes burning way deeps abysses soul hitherto unknown 
mist cleared away head grew steadier wondered 
yet trembled every limb clear idea struggled confused thoughts overmastering desire take cold face hands kiss passionless marble glowed warm throbbing life 
girl said abruptly left cottage 
beautiful woman ever seen present company always excepted concluded depreciatory laugh 
delicate bloom marian face deepened slightly 
much better omitted last sentence said quietly palpably afterthought 
yes wonderfully lovely strange beauty fancied 
seemed something odd uncanny 
must mrs barrett niece 
remember month ago mrs barrett told expected niece live time least 
parents dead father died recently 
mrs barrett seemed troubled 
said girl well brought used better things cove could give feared would discontented unhappy 
forgotten saw girl today 
certainly seems superior person find cove lonely sure 
probable stay long 
must see manner seemed rather repellent think hardly responded esterbrook curtly 
seemed surprisingly dignified self possessed fancied girl position 
princess could looked bowed royally 
shadow embarrassment manner spite incongruity surroundings 
much better leave alone marian 
probability would resent condescension part 
wonderful deep lovely eyes 
sensitive color flushed marian cheek voice lapsed unconsciously dreamy retrospective tone slight restraint came manner depart 
esterbrook went away sunset 
marian asked remain evening pleaded excuse 
shall come tomorrow afternoon said stooped drop careless good bye kiss face 
marian watched wistfully rode away unaccountable pain heart 
felt acutely ever depths lover nature powerless stir responsive life 
power thought girl cove deep eyes wonderful face 
chill premonitory fear seized upon 
feel exactly esterbrook gone away forever said slowly stooping brush cheek dew cold milk white acacia bloom would never come back 
could happen wonder would left live esterbrook elliott meant honestly thought meant go home left marian 
nevertheless reached road branching cove turned horse flush dark cheek 
realized motive action disloyal marian felt ashamed weakness 
desire see magdalen crawford look depths eyes stronger else overpowered every throb duty resistance 
saw nothing reached cove

helen good girl ways little obstinate sulky generally steady enough work girl bay beach come house field 
angus calculates saves man wages clear 
got nothing say helen 
nevertheless reeves felt somehow mrs fraser like husband niece 
often heard scolding nagging helen work noticed latter never answered back 
mrs angus tongue especially bitter met girl hurrying along hall kitchen eyes full tears 
reeves felt someone struck blow
