want offer new idea raf 
truly want city people offer caught pilot 
could remember unusual distinctness disliked somehow feared things brought city storehouse privately hoped hobart lablet would content let well enough alone bring knowledge alien race back 
secretly known aversion would able destroy globe treasures piled 
protest hot angry much 
calm question sank mind might stone troubled pool ripples passing changed idea two 
wish might see homeport 
perhaps would easier understand 
knowledge corrupt would carry seeds disaster others 
would easy us accept walk softer road forget far 
give us time raf cupped palms watering eyes 
wanted badly see clearly face able read expression 
yet seemed somehow able see sober face sincere words mind 
come dalgard said certainty 
shall waiting raf kurbi made possible 
something solemn raf looked surprise 
destroyed core holding gave us chance 
done mermen harmless happy creatures world would wiped 
would new beginning dark horrible end 
raf blinked surprise figure standing direct sunlight waver beyond proudly held head stretch turquoise sky 
could see color yes shall see eyes mind dalgard spoke aloud 
spirit rules space kind shall return people 
served cause well 
embarrassed solemnity dalgard ended prosaic inquiry would like shellfish eating moments later wading water swirled sand boots kicked toes feeling elusive shelled creatures one could see raf felt happier freer could ever remember 
going right 
could see would find ship laughed aloud nothing heard answering chuckle whoop triumph scout stooping claw one prey hiding 
eaten dalgard asked another question one seem important raf 
close friend among crew ship raf hesitated 
obliged consider point friends let alone close one among crew rs certainly claim wonstead shared quarters honestly care never saw 
officers experts lablet quickly face character swept mind swiftly discarded 
soriki could claim com tech special friend least period together among aliens come know better 
dalgard read mind probably thought raf flash old resentment another question 
like though pilot could see little reason answered best could trying build first physical picture com tech little guessing lay space burned skin 
dalgard lay back gazing blue green sky 
yet raf knew intent every word 
merman padded settled cross legged beside scout enthralled pilot halting description man might never see 
second sea people came third raf felt sort noiseless council progress 
words trailed away dalgard offered explanation 
take us many many days reach place ship 
able complete journey friends may gone 
shall try something else aid 
raf fingered little bundle possessions 
even helmet com phone missing 
dalgard read mind 
machines use 
shall try way 
wild thoughts big signal fire could sighted across mountain range 
sort improvised com unit said way 
smile dalgard face visible raf slowly clearing vision 
shall provide another kind machine waved mermen give us power hope 
lie gestured sand beside think friend ship natural surroundings 
try hold picture constant mind letting thought trouble 
mean send message mentally raf reply half protest 
reach city even knew individual scout reminded 
messages doubly possible sent friend friend 
close 
dalgard indicated mermen 
natural means communication 
pick reaching thought amplify power beam north 
since friend deals matters communication let us hope sensitive method 
raf half convinced might work remembered dalgard established contact scout pointed met 
voiceless cry aid pulled adventure first place 
fitting something process give help return 
obediently stretched sand closed dim eyes trying picture soriki small cabin held com slouched bucket seat deceptive posture lax idler seen many times 
soriki broad face flat cheekbones wide cheerful mouth heavy lidded eyes 
fixed soriki face tried believe confronting com tech speaking directly 
come come get south seashore soriki come get words formed kind chant chant aimed familiar face familiar surroundings 
south come get raf struggled think allow nothing break chant disturb picture scene called memory 
long attempt communication lasted pilot could tell somehow slipped deep concentration sleep dreamless untroubled awoke befogged feeling something important happened 
gotten ring mermen gone dawn gray chill forewarnings rain air 
reassured certain spite gloom sight fraction clearer day 
gotten arose brushing sand saw scout splashing sea fish impaled spear 
get raf blurted 
since friend reply mind touch know 
later shall try 
raf peering gaze dalgard face drawn gaunt look hard labor hours past 
walked beach slowly without springing step raf come associate 
settled gut fish one bone knives scout repeated try half hour later rain swept sea raf knew would try 
head went face eager 
known sound long well ever mistake drone flitter motor cutting swish falling water 
trick cliffs behind must magnifying projecting sound could sight machine 
coming 
whirled dalgard see feet taken spear 
flitter soriki heard coming raf hastened assure 
last time saw dalgard slow warm smile clearer ever seen 
scout turned trotted away toward fringing rock wall 
dropped sight behind barrier raised spear salute 
swift fortunate voyaging gave farewell homeport 
raf understood 
colonist meant said wanted contact space ship 
raf owed debt paid 
time yet men astra men terra meet 
hundred years perhaps thousand yet 
remembering summoned flitter winging toward raf drew deep breath 
would men astra accomplish hundred years could terra match knowledge challenge alone knew much challenge 
homeport must remain secret 
guided place saved mermen alone 
dalgard people must exist far crew rs concerned 
last time experienced intimacy mind touch 
brother sensation gone black blot flitter buzzed clouds 
behind rocks dalgard watched pilot enter strange machine 
single moment impulse shout run forward surrender desire see others ship brought space would confidently believed take back terra knew legend past 
mastered desire 
right 
road already forked going back 
must carry secret rest life must strong willed enough homeport would never know 
time give time could 
hundred years thousand yet nobody today telling better stories straight forward interstellar adventure
