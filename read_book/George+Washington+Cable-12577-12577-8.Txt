first came creole woman old know age grown girl days spanish governor general galvez sixty five years 
recognized plaintiff person known child john f miller domestic service mien eyes color white person german accent 
next came madame hemin known llers till met russian ship seen salome since parting amsterdam yet instantly identified came court room 
witness says continues record perceived family likeness plaintiff face came door 
next day came eva told story others followed whose testimony like anticipated 
plaintiff recognized salome girl mary mary bridget twenty years upward owned slavery first john f miller mother mrs canby length cabaret keeper louis belmonti 
two persons one twenty years least lived slave within five miles part time within two kindred freedom 
two persons one seemed scarcely possible doubt 
every one remembered salome shipboard recognize plaintiff others quite forgotten appearance recognized strong family likeness llers 
likeness even witnesses defense admit 
salome side testified madame koelhoffer madame schultzheimer young daniel miller ller mississippi 
easily pointed throng crowded court room 
already said another means identification seemed ought alone carried overwhelming conviction 
still hold reserve heard explanation offered john f miller court time daily press reply utterances giving voice public sympathy salome 
seems john fitz miller citizen new orleans high standing man property money enterprises slaves 
john lawson lewis commanding general state militia testified case mr miller generous social disposition easy circumstances kindness eighty slaves habit entertaining exceptional fineness equipage 
another witness testified complaints sometimes made miller neighbors great indulgence slaves 
others ladies well gentlemen corroborated good reports even kinder higher praises mother mrs canby 
stated alacrity intending slightest imputation gentleman character slaves even fairer skin mary bridget nevertheless young said looked like white girl 
one thing certainly made plain mr miller never taken ller family part attakapas knowingly bought redemptioner 
accounted possession plaintiff thus august one anthony williams pretending negro trader mobile somehow came contact mr john fitz miller new orleans 
represented sold stock slaves except one girl mary bridget ostensibly twelve years old must return mobile 
left girl mr miller sold williams account formal power attorney mr miller handing one hundred dollars advance prospective sale 
january williams yet heard girl sold st february mr miller sold mother lived words shall see 
sale price three hundred fifty dollars age still represented twelve 
time remained house mother wrote miller newspapers domestic servant sold belmonti 
mr miller public statement full candid looked 
girl sold mrs canby mother belmonti bought miller answer williams never appeared girl february girl bridget mother three children children bought back mr miller entirely passive mrs canby three hundred fifty dollars price four got seemed get mother alone child twelve years 
thus mr miller become owner woman two sons daughter service keeping never paid one hundred dollars 
point prudently overlooked public statement 
count necessary emphasize fact slave mother twenty eight years old little daughter died sold alone away two half grown sons ten times paid bond woman wifeless keeper dram shop 
omissions 
williams never come back either slave proceeds sale mr miller omitted state knew well enough girl evidently white williams could get rid even open sale 
months years passed without word williams presumption strong williams knew girl african tincture least within definition law content count provisional transfer miller equivalent sale 
miller heedless enough let us call hold african bondage twenty years woman witnesses testified every appearance white person without ever seen shadow title one everything indicate none 
whether better right several slaves whiter one witnesses forward state owned owned one seems inquired 
times really remarkable particular case involve lady noted good works gentleman drove finest equipage new orleans 
one point view current beliefs day compels attention 
one miller witnesses cross examined 
asked see slave woman among white ladies would think white replied say 
new orleans many white persons dark complexion many colored persons light complexion 
question followed features colored person designates say 
persons live countries many colored persons acquire instinctive means judging well explained
