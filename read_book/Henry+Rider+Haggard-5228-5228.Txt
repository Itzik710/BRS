still strict understanding mention made name connexion matter locality practice 
ten days ago called see mr holly old house upon cliff many years remained untenanted except caretakers house property family generations 
housekeeper summoned told master returned abroad somewhere asia said ill heart dying believed suppositions proved accurate 
found patient sitting bed ease heart strange looking old man 
dark eyes small full fire intelligence magnificent snowy white beard covered chest extraordinary breadth hair also white encroached upon forehead face much met whiskers upon cheeks 
arms remarkable length strength though one seemed much torn animal 
told dog done must dog unusual power 
ugly man yet forgive bull beautiful 
describe mean better saying face like face ordinary mortal met limited experience 
artist wished portray wise benevolent rather grotesque spirit take countenance model 
mr holly somewhat vexed called done without knowledge 
soon became friendly enough however expressed gratitude relief able give though could hope 
different times talked good deal various countries traveled apparently many years upon strange quest never clearly denned 
twice also became light headed spoke part languages identified greek arabic occasionally english also appeared addressing object veneration might almost say worship 
said however prefer repeat heard professional capacity 
one day pointed rough box made foreign wood duly despatched train giving name address said without fail forwarded death 
also asked manuscript like box sent 
saw looking last sheets burned away said repeat exact words yes yes helped must go 
see made mind destroy already fire command came clear unmistakable command snatched 
mr holly meant command know would speak matter 
pass last scene 
one night eleven clock knowing patient end near went see proposing inject strychnine keep heart going little longer 
reached house met caretaker coming seek great fright asked master dead 
answered gone got bed barefooted left house last seen grandson among scotch firs talking 
lad terrified wits thought beheld ghost told 
moonlight brilliant night especially fresh snow fallen reflected rays 
foot began search among firs till presently outside found track naked feet snow 
course followed calling housekeeper go wake husband one else lives near 
spoor proved easy trace across clean sheet snow 
ran slope hill behind house 
crest hill ancient monument upright monoliths set primeval people known locally devil ring sort miniature stonehenge fact 
seen several times happened present long ago meeting archaeological society origin purpose discussed 
remember one learned somewhat eccentric gentleman read short paper upon rude hooded bust head cut within chamber tall flat topped cromlech dolmen stands alone center ring 
said representation egyptian goddess isis place sacred form worship rate nature goddess like attributes suggestion learned gentlemen treated absurd 
declared isis never traveled britain though part see phoenicians even romans adopted cult less brought 
know nothing matters discuss 
remembered also mr holly acquainted place mentioned previous day asking stones still uninjured used young 
added also remark struck yonder would wish die 
answered feared would never take long walk noted smiled little 
well conversation gave clue without troubling footprints went fast could ring half mile away 
presently reached yes standing cromlech bareheaded clothed night things stood mr holly snow strangest figure think ever beheld 
indeed never shall forget wild scene 
circle rough single stones pointing upwards star strewn sky intensely lonely intensely solemn tall trilithon towering center shadow thrown bright moon behind lying long black upon dazzling sheet snow standing clear shadow could distinguish every motion even rapt look upon dying face white draped figure mr holly 
appeared uttering invocation arabic think long reached could catch tones full sonorous voice see waving outstretched arms 
right hand held looped sceptre express wish send drawings 
could see flash jewels strung upon wires great stillness hear tinkling golden bells 
presently seemed become aware another presence understand desire must ask identity suppressed 
naturally enough wish mixed superstitious tale face impossible absurd 
yet circumstances think right tell saw thought saw something gather shadow central dolmen emerge rude chamber know certain something bright glorious gradually took form woman upon whose forehead burned star like fire 
rate vision reflection whatever startled much came halt lee one monoliths found unable even call distraught man pursued 
whilst stood thus became clear mr holly also saw something 
least turned towards radiance shadow uttered one cry wild glad cry stepped forward seemed fall face 
reached spot light vanished found mr holly arms still outstretched sceptre gripped tightly hand lying quite dead shadow trilithon 
rest doctor letter need quoted deals certain improbable explanations origin figure light details removal holly body managed satisfy coroner inquest necessary 
box speaks arrived safely 
drawings need say nothing sistrum sceptre words 
fashioned crystal well known shape crux ansata emblem life egyptians rod cross loop combined one 
side side loop ran golden wires strung gems three colors glittering diamonds sea blue sapphires blood red rubies fourth wire top hung four little golden bells 
took hold first arm shook slightly excitement bells began sound sweet faint music like chimes heard far away night silence sea 
thought perhaps fancy thrill passed hallowed beautiful thing body 
mystery recorded manuscript make comment 
inner significations every reader must form judgment 
one thing alone clear hypothesis mr holly tells truth leo vincey saw experienced least believe though sundry interpretations mystery advanced ayesha others none quite satisfactory 
indeed like mr holly incline theory may still call name although seldom given pages put forward vague isis myth wondrous picture story mountain fire mere veils hide truth purpose reveal last song never sang

tall although seemed spare eye girth matched height many years desert life turned muscles steel 
hair grown long like protection sun cold hung upon neck curling golden mane great beard hung upon breast spreading outwards almost massive shoulders 
face could seen beautiful though burnt brown weather refined full thought sombre almost clear crystal steady stars shone large gray eyes 
always ugly hirsute iron gray also spite sixty odd years still wonderfully strong strength seemed increase time health perfect 
fact period rough travels although met accidents laid us awhile neither us known day sickness 
hardship seemed turned constitutions iron made impervious every human ailment 
alone amongst living men inhaled breath essence life fears relieved notwithstanding foodless night yet neither us showed signs exhaustion turned contemplate landscape 
feet beyond little belt fertile soil began great desert sort familiar sandy salt encrusted treeless waterless streaked first snows winter 
beyond eighty hundred miles away lucent atmosphere impossible say far exactly rose mountains veritable sea white peaks soared upwards scores 
golden rays rising sun touched snows splendor saw leo eyes become troubled 
swiftly turned looked along edge desert 
see said pointing something dim enormous 
presently light reached also 
mighty mountain ten miles away stood among sands 
turned back desert stared slope hills along base traveling 
yet gloom sun behind presently light began flow crests like flood 
crept lower yet lower till reached little plateau three hundred yards us 
edge plateau looking solemnly across waste sat great ruined idol colossal buddha rear idol built yellow stone appeared low crescent shaped mass monastery

heart also stomach starving sank thought gazed doubtfully little coil blue smoke sprang chimney never think see joyful sight 
center edifice large building evidently temple nearer us saw small door almost smoke appeared 
door went knocked calling aloud open open holy lamas

asked leave retire chamber order rest upon good imitations beds slept solidly four twenty hours rising last perfectly refreshed well 
introduction monastery mountains name destined spend next six months lives 
within days long giving us complete confidence good hearted simple old monks told us history 
seemed old time lamasery dwelt several hundred brethren

escaped bring sad news communities five generations attempt made occupy place 
length revealed friend kou en young man incarnation one old monks monastery also named kou en duty present life return thither would win much merit receive many wonderful revelations

indeed certain could stopped long enough say ten years might persuaded accept new revelation prophets 
spare hours told many tales monastery called world really delightful sense piteous see joy listened stories wondrous countries new races men knew russia china semi savage tribes inhabitants mountains deserts 
right us learn declared knows perhaps future incarnations may become inhabitants places 
though time passed thus comfort indeed compared many experiences luxury oh hearts hungry burned consuming fire quest 
felt threshold yes knew knew yet wretched physical limitations made impossible us advance single step 
desert beneath fell snow moreover great winds arose suddenly drove snows like dust piling heaps high trees beneath unfortunate traveller would buried 
must wait nothing else done 
one alleviation found one 
ruined room monastery library many volumes placed doubtless monks massacred times bygone 
less cared arranged successors gave us liberty examine often pleased 
truly strange collection imagine priceless value among found buddhistic sivaistic shamanistic writings never seen heard together lives multitude bodhisatvas distinguished saints written various tongues understand 
proved interesting us however diary many tomes generations kept khubilghans abbots old lamasery every event importance recorded great detail 
turning pages one last volumes diary written apparently two hundred fifty years earlier shortly destruction monastery came upon entry following quote memory substance summer year great sandstorm brother name given forget found desert man people dwell beyond far mountains rumors reached lamasery time time 
living beside bodies two companions overwhelmed sand thirst 
fierce looking 
refused say came desert telling us followed road known ancients communication people outer world ceased 
gathered however brethren fled committed crime condemned die accompanied flight 
told us fine country beyond mountains fertile plagued droughts earthquakes latter indeed often feel 
people country said warlike numerous followed agriculture 
always lived though ruled khans descendants greek king called alexander conquered much country south west us 
may true records tell us two thousand years ago army sent invader penetrated parts though nothing said 
stranger man told us also people worship priestess called hes hesea said reign generation generation 
lives great mountain apart feared adored queen country government seldom interferes 
however sacrifices offered incurs vengeance dies even chiefs land afraid

made man angry 
indeed declared buddha strong priestess would show avenged upon us 
gave food turned lamasery went saying returned learn spoke truth

precis strange entry discovery vague thrilled us hope excitement 
nothing appeared man country within little year date diary abbot came sudden end without indication unusual events occured expected 
indeed last item written parchment book mentioned preparation certain new lands used sowing grain future seasons suggested brethren neither feared expected disturbance 
wondered whether man beyond mountains good word brought vengeance priestess called hesea upon community sheltered 
also wondered ah wondered hesea might 
day following discovery prayed abbot kou en accompany us library read passage asked knew anything matter 
swayed wise old head always reminded tortoise answered little 
little mostly army greek king mentioned writing

leo began great laugh managed kick beneath table turned sneeze 
fortunate ribald merriment would hurt old man feelings terribly 
also leo said surely people mock theory incarnation way first article faith among nearly one quarter human race foolish quarter 
ask instruction learned one seeing memory perishes death ah answered brother holly may seem oftentimes comes back especially far advanced upon path

ridiculous sight truly see holy khublighan well wrong side eighty weeping like child dream beautiful woman imagined dreamt last life two thousand years ago 
reader say 
holly reasons felt deep sympathy poor old man leo also sympathetic 
patted back assured victim evil hallucination could never brought future existence since sin must forgiven long ago forth 
calm somewhat restored tried also extract information poor results far priestess concerned 
said know religion belonged care thought must evil one 
went away next morning army never saw heard though came mind obliged locked cell eight days prevent following 
yes heard one thing abbot day told brethren 
priestess real general army king queen latter hated 
pushed northwards across desert country beyond mountains desired establish worship 
asked really country beyond mountains kou en answered wearily believed 
either previous life heard people lived worshipped fire 
certainly also true thirty years ago brother climbed great peak yonder spend days solitary meditation returned reported seen marvellous thing namely shaft fire burning heavens beyond mountains though whether vision could say 
recalled however time felt great earthquake 
memory fancied transgression began afflict kou en innocent old heart crept away lamenting seen week

old monk rested well enough neither leo slept much wonder might see top mountain banished sleep 
next morning dawn weather still favourable companion returned monastery whither said would follow day two 
last alone without wasting instant began ascent peak 
many thousand feet high certain places steep enough deep frozen snow made climbing easy midday reached top

remembered mysterious light fell upon us peak compass able roughly take bearings 
lack better guide followed bearings traveling almost due north east direction shone fire 
day beautiful weather marched across flower strewn desert seeing nothing except bunches game one two herds wild asses come mountains feed upon new grass 
evening approached shot antelope made camp brought yak tent us among tamarisk scrub dry stems furnished us fuel 
lack water since scraping sand soaked melted snow found plenty fair quality 
night supped luxury upon tea antelope meat indeed glad spared little store dried provisions 
next morning ascertained position well could estimated crossed quarter desert guess proved accurate evening fourth day journey reached bottom slopes opposing mountains without experienced either accident fatigue 
leo said things going like clockwork reminded good start often meant bad finish 
wrong came hardships 
begin mountains proved exceeding high took us two days climb lower slopes 
also heat sun softened snow made walking laborious whilst accustomed though conditions long years traveling continual glitter affected eyes 
morning seventh day found us mouth defile wound away heart mountains 
seemed possible path followed much cheered discover must run road 
could see road indeed everything buried snow 
one lay beneath feet certain since although marched along edge precipices path however steep always flat moreover rock upon one side often scarped hand man 
could doubt snow cling saw tool marks upon bare surface 
also came several places galleries built mountain side means beams let still common practice thibet 
beams course long since rotted away leaving gulf us continuation path 
met gaps forced go back make detour round mountain although much delayed thereby happened always managed regain road without difficulty danger 
tried us skill experience mountaineers could help us cold night obliged camp severe frost great altitude endure long hours darkness penetrating icy winds soughed ceaselessly pass 
length tenth day reached end defile night falling camped bitter cold 
miserable hours fuel boil water must satisfy thirst eating frozen snow eyes smarted sorely could sleep notwithstanding wraps warmth gathered yak little tent cold caused teeth chatter like castanets 
dawn came sunrise 
crept tent leaving standing awhile dragged stiffened limbs hundred yards spot defile took turn order might thaw rays sun hour could reach us camped 
leo round first heard utter exclamation 
seconds reached side lo us lay promised land 
far beneath us ten thousand feet least must remembered viewed top mountain stretched away away till distances met horizon 
character quite flat alluvial plain probably primeval age bottom one vast lakes number exist central asia process desiccation 
one object relieved dreary flatness single snow clad gigantic mountain even distance far us could clearly see outline 
indeed could see rounded crest rose great plume smoke showing active volcano hither lip crater enormous pillar rock whereof top formed shape loop 
yes stood us symbol vision sought many years sight hearts beat fast breath came quickly 
noted although seen passage mountains since peaks ahead rocky sides defile hid view great height overtopped tallest 
made clear us came possible ray light passing loop could fall upon highest snows towering pinnacle climbed upon side desert 
also certain cause ray smoke behind loop explained mystery 
doubtless times volcano awake smoke must replaced flame emitting light fearful intensity light reached us concentrated directed loop 
rest thought thirty miles away could make white roofed town set upon mound situated among trees upon banks wide river flowed across plain 
also evident country large population cultivated soil aid pair field glasses one remaining cherished possessions could see green springing crops pierced irrigation canals lines trees marked limits fields 
yes us stretched promised land rose mystic mount march snow slopes enter would 
thus thought folly little guessing lay us terrors weary suffering must endure stood length beneath shadow symbol life 
fatigues forgotten returned tent hastily swallowed dried food washed lumps snow gave us toothache chilled us inside thirst compelled us eat dragged poor yak feet loaded started 
great haste occupied us thoughts memory serves scarcely interchanged word 
snow slopes marched swiftly without hesitation road marked us means pillars rock set opposite one another intervals 
pillars observed satisfaction told us still upon highway led promised land 
yet could help noting one seemed gone use since exception wild sheep tracks spoor bears mountain foxes single sign beast man could discover 
however explained reflected fact doubtless road used summer season 
perhaps inhabitants country stay home people never traveled 
slopes longer thought indeed darkness closed reached foot 
obliged spend another night snow pitching tent shelter hanging rock 
descended many thousand feet temperature proved fortunately little milder indeed think eighteen twenty degrees frost night 
also heat sun melted snow secluded places able find water drink yak could fill poor old stomach dead looking mountain mosses seemed think better nothing 
still dawn came throwing red garment lonesome endless mountains dragged numbed feet ate remaining food started onwards 
could longer see country beneath even towering volcano hidden us intervening ridge seemed pierced single narrow gulley towards headed 
indeed pillars showed us thither ran buried road 
mid day appeared quite close us tramped feverish haste 
chanced however need hurry hour later learned truth 
us mouth gulley rose rather sank sheer precipice apparently three four hundred feet depth foot could hear sound water 
right edge precipice ran path one stone pillars stood upon extreme brink yet could road descend place stared aghast possible solution occurred us 
see said leo hollow laugh gulf opened since track used volcanic action probably 
perhaps perhaps wooden bridge stairway rotted 
matter 
must find another path answered cheerfully could 
yes soon said wish stop ever 
turned right marched along edge precipice till mile away came small glacier surface sprinkled large stones frozen substance 
glacier hung face cliff like petrified waterfall whether reached foot could discover

point onwards could see precipice increased depth far eye could reach absolutely sheer 
went back searched left road 
mountains receded us rose mighty dazzling slope snow us lay pitiless unclimbable gulf

length struggled top hundred fifty feet high discover also beyond glacier gulf infinitely deeper spot road ended deep indeed could see bottom although came sound roaring water 
moreover quite half mile width 
whilst stared round us sinking sun vanished behind mountain sky heavy light went like candle 
ascent hillock proved steep especially one place obliged climb sort rock ladder scarcely cared attempt struggle gloom 
therefore remembering little choose top knoll snow plain foot matter temperature conveniences quite exhausted determined spend night upon thereby learn saving lives 
unloading yak pitched tent lee topmost knob rock ate couple handfuls dried fish corn cake 
last food brought us lamasery reflected dismay unless could shoot something commissariat represented carcass old friend yak 
wrapped thick rugs fur garments forgot miseries sleep 
long daylight awakened sudden terrific sound like boom great cannon followed thousands sounds might compared fusillade musketry 
great heaven said 
crawled tent yet could see nothing whilst yak began low terrified manner 
could see could hear feel 
booming cracking ceased followed soft grinding noise sickening sound think ever listened 
accompanied strange steady unnatural wind seemed press upon us water presses 
dawn broke saw 
mountain side moving upon us vast avalanche snow 
oh sight 
crest precipitous slopes two miles away came living thing rolling sliding gliding piling long leaping waves hollowing cavernous valleys like tempest driven sea whilst surface hung powdery cloud frozen spray 
watched clinging terrified first waves struck hill causing mighty mass solid rock quiver like yacht beneath impact ocean roller aspen sudden rush wind 
struck slowly separated majestic motion flowed like water edge precipice either side fell thudding sound unmeasured depths beneath 
little thing mere forerunner slow serpentine movement rolled body avalanche

indeed bombardment devised directed man could half terrible anything destroy half destructive 
scene appalling unchained resistless might evolved suddenly completest calm 
lap quiet mountains looked upon peaceful tender sky powers hidden breast nature suddenly set free companioned whirlwinds terrifying majesty sound loosed upon heads us two human atoms 
first rush snow leapt back behind protecting peak lying full length upon ground gripped clung fearing lest wind whirl us abyss 
long ago tent gone like dead leaf autumn gale times seemed must follow 
boulders hurtled past us one fell full upon little peak shattering crest bursting fragments fled away singing wild song 
touched looked behind us see yak risen terror lying dead headless 
fear lay still waiting end wondering dimly whether buried surging snow swept away hill crushed flying rocks lifted lost hurricane 
long last never knew 
may ten minutes two hours scene time loses proportion 
became aware wind fallen noise grinding snow hurtling boulders ceased 
cautiously gained feet looked 
front us sheer mountain side depth two miles width thousand yards covered many feet snow bare rock 
piled face hill almost summit lay tongue snow pressed consistency ice spotted boulders lodged 
peak torn shattered revealed great gleaming surfaces pits glittered mica mineral 
vast gulf behind half filled avalanche debris 
rest seemed though nothing happened sun shone sweetly overhead solemn snows reflected rays sides hundred hills

position dared attempt descend mount lest sink loose snow buried 
moreover along breadth path avalanche boulders time time still thundered rocky slope came patches snow left behind big slide small true large enough kill hundred men 
obvious therefore conditions changed death released us must abide upon crest hillock 
sat foodless frightened wondering old friend kou en would say could see us

let skin said leo something shall want hide night 
affection even reverence performed office dead companion journeyings rejoicing brought end 
indeed long residence among peoples believed fully souls men could pass risen bodies animals made us little superstitious matter

mile road ran winding rocky gorge till suddenly took turn country kaloon lay stretched us 
feet river probably made acquaintance gulf fed mountain snows source 
flowed rapidly vast alluvial lands beneath became broad gentle stream wound way limitless plains till lost blue distance 
north however smooth monotonous expanse broken mountain guided us afar house fire 
great distance us hundred miles say yet even majestic sight clear air 
many leagues base peak ground began rise brown rugged hillocks sprang holy mountain white dazzling point soared full twenty thousand feet heavens

ponies taken palanquins packed away ropes green hide fastened iron rings prows boats fixed towing tackle animals reharnessed

placing gravely seat front us explained nightfall coming wished give us company protection dark 
see give slip muttered leo 
drivers whipped ponies went 
look behind said simbri presently see city sleep night 
turned ten miles away perceived flat roofed town considerable though great size 
position good set upon large island stood hundred feet level plain river dividing two branches foot discovered afterwards uniting beyond 
vast mound upon city built appearance artificial possibly soil whereof formed washed past ages times flood mudbank center broad river grew degrees present proportions 
exception columned towered edifice crowned city seemed encircled gardens could see great buildings place 
city named asked leo simbri 
kaloon answered land even fore fathers conquerors marched across mountains took two thousand years ago 
kept ancient title territory mountain called hes said loop upon yonder peak symbol goddess name general worshipped 
priestesses still live said leo trying turn extract truth 
yes priests also 
college established conquerors subdued land 
rather took place another college fashioned sanctuary temple whose god fire mountain people kaloon day 
worshipped goddess hes said know little matter us mountain folk enmity ages 
kill us kill jealous shrine none may visit save permission consult oracle make prayer offering times calamity khan dies waters river sink crops fail ashes fall earthquakes shake land great sickness comes 
otherwise unless attack us leave alone though every man trained arms fight need peaceful folk cultivate soil generation generation thus grow rich 
look round 
scene peace stood boat gazed us pastoral prospect 
everywhere appeared herds cattle feeding upon meadow lands troops mules horses square fields sown corn outlined trees 
village folk also clad long gray gowns laboring land day toil finished driving beasts homewards along roads built upon banks irrigation dykes towards hamlets placed rising knolls amidst tall poplar groves 
sharp contrast arid deserts fearful mountains amongst wandered many years country struck us charming indeed seen red light sinking sun spring day even beautiful kind beauty found holland 
one could understand landowners peasant farmers would choice men peace temptation wealth must offer hungry half savage tribes mountains 
also easy guess survivors alexander legions egyptian general burst iron band snow clad hills saw sweet country homes herds ripening grass must cried one voice march fight toil 
sit us live die 
thus doubtless taking wives among women people land conquered perhaps single battle 
light faded wreaths smoke hung distant fire mountain began glow luridly 
redder angry become darkness gathered till length seemed charged pulsing sheets flame propelled womb volcano threw piercing beams light eye giant loop crowned brow 
far far fled beams making bright path across land striking white crests bordering wall mountains 
high air ran path dim roofs city kaloon river yes straight us mountains doubtless though could follow across desert high eminence farther side lain bathed radiance 
wondrous impressive sight one filled companions fear steersmen boats drivers towing path groaned aloud began utter prayers 
say asked leo simbri 
say lord spirit mountain angry passes yonder flying light called road hes work evil land 
therefore pray destroy 
light always shine thus asked 
nay seldom 
three months ago night years 
let us pray portends misfortune kaloon inhabitants 
minutes fearsome illumination continued ceased suddenly begun remained dull glow crest peak 
presently moon rose white shining ball rays perceived drew near city 
still something left us see reached shelter 
sat quietly boat silence broken lapping still waters sides occasional splash slackened tow line upon surface heard distant sound hunt full cry 
nearer nearer came volume swelling every moment till quite close last 
echoing trodden earth towing path ponies traveled west bank river heard beat hoofs horse galloping furiously 
presently appeared fine white animal back sat man 
passed us like flash went man lifted turned head saw face moonlight saw also agony fear written eyes 
come darkness 
gone darkness swelled awful music 
look dog appeared huge red dog dropped foaming muzzle ground galloped lifted uttered deep throated bell like bay 
others followed yet others must hundred every one baying took scent 
death hounds muttered clasping leo arm 
yes answered running poor devil 
comes huntsman 
spoke appeared second figure splendidly mounted cloak streaming shoulders hand long whip waved 
big loosely jointed passed turned face also saw madman 
could doubt insanity blazed hollow eyes rang savage screeching laugh 
khan khan said simbri bowing could see afraid

yes heading straight us time across country 
white horse rider appeared utterly exhausted poor beast could scarcely struggle towing path 
gained great red hound black ear gripped flank touch fangs screamed aloud terror horse 
rider sprang back horror ran river edge thinking evidently take refuge boat

truly agreeable prospect us yet could help reflecting object lesson horrid scene advantages 
reached place river forked end island disembarked upon quay 
guard men commanded household officer waiting receive us 
led us gate high wall town fortified narrow stone paved street ran houses apparently usual central asian type far could judge moonlight pretensions architectural beauty large size 
clearly arrival expected excited interest people gathered knots street watch us pass also windows houses even flat roofs 
top long street sort market place crossing accompanied curious crowd made remarks us could understand reached gate inner wall 
challenged word simbri opened passed find gardens 
following road drive came large rambling house palace surmounted high towers solidly built stone heavy bastard egyptian style 
beyond doorway found courtyard surrounded kind verandah short passages led different rooms 
one passages conducted officer apartment rather suite consisting sitting two bed chambers panelled richly furnished rather barbaric fashion well lighted primitive oil lamps 
simbri left us saying officer would wait outer room conduct us dining hall soon ready 
entered bed chambers found servants slaves quiet mannered obsequious men 
valets changed foot gear taking heavy traveling robes replaced others fashioned like civilized frock coats made white material trimmed beautiful ermine fur 
dressed us bowed show toilette finished led us large outer room officer awaited us 
conducted us several rooms spacious apparently unoccupied great hall lit many lamps warmed nights still cold large peat fires 
roof hall flat supported thick stone columns carved capitals walls hung worked tapestries gave air considerable comfort 
head hall dais stood long narrow table spread cloth set platters cups silver 
waited till butlers wands appeared curtains drew 
came man beating silver gong dozen courtiers dressed white robes like followed perhaps many ladies young good looking part fair type well cut features though others rather yellow skinned 
bowed us 
pause studied one another till trumpet blew heralded footmen kind yellow livery two figures seen advancing passage beyond curtains preceded shaman simbri followed officers 
khan khania kaloon 
one looking khan entered dining hall clad festal white attire would imagined raving human brute seen urging devilish hounds tear fellow creature helpless horse fragments devour 
seemed heavy loutish man strongly built ill looking shifty eyes evidently person dulled intellect one would thought incapable keen emotions kind 
khania need described 
chambers gate weary looking indeed eyes haunted air easy see events previous night left mark upon mind 
sight us flushed little beckoned us advance said husband lord strangers told 
dull eyes fell upon first appearance seemed amuse vaguely rate laughed rudely saying barbarous greek mixed words local patois curious old animal never seen great khan answered seen hunting night 
good sport instantly became wide awake answered rubbing hands excellent 
gave us fine run little dogs caught last snapped powerful jaws together 
cease brutal talk broke wife fiercely slunk away stumbled leo waiting presented

consequently although precious metals mined certain extent manufactured articles use ornament money exist among peoples either plain mountain business transacted principle barter even revenue collected kind 
amongst tens thousands aborigines kaloon dwelt mere handful ruling class said probably descended conquerors appeared time alexander 
blood however much mixed first inhabitants judge appearance yellow hue descendants must belonged branch great tartar race 
government could called whole mild though despotic nature vested hereditary khan khania according man woman might direct descent 
religions two people worshipped spirit fire mountain rulers believed magic ghosts divinations 
even shadow religion called dying like followers generation generation white lords grew less number became absorbed bulk people 
still rule tolerated

moreover present khania hostess last direct line rulers husband cousin less blood royal veins people attached 
also commonly case bold beautiful women popular among especially liberal poor 
many country populated accounted wonderful state cultivation 
lastly trusted skill courage defend continual attacks mountain tribes raided crops herds

set record full would tedious useless tell briefly principal adventures 
morrow arrival khania atene sent us two beautiful white horses pure ancient blood noon mounted went ride accompanied guard soldiers 
first led us kennels death hounds kept great flagged courts surrounded iron bars narrow locked gates 
never seen brutes large fierce mastiffs thibet lap dogs compared 
red black smooth coated blood hound head moment saw us came ravening leaping bars angry wave leaps rock 
hounds charge men certain families tended generations 
obeyed keepers khan readily enough stranger might venture near 
also brutes executioners land murderers criminals thrown seen khan hunted incurred displeasure 
moreover used innocent purpose chasing certain great bucks preserved woods swamps reeds 
thus came terror country since man knew end might devoured 
going dogs term full meaning land kaloon significance terrible 
looked hounds without prophetic shudder rode round walls town laid kind boulevard inhabitants walked took pleasure evenings 
however much see except river beneath plain beyond moreover though thick high places must passed carefully like everything else effete ruling class allowed fall disrepair 
town uninteresting place also part peopled hangers court 
sorry crossed river high pitched bridge days come destined behold one strangest sights ever seen mortal man rode country 
different found among husbandmen descendants original owners land lived upon produce 
every available inch soil seemed cultivated aid wonderful system irrigation 
indeed water lifted levels would flow naturally means wheels turned mules even places carried women bore poles shoulders balanced buckets 
leo asked khania happened bad season 
replied grimly famine happened thousands people perished famine came pestilence 
famines periodical added people would long ago driven kill like hungry rats since outlet increasing rapidly land large could hold 
good year asked 
feared answered river risen well rains fallen 
also light shone last night fire mountain thought bad omen means say spirit mountain angry drought follow 
let us hope say also strangers visited land bringing bad luck 
said leo laugh shall fly mountain take refuge 
wish take refuge death asked darkly 
sure guests never live shall allowed cross river borders slopes yonder peak 
khania lord leo name rule law 
come let us turn homewards 
night eat great hall room adjoined bed chambers 
left alone however khania uncle shaman always attended joined meal 
greeted wondering said briefly arranged thus refused expose us insults 
added festival begun would last week wish us see vile ways people 
evening many others followed never dined central hall passed pleasantly enough khania made leo tell england born lands visited peoples customs 
spoke also history alexander whose general rassen far forefather conquered country kaloon land egypt whence latter came went till midnight atene listened us greedily eyes fixed always leo face 
many nights spend thus palace city kaloon fact close prisoners 
oh days hung heavy hands 
went courtyard reception rooms palace lords followers gathered round us pestered us questions idle also curious 
also women fair enough began talk us pretext best make love leo contrast slim delicate looking men found deep chested yellow haired stranger taste 
indeed troubled much gifts flowers messages sent servants soldiers making assignations course keep 
went streets matters bad people ceased business followed us staring us till took refuge palace gardens 
remained therefore rides country khania three four came end owing jealousy khan vowed went together would follow death hounds 
must ride alone center large guard soldiers sent see attempt escape accompanied often mob peasants threats entreaties demanded give back rain said taken 
great drought begun earnest 
thus came length resource making pretence fish river water clear low could catch nothing watching fire mountain loomed distance mysterious unreachable vainly racking brains plans escape thither least communicate priestess could learn 
two great burdens lay upon souls 
burden desire continue search meet reward sure pluck amid snows yonder peak could come burden approaching catastrophe hands khania atene 
made love leo since night gateway indeed even wished would difficult since took care never left one hour alone 
duenna could clung spanish princess closely leo 
yet could see well passion whit abated grew day day indeed fire swells heart volcano soon must break loose spread ruin round 
omen read words gestures tragic eyes 
chapter x shaman chamber one night simbri asked us dine apartments highest tower palace known us fateful place indeed last act mighty drama destined fulfilled 
went glad enough change 
eaten leo grew thoughtful said suddenly friend simbri wish ask favor beg khania let us go ways 
instantly shaman cunning old face became like mask ivory 
surely better ask favors lady lord think reason refused replied 
let us stop fencing said leo consider facts 
seemed khania atene happy husband 
eyes keen lord shall say deceived seemed went leo reddening good look undeserved regard 
ah perhaps guessed gate house yonder forgotten men would remember 
remember certain things simbri 
shaman stroked beard said proceed little add simbri except minded bring scandal name first lady land 
nobly said lord nobly said though trouble much things 
matter could managed without scandal instance khania chose take another husband whole land would rejoice last royal race 
take another husband one living true indeed question considered answer men die 
common lot khan drinking heavily late 
mean men murdered said leo angrily 
well nothing crime 
understand words passed lips heard rustle turned head 
behind us curtains beyond shaman slept kept instruments divination worked horoscopes 
drawn royal array stood khania still statue 
spoke crime asked cold voice

passed long years felt drawing near slowly slowly ever drawing nearer wending onward outward peoples world across hills across plains across sands across snows side 
length came end one night three moons ago whilst wise man uncle sat together studying lore taught striving wring secrets past vision came 
look lost charmed sleep looses spirit body gives strength stray afar see things yet 
saw companion clinging point broken ice river gulf 
lie written upon scroll 
yes man dreams knew place hurried thither waited water thinking perhaps beneath lay dead 
waited lo two tiny figures appeared far upon icy tongue man may climb oh know rest 
spellbound stood saw slip hang saw sever thin cord rush downwards yes saw brave man holly leap headlong 
mine hand drew torrent otherwise must drowned love long past day aye time 
yes leo vincey 
spirit foresaw danger hand delivered death would refuse khania kaloon proffer spoke leaned upon table looking face lips trembled appealing eyes 
lady said leo saved thank though perhaps would better let drown

oh blame moaned policy bound madman ever loathed 
urged yes even simbri uncle deed accursed head urged saying necessary end war rassen faction 
last true race moreover must carried saying also dreams rememberings sick phantasies 
alas alas yielded thinking make people great

well blame khania although tell must cut knot tied taking life husband choice forsooth decreed fate fate shaped 
yes must kill

atene listened stood silent perhaps answer 
said little laugh well think yonder none would wish wed 
fire spare lovely shameless spirit haunts drive men mad evil longings though secret thought spasm pain crossed face caught breath 
went cold voice wanderers land secrets foreigner must pry 
say yet live set foot upon mountain

make prayer fitting learned much 
therefore consider well night next sundown answer 
offered go back tomorrow shall tell whether take time comes come must rule land great happy love whether familiar together die 
choose vengeance atene love since minded mocked land wanton sought stranger refused 
slowly slowly intense whisper spoke words fell one one lips like drops blood death wound followed silence 
never shall forget scene 
old wizard watched us horny eyes blinked like night bird 
stood imperial woman royal robes icy rage written face vengeance glance 
facing great form leo quiet alert determined holding back doubts fears iron hand 
right noting things wondering long familiar earned atene hate would left alive upon earth 
thus stood watching till suddenly noted flame lamp us flickered felt draught strike upon face 
looked round became aware another presence 
yonder shadow showed tall form man 
see shambled forward silently saw feet naked 
reached ring lamplight burst savage laugh 
khan 
atene wife looked saw never admire passionate woman boldness admired little else save beauty face showed neither anger fear contempt 
yet cause afraid well knew 
rassen asked creeping naked feet get back drink ladies court 
still laughed hyena laugh 
heard said makes merry heard rassen gurgled screams hideous glee 
oho heard khania last true blood first land proud princess let robes soiled ladies court wife wife asked marry mark strangers cousin rival ruler richest lord land thereby thought would increase power heard offer nameless wanderer great yellow beard heard hates would escape screamed laughter refuse fashion would refuse lowest woman palace 
heard also always knew mad strangers made mad hate philtre old rat pointed simbri gave drink yes marriage feast 
worked well truly one hate khania atene 
bear touch makes sick 
loathe room taints air smell sorceries 
seems takes thus also yellow beard well ask old rat love drink mix think sweet sound fair spend months jollily enough 
man fool cup thrust hands looks goodly 
drink drink deep 
never guess liquor bad till morrow though mixed husband poisoned blood rassen screamed unholy mirth 
bitter insults venomed sting truth atene listened without word 
turned us bowed 
guests said pray pardon help 
strayed corrupt evil land stands crown flower 
khan rassen doom written hasten little near though naught many year save snake haunts house 
otherwise next cup drank still madness vile tongue gives venom voice 
uncle come 
hand grow weak shame woe 
old shaman hobbled forward came face face khan stopped looked dim eyes 
said rassen saw born son evil woman father none knew flame flared night upon fire mountain stars hid faces none would even evil influence 
saw wed rise drunken marriage feast arm wanton neck 
seen rule wasting land cruel pleasure turning fertile fields great parks game leaving tilled starve upon road drown ditches misery 
soon soon shall see die pain blood chain fall neck noble lady revile another worthy shall take place rear children fill throne land shall rest 
listened words none hear guess fearful bitterness spoken expecting every moment khan would draw short sword side cut old man 
cowered like dog savage master weight whose whip knows 
yes answering nothing shrank corner cowered simbri taking atene hand went room 
massive iron bound door turned pointing crouching figure staff said khan rassen raised cast 
remember lie dying blood pain 
footsteps died away khan crept corner looking furtively 
rat gone asked us wiping damp brow sleeve saw fear sobered awhile madness left eyes 
answered gone 
think coward went passionately true afraid yellow beard afraid turn comes 
tell sapped strength crazed drugged drink making thing war wizardries look 
prince lord half land noble form upright heart loved accursed beauty must love turns eyes 
turned sought marriage old rat bore message 
stayed great war married khania became khan better crept kitchen scullion chamber husband 
first hated loved hated till wedding feast doctored poison made loathe thus divorced us made mad also eating brain like fire 
hated sorely khan asked mix stronger draught done policy ruled half land 
suited also live thing mock since alive husband could forced upon people 
woman witch desires live alone thought night glowered leo 
knew also although must shrink still love heart still jealous therefore protect men 
set lord dogs tore awhile ago powerful sought favor would denied 
glowered leo know always seemed cold 
lived man melt whose ice husbanded fire 
leo stood silent stepped forward 
listen khan said 
ice seem like melting little ago unless lied 
fire yet hot enough 
wait awhile burns melt must match atene ice desires flee fire khan said kill seek blood 
think would rob wife yet thought towards 
desire escape town gates locked prisoners guarded night day 
hear 
power set us free rid us 
khan looked cunningly 
set free whither would go could tumble yonder gorge birds climb heights 
fire mountain business 
rassen stared 
mad wish visit fire mountain yet nothing save believe 
might return bring others 
perchance lady wish land also right conquest 
foes yonder 
answered leo earnestly 
one man another tell 
ask smile wife acre soil 
wise help us gone live undisturbed fashion may please 
khan stood still awhile swinging long arms vacantly till something seemed come mind moved merriment burst one hideous laughs 
thinking said atene would say woke find sweet bird flown 
would search angry 
seems angrier answered 
give us night start let search never closely shall find us 
forget wanderer old rat arts 
knew meet might know seek 
yet yet would rare see rage 
oh yellow beard yellow beard went mimicking wife voice 
come back let melt ice yellow beard 
laughed said suddenly ready half hour answered 
good 
go chambers prepare 
join presently 
went 
chapter xi hunt kill reached rooms meeting one passages made preparations 
first changed festal robes warmer garments traveled city kaloon 
ate drank could victuals stood antechamber knowing find food filled two satchels people sling shoulders remains meat liquor necessaries 
also strapped big hunting knives middles armed short spears made stabbing game 
perhaps laid plot murder us may well defend suggested leo 
nodded echoes khan last laugh still rang ears 
evil laugh 
likely enough said 
trust insane brute 
still wishes rid us 
yes said live men may return whereas dead 
atene thinks otherwise commented 
yet threatened us death answered leo 
shame passion make mad replied silent 
presently door opened came khan muffled great cloak though disguise 
come said ready 
catching sight spears held added need things 
go hunting 
answered say might hunted 
believe perhaps best stay till khania wearies yellow beard opens gates replied eyeing cunning glance 
think said started khan leading way motioning us silent 
passed empty rooms verandah verandah courtyard whispered us keep shadow 
moon shone clearly night clearly remember could see grass grew joints pavement little shadows thrown separate blade upon worn surface stones 
wondered pass gate guard stationed late doubled order khania 
gate left upon right taking path led great walled garden rassen brought us door hidden behind clump shrubs unlocked key carried 
outside palace wall road ran past kennels 
went great sleepless death hounds wandered fro like prowling lions caught wind burst sudden chorus terrific bays 
shivered sound fearful silence also thought would arouse keepers 
khan went bars showed whereon brutes knew ceased noise 
fear said returned huntsmen know starved night morrow certain criminals thrown 
reached palace gates 
khan bade us hide archway departed 
looked thought minds gone fetch murderers make end us 
wrong presently heard sound horses hoofs upon stones returned leading two white steeds atene given us 
saddled hands whispered 
speed parting guest mount hide faces cloaks follow 
mounted trotted us like running footman great lords kaloon employed went business pleasure 
leaving main street led us quarter town evil reputation tortuous ways 
met revellers time time night birds flitted doorways throwing aside veils looked us made sign drew back thinking passed assignation 
reached deserted docks upon river edge came little quay alongside broad ferryboat fastened 
must put horses row across rassen said bridges guarded without discovering bid soldiers let pass 
little trouble urged horses boat held bridles leo took oars 
go ways accursed wanderers cried khan thrust us quay pray spirit mountain old rat pupil love yellow beard love watching magic glass 
may meet 
stream caught us sweeping boat towards center river began laugh horrible laugh calling us ride fast ride fast safety strangers death behind 
leo put strength backed water punt hung upon edge stream 
think well land kill man means mischief said 
spoke english rassen must caught ring voice guessed meaning cunning mad 
least shouted late fools last laugh turned ran swiftly quay cloak flew upon air behind vanished shadows head 
row said leo bent oars 
ferry boat cumbersome current swift swept long way could cross 
length reached still water near shore seeing landing place managed beach punt drag horses bank 
leaving craft drift time scuttle looked girths bridles mounted heading towards far column glowing smoke showed like beacon summit house fire 
first progress slow seemed path obliged pick way across fields search bridges spanned water ditches wide us jump 
hour spent work till came village wherein none stirring struck road seemed run towards mountain though learned afterwards took us many miles true path 
first time able canter pushed speed though fast wished spare horses feared lest might fall uncertain light 
dawn moon sank behind mountain gloom grew dense forced stop holding horses bridles allowing graze little young corn 
sky turned gray light faded column smoke guide dawn came blushing red upon vast snows distant peak shooting arrows loop pillar 
let horses drink channel watered corn mounting rode onward slowly 
shadows night weight fear seemed lifted hearts grew hopeful aye almost joyous 
hated city behind us 
behind us khania surging doom driven passions stormy loveliness wizardries horny eyed mentor old years secret sin madness strange half devil half martyr cruel coward khan husband polluted court 
front lay fire snow mystery hid sought many empty years 
would solve would die 
pressed forward joyfully meet fate whatever might 
many hours road ran deviously cultivated land peasants labor laid tools gathered knots watch us pass quaint flat roofed villages whence women snatched children fled sight us 
believed us lords court came work harm person property terror told us country smarted beneath rod oppressor 
mid day although peak seemed little nearer character land changed 
sloped gently upwards therefore could irrigated 
evidently great district dependent fall timely rains come spring 
therefore although population still dense every rod land plough spade crops failing 
pitiful see green uneared corn already turning yellow lack moisture beasts searching starved pastures food poor husbandmen wandering fields striving hoe iron soil 
people seemed know us two foreigners whose coming noised abroad fear famine made bold shouted us went give back rain stolen understood words 
even women children villages prostrated us pointing first mountain hard blue sky crying us send rain 
indeed threatened mob peasants armed spades reaping hooks seemed inclined bar path obliged put horses gallop pass rush 
went forward country grew ever arid inhabitants scarce till saw man save wandering herds drove cattle place place search provender 
evening guessed reached border tract harried mountain tribes strong towers built stone dotted heaths doubtless serve watch houses places refuge 
whether garrisoned soldiers know doubt saw none 
seems probable indeed forts relics days land kaloon guarded attack rulers different character present khan immediate predecessors 
length even watch towers left behind sundown found upon vast uninhabited plain could see living thing 
made minds rest horses awhile proposing push forward moon wrath khania behind us dare linger 
evening doubtless would discovered escape since sundown decreed leo must make choice give answer 
sure would strike swiftly 
perhaps messengers already work rousing country capture us soldiers following path 
unsaddled horses let refresh rolling sandy soil graze fashion upon coarse tufts withering herbage grew around 
water much matter drunk little muddy pool found hour 
finishing meal food brought us indeed needed sorely sleepless night long day journey horse knee haltered close hand lay roll 
could ease rope fore leg watched efforts idly till length fourth attempt hanging seconds upon back legs sticking straight air fell slowly towards horses 
hoofs red cut asked leo indifferent voice 
chanced also noticed red tinge first time since distinct animal frogs rolled thus seen 
rose look thinking probably evening light deceived us might passed ruddy colored mud 
sure enough red though dye soaked horn substance frogs 
gave pungent aromatic smell unpleasant smell might arise blood mixed musk spices 
strange said 
let us look beast leo 
found hoofs similarly treated 
perhaps native mixture preserve horn suggested leo 
thought awhile terrible idea struck 
want frighten said think better saddle get 
asked 
believe villain khan doctored horses 
make go lame leo make leave strong scent upon dry ground 
turned pale 
mean hounds nodded 
wasting time words saddled frantic haste 
fastened last strap saddle thought faint sound reached ear 
listen said 
came doubt 
sound baying dogs 
heaven death hounds said leo 
yes answered quietly enough crisis nerves hardened fear left friend khan hunting 
laughed 
shall asked leo 
leave horses looked peak 
nearest flanks miles miles away 
time enough forced 
never reach mountain foot run horses would hunt us spoor gaze 
man ride never rode 
sprang saddles gave rein turned looked behind 
remembered ridden long slope terminated ridge three miles away border great plain whereon stood 
sun sunk behind ridge although still light plain fallen shadow 
therefore distant object could seen upon plain anything crossing ridge remained visible enough clear air least persons keen sight 
saw 
ridge poured multitude little objects amongst last galloped man mounted great horse led another horse bridle 
pack said leo grimly rassen brought second mount 
see wanted us leave spears think shouted began gallop done shaman may prove true prophet 
away sped gathering darkness heading straight peak 
went calculated chances 
horses good land still strong fresh although ridden far pressed condition excellent 
doubtless death hounds fresh also meaning run us night thought might catch us sleeping rassen would brought along easily following us inquiry among peasants laying spoor last village left behind 
also two mounts aught knew though afterwards proved case wished work wickedness alone unseen might followed attendants relays 
therefore would appear unless reached place whither dare follow slopes peak many miles away must run us 
remained chance also dogs would tire refuse pursue chase 
however seemed scarcely probable extraordinarily swift strong savage scented blood doubtless horses hoofs steeped would fall dead exhaustion sooner abandon trail 
indeed khania simbri often told us much 
another chance might lose scent seeing nature probable 
even english pack carry trail red herring breast high without fault hours something stronger cunning compound tell tale odour would hold days 
last chance 
forced abandon horses riders might possibly escape could find place hide great plain 
seen well scented odds us often meanwhile three miles start perhaps help would come us mountain help unforeseen 
set teeth sped away like arrows light lasted 
soon failed whilst moon hidden behind mountains night grew dark 
hounds gained us gloom nothing dare ride full speed fearing lest horses stumble lame fall 
second time since dwelt land kaloon sudden fire flamed upon peak 
seen appeared flash across heavens one great lighthouse ray concentrated loop pillar night also ray ran far us like lance fire 
nearer fount found bathed soft mysterious radiance like phosphorescence summer sea reflected downwards perhaps clouds massy rock roof column loop diffused snows beneath 
unearthly glimmer faint helped us much indeed must overtaken ground rough full holes also made burrowing marmots 
thus extremity help come us mountain length moon rose quickly appeared volcanic fires vanished leaving behind nothing accustomed pillar dull red smoke 
commonplace speak music hounds chase often wondered music sounds ears deer fox fleeing life 
filled place quarry destiny solve problem assert confidence progeny earth produce hideous noise 
come near us desolate silence night hellish harmonies volume seemed terrific yet could discern separate notes composed especially one deep bell like bay 
remembered heard bay sat boat upon river saw poor noble done death crime loving khania 
hunt passed us observed burst throat leading hound huge brute red color coal black ear fangs gleamed like ivory mouth resembled hot oven 
even knew name beast afterwards khan whose peculiar joy pointed 
called master dog pack dared fight told could kill armed man alone 
baying warned us master half mile away coming moonlight enabled us gallop faster especially ground smooth covered short dry turf next two hours gained upon pack 
yes two hours perhaps less seemed score centuries 
slopes peak ten miles ahead horses giving last 
borne us nobly poor beasts though light weights yet strength limits 
sweat ran sides panted like bellows breathed gasps stumbled would scarcely answer flogging spear shafts 
gallop sank jolting canter thought soon must come dead stop 
crossed brow gentle rise ground sprinkled bush rocks sloped downwards miles us river ran bounding enormous flanks mountain 
traveled little way slope obliged turn order pass two heaps rock brought us side brow 
crossing three hundred yards away saw pack 
fewer doubtless many fallen hunt many still remained 
moreover far behind rode khan though second mount gone probably riding galloped first standstill 
poor horses saw also sight lent wings knew running lives 
could tell way quivered whenever baying came near horses tremble pleasureable excitement hunt extremity terror often seen prowling tiger roars close camp 
went though fresh stable fail another four miles covered river little way ahead could hear rush waters 
slowly surely pack overtook us 
passed clump bush gone couple hundred yards across open plain beyond feeling horses utterly spent shouted leo ride round back bush hide 
scarcely reached dismounted hounds came past 
yes went within fifty yards us lolloping along upon spoor running mute weary waste breath vain 
run said leo soon gone back scent presently set right across line hounds taken cut spoor 
hundred yards away rock fortunately able reach pack swung round upon horses tracks therefore view us 
stayed following loop came patch bush passed behind 
ran forward far could go 
glancing backwards went saw two poor foundered beasts plunging away across plain happily almost line along ridden rise 
utterly done freed weights urged fear could still gallop keep ahead dogs though knew would long 
saw also khan guessing done despair trying call hounds horses yet without avail would leave quarry viewed 
came sight flash remember picture well 
mighty snow clad peak surmounted column glowing smoke casting shadow mile upon mile across desert flats plain isolated rocks gray bushes doomed horses struggling across convulsive bounds trailing line great dogs loped amongst looking small lonely vast place figure khan horse black hide beflecked foam 
blue tender sky round moon shone clearly quiet level light detail even smallest could escape eye 
youth even middle age far behind although strong man years could run used 
also weary limbs stiff chafed long riding made slow progress worsen matters struck left foot stone hurt much 
implored leo go leave thought could reach river scent would lost water rate would give us chance life 
heard belling bay hound master waited next 
yes nearer us 
khan made cast found line 
presently must face end 
go go said 
keep back minutes may escape 
quest mine 
ayesha awaits weary life 
wish die done 
thus gasped broken words hobbled along clinging leo arm 
answered low voice quiet hear went dragging 
quite near water could see gleaming us oh longed one deep drink 
remember uppermost desire mind drink drink 
hounds nearer still us near could hear pattering feet dry ground mingled thud hoofs khan galloping horse 
reached rocks upon little rise bank began leo said suddenly use make 
stop let see thing 
wheeled round resting backs rock 
hundred yards death hounds heaven praised three 
rest followed flying horses doubtless caught last may far distant stopped gorge upon 
fight 
three khan wild figure galloped three black red brute master two others almost fierce big 
might worse said leo 
try tackle dogs best khan stooping rubbed palms grit wet water example followed 
gripped spears right hands knives left waited 
dogs seen us came growling baying fearfully 
rush came ashamed felt terribly afraid brutes seemed size lions fierce 
one smallest outstripped others leaping little rise sprang straight throat 
know impulse moment sprang meet whole weight came upon point spear backed weight 
spear entered forelegs shock knocked backwards 
regained feet saw dog rolling ground gnashing spear shaft twisted hand 
two jumped leo failed get hold though one tore away large fragment tunic 
foolishly enough hurled spear missed steel passed belly buried deep ground 
pair come 
perhaps sight dying companion made pause 
rate stood little distance snarling spears gone safe us 
khan ridden sat upon horse glowering us face like face devil 
hoped might fear attack moment saw eyes knew would 
quite mad hate jealousy long drawn excitement hunt come kill killed 
sliding saddle drew short sword either lost spear brought none made hissing noise two dogs pointing sword 
saw spring saw rush leo tell exactly happened knife went home hilt body one dog came ground lay hindquarters paralysed howling snarling biting 
fiend called master got right arm beneath elbow felt bones crack mighty jaws agony suppose caused drop knife weaponless 
brute dragged rock began shake worry although kicked stomach strength 
fell knees chanced left hand came upon stone size large orange gripped 
gained feet pounded skull stone still leave go well next hold would throat 
twisted tumbled fro man dog together 
one turn thought saw leo khan rolling upon ground another khan sitting stone looking came mind must killed leo watching dog worried death 
things began grow black something sprang forward saw huge hound lifted earth 
jaws opened arm came free fell side 
yes brute whirling round air 
leo held hind legs great strength whirled round round 
thud dashed head rock fell lay still huddled heap black red 
oddly enough faint suppose pain shock nerves kept awake heard leo say matter fact voice gasps breath well think fulfilled shaman prophecy 
let look make sure 
led one rocks resting supinely sat khan still living unable move hand foot 
madness quite left face looked us melancholy eyes like eyes sick child 
brave men said slowly strong also killed hounds broken back 
come foretold old rat 
hunted atene though lives avenge sake mine 
yellow beard hunts deadlier hounds thwarted passions 
forgive fly mountain yellow beard whither go one dwells stronger atene 
jaw dropped dead 
chapter xii messenger gone panted world lost much 
well give much poor devil let speak ill answered leo thrown exhausted ground 
perhaps right made mad 
rate pluck want tackle another 
manage asked 
dodged beneath sword closed threw smashed lump stone 
sheer strength 
cruel business life mine 
lucky finished time help oven mouthed brute tore throat 
ever see dog looks large young donkey 
much hurt horace oh forearm chewed pulp nothing else think 
let us get water drink soon shall faint 
also rest pack somewhere fifty 
think trouble us got horses poor beasts 
wait minute come 
rose found khan sword beautiful ancient weapon single cut keen edge killed second dog wounded still yowling snarling us 
collected two spears knife saying might useful without trouble caught khan horse stood hanging head close tired even desperate fight frightened away 
said go old fellow 
fit walk farther help climbed saddle 
slipping rein arm led horse walked stiffly river ran within quarter mile us though tortured pain half delirious exhaustion journey seemed long enough 
still came somehow forgetting wounds tumbled horse threw flat drank drank think ever 
life tasted anything delicious long draught water 
satisfied thirst dipped head made shift jerk wounded arm coolness seemed still pain 
presently leo rose water running face beard said shall river seems wide hundred yards low may deep water middle 
shall try cross case might drown stop till daylight take chance death hounds go another foot murmured faintly much less try ford unknown river 
thirty yards shore island covered reeds grasses 
perhaps could reach said 
come get back try 
obeyed difficulty set feeling way handle spear 
water proved quite shallow indeed never came much knees reached island without trouble 
leo laid soft rushes returning mainland brought black horse remaining weapons unsaddled beast knee haltered turned loose whereon immediately lay spent feed 
set work doctor wounds 
well proved sleeve garment thick even flesh forearm torn ribbons moreover bone seemed broken 
leo collected double handful soft wet moss washed arm wrapped round handkerchief laid moss 
second handkerchief strips linen torn undergarments fastened couple split reeds serve rough splints wounded limb 
suppose slept swooned 
rate remember 
sometime night leo strange dream told next morning 
suppose must dream certainly saw aware nothing 
well dreamed use words nearly possible heard accursed death hounds full cry 
nearer nearer came following spoor edge river pack run horses 
water brink halted mute 
suddenly puff wind brought scent us upon island one lifted head uttered single bay 
rest clustered made dash water 
leo could see hear everything 
felt doom hand yet held grip nightmare nightmare quite unable stir even cry wake warn 
followed marvel vision 
giving tongue came half swimming half plunging hounds drew near island slept 
suddenly leo saw longer alone 
front us brink water stood figure woman clad dark garment 
could describe face appearance back towards 
knew stood like guard holding object raised hand suddenly advancing hounds caught sight 
instant though paralysed fear bays turned fearful howlings 
one two nearest island seemed lose footing swept away stream 
rest struggled back bank fled wildly like whipped curs 
dark commanding figure dream leo took guardian spirit mountain vanished 
left footprints behind vouch morning looked see 
awakened sharp pangs arm opened eyes dawn breaking 
thin mist hung river island could see leo sleeping heavily side shape black horse risen grazing close hand 
lay still remembering undergone wondering live wake till presently murmuring water heard sound terrified sound voices 
sat peered reeds upon bank looking enormous mist saw two figures mounted upon horses woman man 
pointing ground though examined spoor sand 
heard man say something dogs daring enter territory mountain remark came back mind leo told dream 
remembered placed 
wake whispered leo 
wake pursued 
sprang feet rubbing eyes snatching spear 
upon bank saw sweet voice spoke mist saying lay weapon guest come harm 
voice khania atene man old shaman simbri 
shall horace asked leo something like groan whole world two people less wished see 
nothing answered play 
come us called khania across water 
swear mean harm 
alone know answered leo seems unlikely 
stop ready march 
atene spoke simbri 
said could hear whispered appeared arguing persuading course strongly disapproved 
suddenly put horses water rode us shallows 
reaching island dismounted stood staring 
old man seemed weary body oppressed mind khania strong beautiful ever passion fatigue left trace upon inscrutable face 
broke silence saying ridden fast far since last met guests left evil token mark path took 
yonder among rocks one lies dead 
say came end wound upon answered leo stretching hands 
knew answered blame fate decreed death fulfilled 
still must answer blood protect 
betray said leo 
khania seek answer given twelve hours gone 
remember speak alone save life aye clothe dead madman crown mantle 
shall answer yonder mountain said leo pointing peak us seek mine 
paled little replied find death told place guarded savage folk know pity 

death answer seek 
come horace let us go meet 
swear broke dwells woman dreams 
woman yes even man mine 
lady prove yonder upon mountain leo answered 
dwells woman atene went hurriedly nothing dwells

female voices began singing low conveying strange impression time distance 
followed bursts gladness alternating melancholy chords suggesting sighs tears sorrows long endured end joyous triumphant paean thrown fro men women singers terminating one united chorus repeated louder yet louder till culminated veritable crash melody sudden ceased

chapter xix leo leopard weeks followed momentous days often often wondered whether truly wretched ever lived woman spirit knew hes ayesha 
whether fact also imagination arisen ashes hideous age full bloom perpetual life beauty inconceivable 
things least certain ayesha achieved secret existence enduring human purposes might called unending 
within certain limitations utter inability foresee future undoubtedly also endued powers described supernatural

marvellous adventures man life might almost say soul whose mysteriously intertwined loved also intensest human passion woman capable sought hidden corner world 
thrice proved unalterable fidelity 
first rejection royal beautiful undisciplined atene 
secondly clinging ayesha seemed repulsive every natural sense 
thirdly homage scene sanctuary though unutterable perfections eyes appear wonderful steadfastness face terrible avowal true false gifts dim unholy pact powers evil unknown fruits consequences must involved price possession 
yet ayesha miserable 
even lightest moods clear skeletons feast spoken continual companions 
indeed alone would acknowledge dark hints veiled allegories allusions 
crushed though rival khania atene might also still jealous 
perhaps afraid would better word instinct seemed warn ayesha soon late hour would come atene would turn drink bitter waters despair

mystery may seen however faintly faces certain masterpieces greek sculptors ayesha clothed like ever present atmosphere suggesting glory earth making divine 
gazed wondered thus sudden became terribly agitated pointing shoulder mountain miles miles away said look looked saw nothing except sheet distant snow 
blind fool canst thou see lord danger life cried 
nay forgot thou hast vision 
take look laying hand strange numbing current seemed flow upon head muttered swift words 
instantly eyes opened upon distant mountain air saw leo rolling grips great snow leopard whilst chief huntsmen ran round round seeking opportunity pierce savage brute spears yet leave unharmed 
ayesha rigid terror swayed fro side till presently end came could see leo drive long knife bowels leopard grew limp separated struggle two bloodstained snow lay still 
rose laughing pointing rent garments whilst one huntsmen came forward began bandage wounds hands thigh strips linen torn robe 
vision vanished suddenly come felt ayesha leaning heavily upon shoulder like frightened woman heard gasp danger also passed many follow oh tormented heart long canst thou endure wrath flamed chief huntsmen summoned messengers sent speed litter ointments bidding bear back lord leo bring companions presence 
thou seest days mine holly aye many years said hounds shall pay agony

scolded yes scolded ayesha wishing know meant spying upon magic evil gift always disliked mistrusted condemning brave excellent men good friends death fiendish cruelty upon evidence rather temper evidence giving charge though little boy telling would answer hurt time killed every sort big game known passed perils encounters thus beat words wonderful say ayesha woman submitted chastisement meekly 
yet man dared address roughness even doubt speech life would come swift simultaneous end knew old could slay mere effort 
slay even threaten loving woman might done began cry 
yes great tears gathered lovely eyes rolling one one face fell head bent humbly forward like heavy raindrops marble floor 
sight touching evidence human loving heart leo anger melted 
grew penitent prayed pardon humbly 
gave hand token forgiveness saying let others speak sorry try thee leo bear harsh words 
oh thou art cruel cruel 
offended help spirit keeps watch upon thee indeed though thou knewest done ever since parted yonder place life help like mother sees little child play upon mountain edge soul torn agony know thee dangers powerless prevent share lives half wild huntsmen let weigh single breath thy safety seeing slew others would careful thee whereas slay fellows may even lead thee perils would bring thy death gasped horror word 
listen beloved said leo 
life humblest men much value mine thou hast right kill thou hast kill 
evil thou carest thou shouldst suffer thy love draw thee cruelty crime 
thou art afraid clothe immortality thine although dread somewhat holding thing unholy earth permitted faith still rejoice inherit thy dear sake knowing could never parted 
thou sayest yet thou canst let us wed take fortune gives us 
men must die least die shall happy thee yes single hour 
would dared ayesha answered little piteous motion hand 
oh urge leo lest last take risk lead thee dreadful road 
leo hast thou never heard love slays poison may lurk cup joy perfect though feared ayesha turned fled 
thus matter ended 
great one leo hurts mere scratches hunters instead killed promoted members body guard 
yet told us many things 
instance whenever chose ayesha power perceiving leo movements afar even communicating strength mental vision others although help predicament appeared power course accounted hideous ever present might anxiety 
think would one us mysteriously acquainted every open danger every risk sickness every secret peril best beloved must pass 
see rock trembling fall loitering beneath see drink water know full foulest poison see embark upon ship aware doomed sink able warn prevent 
surely mortal brain could endure constant terrors since hour hour arrows death flit unseen unheard past breasts us till length one finds home 
must ayesha suffered watching spirit eyes hair breadth escapes journeyings instance beginning saw leo house cumberland kill madness despair mighty effort superhuman wrung whatever power held fearful thraldom strength hurl soul across world thereby sleep reveal secret hiding place would find 
take one example many saw hanging slender thread yak hide face waterfall ice remained unable save even look forward single moment learn whether meet hideous death event must live alone dim age born 
sorrows ended material fears since others piercing must haunted 
imagine instance agonies jealous heart knew lover exposed temptations incident solitary existence especially ancient rival atene ayesha account wife 
imagine also fears lest time human change natural work degrees memory wisdom strength image loveliness faded thought desire company thus leaving endured long forgotten alone last 
truly power limited perceptions purest mercy otherwise us race would go mad perish raving terrors 
thus would seem ayesha great tormented soul thinking win life love eternal glorious truth another blind pandora 
stolen casket beauty super human power leapt bosom dwell unceasingly hundred torturing demons whose wings mere mortal kind feel far icy shadowing 
yes parallel might complete hope alone still lingered rifled chest 
chapter xx ayesha alchemy shortly incident snow leopard one demon familiars ayesha infinite ambition made formidable appearance 
dined evening ayesha habit discuss plans mighty unending future awful inheritance promised us 
must explain done already graciously informed notwithstanding refusal past years priceless opportunity also allowed bathe superannuated self vital fires though guise emerge like herodotus treats mysteries old egypt knew think lawful reveal 
secretly hoped outward man might change better prospect fixed ever shape present somewhat unpleasing personality appeal attractive 
truth far concerned matter academic rather actual interest take fairy tale since believe ever put kind immortality 
may add certain wished 
plans ayesha far reaching indeed terrific 
acquaintance modern world political social developments still strictly limited power follow growth activities certainly one made use 
practice knowledge seemed confined gathered brief talks took place us upon subject past time kor 
thirst information proved insatiable although true scarcely date seeing ever since lost touch civilized peoples namely last fifteen years much buried 
still able describe condition nations affairs period bade farewell less incorrectly draw maps various countries boundaries pondered long 
chinese people proved interested perhaps acquainted mongolian type like understood good many dialects 
also motive studies one night revealed us matter fact fashion 
read first part history left england published may remember found kor horrified us expressing determination possess great britain simple reason belonged country 
however like powers ideas grown purposed make leo absolute monarch world 
vain assure earnestly desired empire 
merely laughed said arise amidst peoples must rule peoples ayesha take second place among mortal men thou leo rulest yes mark truth thou art master therefore plain thou wilt master earth aye perchance others yet appear also know something think reach though hitherto mind way 
true life yet begun 
little space within world filled thought care thee waiting till thou wast born last years separation thou didst return 
months days preparation past endowed energy eternal wisdom ages strength bend mountains turn ocean bed begin 
oh sicken hour first like twin stars new firmament heaven break immortal splendor upon astonished sight men 
please tell thee leo please see powers principalities dominions marshalled kings governors bow thrones humbly crave liberty 
least added please little time seek higher things 
spoke radiance upon brow increased spread gleaming like golden fan slumbrous eyes took fire till thought became glowing mirrors saw pomp enthroned suppliant peoples pass 
asked leo something like groan vision universal rule viewed afar seem charm ayesha wilt thou bring things leo easily enough 
many nights listened wise discourses holly least thinks wise still much learn pored crooked maps comparing written memory late time study little matters 
also weighed pondered reports races world various follies futile struggling wealth small supremacies determined would wise kind weld one whole setting head direct destinies cause wars sickness poverty cease creatures little day ephemeridae word used may live happy cradle grave 
thy strange shrinking bloodshed however politic needful leo yet thou art true philosopher quickly done since command weapon would crush armouries whelm navies deep yes even lightnings nature elemental powers must obey 
thou shrinkest sight death thou believest heaven would displeased make chosen instrument heaven 
well let thy mine therefore tread gentler path 
wilt thou persuade kings earth place crowns upon thy head asked astonished 
causing peoples offer us answered suavely 
oh holly holly narrow thy mind strained quality thine imagination set poor gates ajar pray bethink thee 
appear among men scattering gold satisfy want clad terrifying power dazzling beauty immortality days cry ye monarchs rule us perhaps answered dubiously wilt thou appear took map eastern hemisphere drawn placing finger upon pekin said place shall home centuries say three five seven take long shape people liking purposes 
chosen chinese thou tellest numbers uncountable brave subtle patient though powerless ill ruled untaught able multitudes flood little western nations 
therefore among begin reign ages rest learn wisdom us thou holly makest armies unconquerable givest land good government wealth peace new religion 
new religion ask 
seemed unnecessary since convinced practice would prove form ayesha worship indeed mind occupied conjectures quaint absurd enough would happen first appearance ayesha china forgot subsidiary development future rule 
little western nations wait flooded suggested leo irritation contemptuous tone angered one prominent western nation 
combine instance attack thee first ah said flash eyes 
thought part hope chance since thou canst blame put strength 
oh east slept long shall awake shall awake upon battlefield battlefield history tell thou shalt see flaming standards sweep victory 
one one thou shalt watch nations fall perish length build thy throne upon hecatombs countless dead crown thee emperor world regenerate blood fire 
leo new gospel regeneration seemed appall fact hater absolute monarchies somewhat republican views sympathies continued argument took heed 
thing grotesque tremendous fantastic absurdity ayesha ambitions imperial minded madman could conceive 
yet came rub slightest doubt well able put practice carry marvellous awful conclusion 
death could touch triumphed death 
beauty cup madness eyes named reckless would compel hosts men follow 
piercing intelligence would enable invent new weapons highly trained army could possibly compete 
indeed might said one believed good reason proved held command elemental forces nature lie hid electricity would give living beings prey 
ayesha still woman enough worldly ambitions dread circumstance superhuman powers appeared unrestrained responsibility god man 
might well imagine fallen angel indeed hinted atene old shaman believed true place creation 
two things able discover could moved love leo small degree friendship 
yet devouring passion one man inexplicable endurance intensity would felt sure even future past prove heel achilles 
ayesha dipped waters dominion deathlessness human love left heart mortal might rendered harmless child otherwise would devastated universe 
right 
whilst still indulging reflections hoping ayesha would take trouble read mind became aware oros bowing earth 
thy business priest asked sharply leo ayesha like disturbed 
hes spies returned 
didst thou send asked indifferently 
need thy spies hes thou didst command 
well report hes grave 
people kaloon desperate drought caused crops fail starvation stares eyes lay charge strangers came land fled thee 
khania atene also mad rage thee holy college 
labouring night day gathered two great armies one forty one twenty thousand men latter sends mountain command uncle simbri shaman 
case defeated purposes remain second greater army plains kaloon 
tidings indeed said ayesha scornful laugh 
hate made woman mad dares thus match holly crossed thy mind mad boasting power perform 
well within six days thou shalt learn oh verily thou shalt learn though issue small fashion thou wilt doubt ever 
stay look though effort wearies spies may victims fears falsehoods atene 
suddenly common thus ayesha threw sight afar either indolence said exhausted rarely lovely face grew rigid like person trance light faded brow great pupils eyes contracted lost color 
little five minutes perhaps sighed like one awakening deep sleep passed hand across forehead though somewhat languid though strength left 
true enough said soon must stirring lest many people killed 
lord wouldst thou see war nay thou shalt bide safety whilst go forward visit atene promised 
thou goest go said leo angrily face flushing roots hair shame 
pray thee pray thee answered yet without venturing forbid 
talk hereafter 
oros away send round fire hes every chief 
three nights hence moonrise bid tribes gather nay twenty thousand best enough rest shall stay guard mountain sanctuary 
let bring food fifteen days 
join following dawn 
go
