salmon went tom warned wicked old otter tom went slowly cautiously coasting along shore 
many days many miles sea perhaps would never found way fairies guided without seeing fair faces feeling gentle hands 
went strange adventure 
clear still september night moon shone brightly water could sleep though shut eyes tight possible 
last came top sat upon little point rock looked broad yellow moon wondered thought looked 
watched moonlight rippling river black heads firs silver frosted lawns listened owl hoot snipe bleat fox bark otter laugh smelt soft perfume birches wafts heather honey grouse moor far felt happy though could well tell 
course would cold sitting september night without least bit clothes wet back tom water baby therefore felt cold fish 
suddenly saw beautiful sight 
bright red light moved along river side threw water long tap root flame 
tom curious little rogue must needs go see swam shore met light stopped shallow run edge low rock 
underneath light lay five six great salmon looking flame great goggle eyes wagging tails much pleased 
tom came top look wonderful light nearer made splash 
heard voice say fish rose 
know words meant seemed know sound know voice spoke saw bank three great two legged creatures one held light flaring sputtering another long pole 
knew men frightened crept hole rock could see went 
man torch bent water looked earnestly said tak muckle fellow lad ower fifteen punds haud hand steady 
tom felt danger coming longed warn foolish salmon kept staring light bewitched 
could make mind came pole water fearful splash struggle tom saw poor salmon speared right lifted water 
behind sprang three men three men shouts blows words tom recollected heard shuddered turned sick felt somehow strange ugly wrong horrible 
began come back 
men fighting savage desperate fighting tom seen many times 
stopped little ears longed swim away glad water baby nothing horrid dirty men foul clothes backs foul words lips dared stir hole rock shook head trampling struggling keepers poachers 
sudden tremendous splash frightful flash hissing still 
water close tom fell one men held light hand 
swift river sank rolled current 
tom heard men run along seemingly looking drifted deep hole lay quite still could find 
tom waited long time till quiet peeped saw man lying 
last screwed courage swam 
perhaps thought water made fall asleep 
went nearer 
grew curious could tell

went carefully peeping round rocks hiding roots 
mr grimes lay still turned water baby 
afternoon tom went back 
could rest till found become mr grimes 
time mr grimes gone tom made mind turned water baby 
might made easy poor little man mr grimes turn water baby anything like one

quite certain man becomes confirmed poacher way cure put water twenty four hours like grimes 
grow big man behave honest fellows never touch fish head game belongs another man without express leave people call gentleman treat like one perhaps give good sport instead hitting river calling poaching snob 
tom went afraid staying near grimes went vale looked sad 
red yellow leaves showered river flies beetles dead gone chill autumn fog lay low upon hills sometimes spread thickly river could see way 
felt way instead following flow stream day day past great bridges past boats barges past great town wharfs mills tall smoking chimneys ships rode anchor stream ran hawsers wondered peeped saw sailors lounging board smoking pipes ducked terribly afraid caught man turned chimney sweep 
know fairies close always shutting sailors eyes lest see turning aside millraces sewer mouths foul dangerous things 
poor little fellow dreary journey longed back vendale playing trout bright summer sun 
could 
never come 
people little babies even water babies lives 
besides people make minds go see world tom must needs find weary journey 
lucky lose heart stop half way instead going bravely end tom 
remain neither boys men neither fish flesh good red herring learned great deal much yet enough sown wild oats without advantage reaping 
tom always brave determined little english bull dog never knew beaten held till saw long way red buoy fog 
found surprise stream turned round running inland 
tide course tom knew nothing tide 
knew minute water fresh turned salt round 
came change 
felt strong light fresh veins run champagne gave know three skips water yard high head heels salmon first touch noble rich salt water wise men tell us mother living things 
care tide 
red buoy sight dancing open sea buoy would go went 
passed great shoals bass mullet leaping rushing shrimps never heeded passed great black shining seal coming mullet 
seal put head shoulders water stared looking exactly like fat old greasy negro gray pate 
tom instead frightened said ye sir beautiful place sea old seal instead trying bite looked soft sleepy winking eyes said good tide little man looking brothers sisters passed play outside 
oh said tom shall playfellows last swam buoy got upon quite breath sat looked round water babies none seen 
sea breeze came freshly tide blew fog away little waves danced joy around buoy old buoy danced 
shadows clouds ran races bright blue bay yet never caught breakers plunged merrily upon wide white sands jumped rocks see green fields inside like tumbled broke pieces never minded bit mended jumped 
terns hovered tom like huge white dragon flies black heads gulls laughed like girls play sea pies red bills legs flew fro shore shore whistled sweet wild 
tom looked looked listened would happy could seen water babies 
tide turned left buoy swam round round search vain 
sometimes thought heard laughing laughter ripples 
sometimes thought saw bottom white pink shells 
sure found one saw two bright eyes peeping sand
