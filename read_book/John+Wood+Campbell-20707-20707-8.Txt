essence magazine name philosophy purpose 
old amazing stories long since gone magazine name today different times today different world 
science fiction new atomic energy dream believed space travel something tried understand better 
today science fiction become broad field atomic energy despite feelings many present adults dream 
nightmare simply fact calling nightmare another form effort push reality 
audience science fiction among still young enough spirit willing hope speculate new wider future meant almost nothing teen agers 
meant brightest group teen agers youngsters willing play ideas understandings physics chemistry astronomy contemporaries considered hard work 
grew group stories wrote years later stories bought astounding science fiction changed grew mature 
astounding science fiction today many audience read early stories high school college students course professional engineers technologists researchers 
naturally need totally different kind story 
growing work lose much enthusiastic scope went earlier science fiction 
young man goes college apt say want scientist want engineer concepts broad generalized 
major technical schools well knowing first year course students 
second subsequent years specialization start 
sophomore year student may say want chemical engineer 
graduation may say going chemical engineering construction 
ten years later may explain chemical engineer specializing construction corrosion resistant structures electroplating baths pickling tanks stainless steel 
year year knowledge become specialized much deeper 
better better able important work world needs done learning necessarily lost broad enthusiastic scope 
early stories early days science fiction 
radar invented missed idea 
stories finesse later work bounding enthusiasm belongs young field designed built young men 
writers early stories like college students 
piracy preferred written sophomore mit old timers science fiction typical days field starting 
got fine flavor younger enthusiasm 
new readers science fiction stuff laid groundwork today work stories meant young imaginations people wanted think world build years come 
along sixteen nineteen young man decide job needs get ready get pitch 
selects well selects understanding foresight pick job need one return rewards satisfaction well money 
man pick must choose job feels fitting 
crystal balls bought fairly reasonably work well 
history books bought even cheaply moderately reliable 
though necessarily filtered cultural attitudes man wrote 
work well predicting machines world changing rapidly 
world today instance needs engineers desperately 
lot jobs nation would like get done even started enough engineers available 
fifty years ago engineering student sort second class citizen college campus 
today liberal arts fighting come back pendulum swung considerably far direction 
science fiction real function teen agers presents varying ideas world live adult life interested 

son graduate 
period peak earning power forty sixty say 
progress made understanding health physical vigor apt run beyond ad however 
anyone want bet people living general circumstances general social cultural material standards apply hunch history books poor way planning life today science fiction comes lot closer 
another thing science fiction yarns quite conspicuous difficult pick villains 
might made quite change history ballads tales old days little less sure villains 
read standard boy literature forty years ago tales crusaders always right saracens always wrong 
saracens taught christians respect philosophy greeks introduced basic ideas straight self disciplined thinking life much simpler thatched cottage dome airless moon easier understand villains pure black hearted villains heroes pure white souled heroes 
look simple history compared science fiction simple good early science fiction tales explored universe probings speculations could go

pirate spoken truth 
woman suffering cancer free pain first time many months 
later careful examination proved cured papers issuing extras within five minutes time great plane landed radio news service broadcasting first break particularly dead month 
june news dead july begun bang time think investigate airport officials went ship air guard using fine tooth comb 
soon evident job done outside pirate said 
emergency pilot testified entered ship found small piece wire securing air lock outside 
certainly put ship flight meant whoever done landed great ship small plane somehow anchored entered plane air lock ten mile height 
probably flown across path plane leaving trail gas way drawn ventilator pumps 
washed incoming good air later emergency pilot affected 
investigation led mail room 
despite refractory nature metal door opened melting burning lock 
opening burned safe opened melting bond shipment due next day airline officials planned watch 
would get safely sure men put board steel chambers hermetically welded behind oxygen tanks automatic apparatus sealed within supply clean air 
front tanks equipped bullet proof glass windows means electrically operated controls men inside could fire machine guns 
thus protected pirate gas able use weapons 
ship accompanied patrol air guardsmen 
yet despite cancer cases aboard hope gassed 
plane reached neighborhood san francisco sign attack 
pirate might well retire permanently million alone singular signature indicated seemed much probable would attempt another attack case 
well meant watching planes tremendous job air guard handle 
leader patrol turned easy bank descend ten miles earth planes followed 
suddenly communicator came unmistakable sound 
plane automatically signaling emergency pilot could mean plane gassed eyes men bonds gone passengers gassed incredibly men steel tanks thoroughly gassed rest

blue tendrils smoke pipes rose slowly drawn away efficient ventilating system 
taller two seemed talking 
positions assumed would rather difficult sure taller robert morey good four inches taller richard arcot 
arcot suffer stigma runt morey around six feet tall 
chosen occupation physical research field arcot could well called morey runt arcot one competitor father 
case like father like son 
many years robert arcot known greatest american physicist probably world greatest 
recently known father world greatest physicist 
arcot junior probably one brilliant men world ever seen aided work two men could help way amplified powers thousand fold 
father best friend morey complimentary balancing minds great intelligence 
father learned years work easiest best ways performing many difficult feats laboratory experimentation 
morey could develop mathematical theory hypothesis far readily arcot could 
morey mind methodical exact arcot arcot could grasp broad details problem get general method solution developed speed made utterly impossible friend even follow steps suggested 
since arcot junior invention multiple calculus many new ramifications old theories attained many developments become possible 
factor made arcot amazingly successful line work ability see practical uses things ability unfortunately lacking many great physicists 
collected royalties inventions merited would billionaire twice thrice 
instead made contracts basis laboratories owned kept condition paid salary whatever happened need 
since sold inventions transcontinental airways able devote time science leaving manage finances 
perhaps fact sell inventions transcontinental made lines successful rate president arthur morey duly grateful son able enter laboratories delighted arcot 
two become boon companions 
worked played lived thought together 
talking pirate 
seventh day discovery growing steadily menacing 
great transcontinental airways suffered repeatedly 
sometimes san francisco flyer went without pilot sometimes new york st louis expresses would come field broadcasting emergency signal 
always people revived little difficulty time stock piracy inc accumulated 
air guard seemed helpless 
time time pirate slipped undetected 
time convinced outside job door always sealed outside 
dick suppose gets away things right eyes air guardsmen must system every time 
vague idea arcot answered 
going ask today father would let us take passage next liner carrying money 
understand insurance rates boosted high dare send cash air 
resorted slow land routes 
money shipment sight morey shook head 
something good better purpose 
day several men came dad office charter plane san francisco dad naturally wondered referred president company 
seems difficulty wanted hire ship could robbed large group medical men cancer victims going treatment 
one twenty five hundred going bring along one hundred dollars 
meant total quarter million dollars left table 
hoped pirate would gas thus cure dad officially told many people san francisco express two sections would necessary 
believe going second section 
one hundred dollars low price cancer cure another thing dad asked tell appreciate help stopping ultra modern pirate 
go see morning doubtless able make necessary arrangements 
gladly 
wonder though know 
try c l mask animal pirate telling truth 
tried dog went sleep forever 
idea gas arcot shook head 
know gas lead works 
may know carbon monoxide seep solid plate red hot steel 
known three hundred years hand pirate making use 
even war find practical application principle 
found gas induces sleep low concentrations time able penetrate even greater extent carbon monoxide 
wondering stores stuff morey commented 
suppose makes fast uses allowing two constituents react 
might well simple enough store separately air stream blowing past would carry gas behind permitting lay stream front big plane 
figured 
one things want go invalid special tomorrow get samples analysis 
pretty big order dick going handle even get apparatus easily enough far getting sample goes 
already sample bottles made 
one lab excuse moment 
arcot left room return minutes later large aluminum bottle tightly closed 
bottle pumped good vacuum 
swept helium gas 
pumped 
hope take gas filled region gas able leak air comes going gas fight air pressure probably stay 
hope works 
would help knew bucking 
next morning arcot long conference president morey 
end left office ascended roof climbed small helicopter 
rose local traffic level waiting chance broke stream planes bound great airfields jersey district 
minutes later landed roof transcontinental airways shops entered went office designing engineer john fuller old schoolmate 
able help fuller paid much attention theoretical physics might though probably one outstanding aeronautical designers often consulted arcot theoretical details needed 
probably arcot derived greatest benefit association ability designer many times brought theoretical successes practical commercial production 
however consulting fuller plane take afternoon san francisco slightly changed 
stayed fuller office better part hour returned roof thence roof morey junior waiting 
hello dick heard dad going afternoon came 
got note things fixed 
plane leaves one ten thirty 
let eat lunch start 
half past eleven reached flying field 
went directly private office assigned aboard huge plane 
right next mail room wall two small hole cut 
directly beneath hole table two men set small moving picture camera brought 
many gas sample bottles bring bob asked arcot 
jackson four ready brought 
think enough 
got camera properly placed everything ok believe 
nothing wait 
time passed heard faint whir ventilator machinery started 
drew air outside pumped necessary pressure breathing ship matter external pressure might 
larger pump attached similarly engines supply necessary oxygen 
loss power pumping air made lower back pressure exhaust 
engines starting could feel momentary vibration vibration would cease got way 
could visualize airtight door closed portable elevator backing returning field house 
arcot glanced watch 
one clock 
starting signal due 
morey sank back comfortable chair 
well nice long wait till get san francisco back dick something talk hope bob hope return midnight plane san francisco get us nine clock tomorrow morning new york time 
wish go right father office ask place supper see fuller come 
think able use molecular controller job almost finished need good designing engineer 
little movie show doubt interest low rumble quickly mounted staccato roar great propellers began whirling engines took load 
ground began flash behind suddenly flying speed reached slight start roaring bark engine took deeper tone rocking stopped ground dropped away 
like mighty wild bird plane air graceful sentient thing wheeling great circle headed san francisco 
plane climbed steadily long bank went gradually terrific roar engine died low throbbing hum low pressure air silenced noise 
giant city contracted great ship rode higher 
tiny private helicops darting like streams nigh invisible individuals creeping black lines among buildings city 
towering buildings shone noon sun riotous hues colored tile facing reflected brilliant sunlight glowing warmth color 
city indescribable beauty 
one things made trip worthwhile 
shining city dropped behind soft green jersey hills deep purple black sky visible 
sun blazed high nigh black heavens rarefied air little diffusion corona readily visible aid smoked glass 
around sun long banners space zodiacal light gleamed dimly 
brighter stars winked dark sky 
landscape swung slowly 
even men made trip dozens times sight fascinating inspiring 
spectacle never visible development super planes 
whole flying observatories made taken photographs heights fifteen miles air rarefied plane travel close eight hundred miles hour remain aloft 
already ahead arcot morey could see great splotch color chicago mightiest city earth 
situated heart north american continent great water ground landing facilities broad plains made perfect airport 
sea longer meant much source power recreation food 
ships longer needed 
planes faster economical hence seacoast cities declined importance 
already great start toward ascendancy chicago rapidly forged ahead air lines developed great super planes 
european planes docked starting point south american lines 
swung high glistening walls soft colored tiles made great mass changing flashing color beneath 
could see great air liner twice size plane taking japan six giant propellers visible flashing blurs climbed toward 
sight 
green plains nebraska pirate usually worked men became alert waiting first sign abnormal drowsiness 
sat quietly talking listening intently new note knowing sound pirate might make would concealed whirring roar air sweeping past giant airfoils plane 
suddenly arcot realized unbearably sleepy 
glanced drowsily toward morey already lying 
found tremendous effort make reach close switch started little camera whirring almost noiselessly 
seemed never pulled arm back lay white uniformed man bending opened eyes 
one side saw morey smiling 
fine guard arcot 
thought going stay awake watch oh left much efficient watchman go sleep willing bet may gone sleep doctor tells gone somewhere else 
found room woke 
think pirate found confiscated 
luggage including gas sample bottles gone 
right 
arranged 
ship brought emergency pilot instructions father 
took care luggage member pirate gang could steal 
might ground crew 
turned us soon see emergency man 
lie longer doctor dr arcot right 
would suggest next hour take easy let heart get used beating 
stopped two hours know 
right however 
ii five men seated morey library discussing results last raid particular related arcot morey 
fuller president morey well dr arcot senior two young men 
consistently refused tell trip revealed saying pictures would speak 
turned attention motion picture projector screen arcot junior set 
direction room darkened started projector 
looking three dimensional image mail room aboard air liner 
arcot commented cut lot useless film confined picture essentials 
watch pirate work 
even spoke saw door mail room open bit intense surprise remained open seconds closed 
went motions opening admit someone yet one entered demonstration seem show much yet son 
fact shows much less expected said senior arcot 
door seemed open easily 
thought locked pirate burned holes save property leave em unlocked 
scene seemed swing bit plane hit unusually bad air bump window caught glimpse one circling air guardsmen 
suddenly appeared air within room point flame 
hung air safe instant described strangely complicated set curves hung instant mid air became great flare 
instant condensed point intensely brilliant crimson fire 
described complex series curves touched top safe 
inconceivably short time eight inch thickness tungsto iridium alloy flared incandescently began flow sluggishly 
large circle red flame sprang surround point brilliance blew molten metal one side cascade sparks 
moments torch cut large disc metal nearly free seemingly verge dropping safe 
flame left safe retracting uncanny manner force seeming either supply fuel support thus though burned steadily worked rapidly efficiently 
mid air hung second 
going work projector moments hand may see next bit film 
arcot moved small switch machine blinked giving strange appearance seemingly solid images thrown screen 
pictures seemed show flame slowly descending till touched metal 
tungsto iridium glowed briefly suddenly extinguishing light safe gone disappeared thin air incandescence metal flame visible 
seems pirate solved secret invisibility 
wonder air guardsmen find exclaimed arcot senior 
projector stopped exactly first frame showing invisibility safe 
arcot backed 
true dad said pay special attention next frame 
appeared picture room window beyond mail clerk asleep desk everything except safe shadowy half visible safe metal glowing brightly 
beside visible shadowy man holding safe shadowy bar sort 
frame window perfectly visible ironically air guardsman plane 
seems instant invisibility failed 
probably contact safe caused 
think dad asked arcot junior 
seem reasonable 
see hand invisibility even theoretically possible 
ideas well dad want wait till tomorrow night demonstrate 
let adjourn meeting come tomorrow 
next evening however seemed arcot could 
asked morey junior tell would later finished lab 
dinner men waiting rather impatiently arcot come 
heard noise corridor looked one entered 
morey asked fuller learn gas pirate using remember arcot said would samples analyze 
gas dick found little already known 
typical organic compound one metal radical type contains one atom thorium 
bit radioactive know dick thinks may account part ability suspend animation 
however since impossible determine molecular weight could say gas save empirical formula c th h n 
broke temperature centigrade 
gases left consisted largely methane nitrogen methyl ether 
dick still dark gas 
paused exclaimed look men turned one accord toward opposite end room looked seeing nothing particularly unusual glanced back rather puzzled 
saw better failed see puzzled still 
morey disappeared ohhh quick work dick senior arcot began laughing heartily astonished curious companions looked toward stopped called come dick want see 
tell us done rather think mr morey mean visible one still bit puzzled 
short laugh air certainly could nothing else low distinct click morey arcot miraculously present coming instantaneously nowhere one senses could relied 
arcot back strapped large rather hastily wired mechanism one long wire extending laboratory 
carrying second piece apparatus similarly wired 
morey touching short metal bar arcot held extended hand using table knife connector lest get radio frequency burns making contact 
busy getting last connection portable apparatus rigged 
thing working order see rather see 
outfit thing important us 
bit heavy clear space set 
look power supply wire carrying rather dangerously high emf connect lab power supply time rig little mechanism like one pirate must 
duplicated experiment 
simply made use principle known time need used 
found back early days radio early first quarter twentieth century short wavelengths effected peculiar changes metals 
shown plates tubes working short waves became nearly transparent 
waves short however economically useless 
would travel usable paths never developed 
furthermore existing apparatus could made handle 
last war tried apply idea making airplanes invisible could get tubes handle power needed drop 
however tube recently got market possible get 
friend pirate developed thing point could use 
see invisibility interesting good thing stage television entertainment much commercial need 
one wants invisible honest occupation 
invisibility tremendous weapon war pirate started little private war way could make money invention 
gas made thing attractive 
two together made perfect combination criminal operations 
whole thing looks work slightly unbalanced mind 
violently insane probably one particular obsession 
scientific bump certainly shows sign weakness 
might even new type kleptomaniac 
steals things already stolen far man could ever need leaves place stock certificate company 
violent carefully warned men use c l mask remember careful instructions revive people developed machine invisibility naturally fly air guard without knowing provided microphonic detectors locate 
believe uses form glider 
use internal combustion engine explosions cylinders would visible though cylinders made clear quartz 
electric motor storage cells would weigh much 
furthermore using sort prop jet engine noise would give away 
used glider noise big plane near would enough kill slight sounds 
glider could hang ship dive upon passed beneath 
simple system anchoring thing discovered sorrow 
powerful electro magnet turns lands 
landing deck big plane right office aboard found watch sorts antics today 
lost hour morning afternoon gained two 
found highly magnetized could pick needles balance wheel 
demagnetized runs right 
get back anchors ship leaving invisible goes air lock enters 
wears high altitude suit back portable invisibility set fuel torch 
gas already put everyone sleep goes ship still invisible melts open safe 
power supply invisibility machine seems somewhat problem think would use cylinder liquid air small air turbine run high voltage generator 
probably uses system larger scale run big machine ship 
use engine either 
torch interesting 
atomic hydrogen welding time atomic hydrogen releases calories per mole molecular hydrogen two grains gas give one hundred thousand calories 
oxygen prepared commercial quantity atomic state 
watching man torch color flame indications gather uses flame atomic oxygen atomic hydrogen melting surrounds preheating jacket atomic hydrogen 
center flame probably develops temperature centigrade naturally make tungsten alloy run like water 
machine said machine impresses high frequencies body connected 
puts molecules vibration frequency approaching light light impinges upon pass readily 
know metals transmit light short distances order light pass molecules metal must set harmonic vibration rate approaching frequency light 
impress vibration piece matter transmit light freely 
impress vibration matter say body electrically get effect body becomes perfectly transparent 
since vibration molecules makes light pass material must stopped wish see machine 
obviously much easier detect among solid surroundings plane high sky 
chance one detect machine perfectly transparent nothing perfectly transparent air around curious property vibrational system invisibility index refraction made low 
air difference slight practically within limits observation error small difference rainbow effect 
difference temperature air would give equal effect 
since vibration induced radio impulse possible impress another opposing radio impulse overcome tendency bring invisible object field visible machine table designed exactly 
practically beam radio set projecting beam wavelength alone would tend produce invisibility 
case make visible 
going stand right bob operate set 
arcot strode middle room morey turned reflector beam set 
low snap arcot turned set gone suddenly coming darkness lamp extinguished 
one moment staring chair behind knowing man standing knowing looking body 
gave strange feeling uncomfortable tingling along spine 
voice seemed come air disembodied ghost invisible man called morey 
right bob turn slowly 
another snap switch disrupter beam turned 
noticeable fogginess air arcot 
power turned machine saw man materialize thin air 
first mere shadowy outline never fully level conscious vision 
slowly outlines objects behind became dimmer dimmer body man slowly darkened till last wavering aura 
snap morey shut machine arcot gone 
second snap solid 
shut apparatus 
see intend locate invisible pirate 
course depend directional radio disturbance locating devices determine direction invisibility disrupter ray 
probably marvelling greatness genius design construct apparatus one day 
explain miracle 
working short wave phenomena time 
fact actually made invisibility machine morey testify realized commercial benefits experiment beyond laboratory stunt stage 
published theory journal international physical society surprised learn pirate based discovery report 
still working somewhat different piece apparatus believe find relevant business 
ask adjourn tonight meeting another twenty four hours till finish apparatus working 
important fuller 
going need work follow 
another problem design works hope 
certainly make every effort arcot fuller assured 
promise tough problem well interesting one 
arcot smiled 
thing works expect job certainly feather cap 
also change 
well inducement certainly 
think pirate could give us hints design 
get glider ten miles done high altitude gliding already 
distance record took someone across atlantic seems ten miles straight bit steep glider 
vertical air currents height 
meant say machine true glider semi glider 
probably goes ten miles aid small engine one small probably takes half day get 
would easy plane pass lower traffic lanes invisible mount high wait air liner 
use large engine would drag one new hundred horsepower jobs would weigh fifty pounds 
think draw pretty good picture plane scientific logic 
probably tremendous wingspread high angle incidence make possible glide height engine prop almost laughably small 
next evening men got together dinner considerable speculation nature discovery arcot going announce even father knowledge 
two men worked separate laboratories except either particularly difficult problem might solved 
knew new development lay field short wave research could find way concerned problem hand 
last meal arcot ready demonstrate 
dad believe trying develop successful solar engine 
one could placed wings plane generate power light falling surface 
solar engines greatest problem solved well investigate thing wonder greatest 
surprising number annoying problems met 
say though one big trouble solar engines eliminating obvious restriction decidedly dependable night work difficulty getting area absorb energy 
could get enough area could use low efficiency still cheap power power absolutely free 
area problem greatest difficulty doubt 
well arcot junior said quietly think fairly good area use harness energy absorbs 
really developed efficient solar engine 
engine requires absorbing area want use takes advantage fact earth absorbing quintillions horsepower 
merely tapped power earth already absorbed 
come 
led way corridor laboratory switched lights 
main laboratory bench set complicated apparatus many tubes heavy bus bar connectors 
final tube two thin wires ran long tubular coil 
left coil large relay switch rheostat control 
turn relay dad slowly rotate controller left 
remember rather powerful know look like solar engine nine clock night seems peculiar hour demonstrate thing guarantee results probably expect 
dr arcot stepped controls closed switch 
lights dimmed bit immediately brightened end room came low steady hum big transformer took load 
well sound ten kw transformer engine efficient ought get terrific amount power 
dr arcot smiling amusedly son 
well control except standing directly front suppose know 
oh laboratory model gotten thing shape really 
look conductors lead coil certainly carrying ten kw dr arcot slowly rotated rheostat 
faint hum coil gone 
seemed result 
rotated bit slight draught sprang within room 
waited nothing startling occurred gave rheostat sharp turn 
time absolutely doubt result 
roar like fifty foot wind tunnel mighty blast cold air swept coil like six inch model kansas cyclone 
every loose piece paper laboratory came suddenly alive whirled madly blast air suddenly leaped 
dr arcot forced back giant hand backward motion hand lifted relay switch thud circuit opened 
instant roar sound cut soft whisper air told furious blast moment 
astonished physicist came forward looked device moment silence men watched 
finally turned son smiling twinkle eye 
dick think loaded dice way even lucrative method ever invented principle machine think certainly solved secret sufficiently absorbing area solar engine 
well remarked elderly morey shivering bit chill air room loaded dice long noted ability make money see explains working model arctic tornado 
burr still cold 
think need considerable area heat absorption sun engine certainly cool things secret principle easy enough considerable difficulty application 
think going rather important though rather important broke inventor father rare display excitement 
considerably 
biggest thing since electric dynamo puts airplanes junk heap means new era power generation 
never worry power make interplanetary travel possible commercially economical 
arcot junior grinned broadly 
dad seems think machine possibilities seriously believe antiquate types airplanes prop jet 
direct utilization energy sun kindly supplying 
good many years men trying find control energy atoms air travel release energy constitution matter 
sun already scale gargantuan could never hope desire approach 
three million tons matter go colossal furnace every second time comes two half decillion ergs energy 
total two half million billion billion billions ergs draw man nothing worry good many years come represents flood power vaster man could comprehend 
try release energy use may well tap vast ocean power 
one thing prevents us getting law probability 
dad mentioned loaded dice dice know classical example probability loaded 
loaded law still holds conditions changed make problem quite different 
arcot paused frowning resumed half apologetically excuse lecture know else get thought across 
familiar conditions liter helium gas container tremendous number molecules dashing along several miles second equal number dashing opposite direction equal speed 
thickly packed none go far runs another molecule bounces new direction 
good chance molecules happen move direction time one old physicists einstein time man named eddington expressed well army monkeys playing typewriters might write books british museum 
chance decidedly favorable chance molecules liter gas move direction time 
improbability chance thing making problem appear impossible 
similarly would improbable impossible according law chance throw string aces indefinitely 
impossible unless force influences happening 
dice bits iridium stuck six spots throw aces 
chance makes impossible molecules gas move direction time unless stack chances 
find way influence may 
would happen metal bar molecules decided move direction time heat motion normally carrying rate several miles second go one way entire bar must move direction start velocity great velocity individual molecules 
attach bar heavy car try start forced drag car able molecules moving rate 
slowed starting mass car 
slowly moving molecules definite physical significance 
molecules move temperature lack motion means lack heat 
molecules slowed cold absorb heat air since molecule hydrogen gas room temperature moving seven miles second molecules confined gas car molecules metal bar slowed hundred miles hour temperature drops hundreds degrees zero absorb energy rapidly greater difference temperature greater rate heat absorption 
believe able accelerate car rapidly speed several miles second high altitudes able use perfectly enclosed streamlined car get tremendous speeds 
need wings course small unit pointed vertically able support car air 
make possible machine able fly reverse come quick stop 
steer us supply us electrical power merely put series small metal bars circumference generator get tremendously powerful engine 
present need means tremendously powerful engine one make invisible 
believe guess source breeze would make wonderful air conditioning unit 
dick arcot began morey voice tight suppressed excitement would like able use invention 
know enough economics thing science know apparatus us absolutely invaluable 
afford buy rights want use let 
means new era transcontinental air travel turned sharply fuller 
fuller want help arcot ship chase pirate 
get contract design new airliners 
hang cost 
run billions fuel bills oil bills cost operation negligible 
nothing arcot short wave tubes buy one good twenty five thousand hours service get rights want course said arcot quietly 
maintaining laboratories son helped work 
fuller move tomorrow help things lot 
also like best mechanics make necessary machines start power units 
done morey snapped 
iii early next morning fuller moved equipment laboratory set table work 
arcot morey joined designing new machine started 
first let get idea advisable shape fuller began methodically 
want streamlined course roughly speaking cylinder modified fit special uses put 
probably general plan mind arcot 
suppose sketch us 
big physicist frowned thoughtfully 
well know much yet work 
plenty fun figuring strains machine let safe use factor safety five 
let see need 
first place machine must proof pirate gas riding beam instruments guide us safely pass 
thought think best system used sample bottles vacuum 
gas stopped nothing speak substance stop doubt penetrate outer shell reaching vacuum tend stay inner outer walls 
collect since fighting air pressure going either 
pressure inside force back pressure outside force 
pump would soon build pressure enough penetrate interior wall 
since stuff leak material kind pump shall use pushed piston leak either cylinder walls piston 
centrifugal pump would equally ineffective 
mercury vapor pump take course keep high vacuum never make progress 
new machine gives us answer 
number openings wall outer shell set one molecular motion directors direct molecules outside air 
come go morey objected vacuum keeps gas also keep heat well since generator run heat energy rather chilly inside remedy 
course power units could placed outside blast air warm really good streamline effect hang big electric generator outside 
thought arcot answered 
solution obvious bring generator air must bring air 
began sketching rapidly pad power equipment room back control room front 
relays controlling back control electrically operation power equipment warm gas tight room 
gets warm cool using little heat help accelerate ship 
cold turn electric heater run generator 
air generator come small sort scoop top leave small opening rear 
vacuum tail assure us rapid circulation even centrifugal pump action enclosed generator enough 
thoughts began moving rapidly words 
want generator greatly power run tests greater range 
need one hundred kilowatts altogether install thousand ac course 
batteries keel starting generator self supporting rolling let set actual figures 
rest day three men working general plan new ship calculating strengths needed supplementing mathematics actual experiments machines hand 
calculating machines busy continuously rules experience could give 
developing something entirely new though designing staff three foremost mathematicians world problem tested ingenuity utmost 
evening first day however able give finished designs power units mechanics make 
order storage battery standard electrical equipment placed 
time completed drawings mail casting materials already assembled little private camp morey owned hills vermont 
giant freight helicopters could land readily wide field cleared small plateau center nestled little blue lake winding trout brook 
mechanics electrical engineers sent already officially vacation 
entire program could carried without attracting least attention orders great transcontinental lines frequent importance attached 
four days final plans completed last supplies assembled portable metal shed house completed machine 
shining tungsto steel alloy frame members rapidly welded place cathode ray welding torches hands skilled artisans 
already end shop generator arranged use molecular motion power units 
many power units drive support ship finished awaiting installation crew quit work fourth evening 
would installed frame morning generator would hoisted place small portable crane 
storage batteries connected place hull 
great fused quartz windows rested cases along one wall awaiting complete application steel alloy plates 
inch thick unnecessary thickness perhaps need economize weight witnessed choice steel instead light metal alloys throughout construction 
three men arrived late afternoon small helicopter gone directly shops see progress made 
forced remain new york superintend shipment necessary supplies camp site since trouble anticipated making steel framework felt necessary come 
would needed superintend delicate work 
shaping nicely arcot gazed rapidly rounding frame critical eye 
unhindered traditional shapes wings protuberances able design machine striking beauty 
ship retain natural metallic sheen protection coat passivity paint liquid chemical could brushed sprayed iron chromium nickel cobalt alloys rendering passive practically chemical agents 
new paint left iron steel brilliantly glossy ever overcast beautiful iridescence immune powerful reagents 
three men walked around rapidly growing hull looked excited interest heavy welded joints great beams 
ship seemed capable withstanding fall several hundred feet little damage 
location power units plainly visible easily recognized point came together four five great beams welded one great mass tough metal set heavy tungsten bolts would hold units place 
inspected joint minutely signs flaws using small portable x ray fluoroscope see interior metal 
joint seemed perfect 
retired satisfied everything ready work next day 
morning began early long swim lake hearty breakfast country cured ham eggs 
work great framework continued day saw power units bolted place removable change thought advisable 
power unit equipped long streamlined copper fins lying close rounded hull might absorb heat rapidly 
day day structure drew nearer completion large crew highly skilled workers craft practically complete within week 
instruments remained installed 
last even put place aid fuller morey junior father arcot connected many complicated circuits 
son remarked arcot senior looking critically great switchboard maze connections many rheostats controls heavy bus bar connectors behind one man keep eye instruments 
certainly hope good sized crew operate controls spent two days getting circuits together admit still beat 
see intend watch instruments time idea going outside 
oh laughed arcot junior intended constant watching 
merely helps lot tests want make 
want use flying laboratory determine necessary powers lowest factor safety use building machines 
machine nearly completed 
need seats special air inflated gyroscopically controlled seats make impossible sudden twist ship put strain wrong direction 
course main gyroscopes balance ship laterally horizontally vertically chair separate gyroscopic mounting safety 
expect start pirate fuller asked 
plan practice manipulation machine least four days arcot replied try chase pirate 
ordinarily recommend greatest haste man stolen close ten million already still 
would done anyone right mind 
suppose heard war department considers new gas important obtained pardon condition permitted secret 
demand return money doubt 
firmly convinced kleptomaniac 
doubt greatly stop taking money caught 
therefore safe wait sure ability operate machine smoothly 
course would suicidal 
also tool makers make special type molecular motion machine use machine gun 
bullets steel three inches long thick thumb 
perfectly streamlined except little stabilizer tail guide em 
spin rifle bullet gyroscopic effect hold nose streamlining stabilizer keep course 
expect able zip right many inches armor plate since velocity four miles second 
fed rate two hundred minute faster wish started small spring 
instantly come field powerful molecular motion director shot terrific speed 
first rifle ever made could shoot bullets absolutely parallel ground 
today 
guns mounted outside controlled electrically charts installed tomorrow 
day tomorrow eight plan take work next day rushed completion far earlier arcot dared hope 
men kept isolated farm lest accidentally spread news new machine 
excited interest helped machine completion 
guns mounted yet could wait 
mid afternoon found machine resting great construction shed completely equipped ready fly dick said morey strode testing last gyroscopic seats ready certainly want get going three thirty go around sunlight part world gets dark speeds travel 
let test anxious start bob 
sent us air inspector 
soon comes start 
put x license indication 
go us test hope 
room three people aboard think dad logical passengers 
pointed excitedly 
look government helicopter coming 
tell men get blocks tow 
two power trucks 
get least ten feet beyond end hangar 
start straight climb least five mile height make mistakes safely 
tending see induce air inspector take trip us 
half hour later machine rolled entirely shed new concrete runway 
great craft thing beauty shimmering bright sunlight four men ride maiden voyage stood one side gazing great gleaming metal hull 
long sweeping lines sides told story perfect streamlining implied high speed even rest 
bright slightly iridescent steel hull shone silvery contrast gleaming copper power units heat absorption fins 
great clear windows nose low streamlined air intake generator seemed accentuate graceful lines machine 
lord beauty dick exclaimed morey broad smile pleasure face 
well shape nicely paper 
oh fuller congratulations masterpiece 
even better looking thought copper added color 
look fast wish need physicists badly trip could go first ride us 
oh right dick know number instruments realize mean lot work trip 
wish luck 
honor designed first ship like first heavier air ship ever flew without wings jets props something remember 
think one beautiful ever flew 
well dick said father quietly let get way 
fly really know four men entered ship strapped gyroscopic seats 
one one reported ready 
captain mason arcot explained air inspector seats may seem bit active one generally expects seat experimental machine provided safety devices could think 
ship fall sure power great might well prove fatal us position resist forces 
know well effect sharp turns high speed results centrifugal force 
machine develop tremendous power make provision 
notice controls instruments mounted arm chair really permits maintain complete control ship times still permits chair remain perpendicular forces 
gyroscopes base cause entire chair remain stable ship rolls chair continue revolve bearing forced seats 
confident find machine safe enough license 
shall start right dr arcot replied air inspector 
father willing try 
ready engineer asked arcot 
ready pilot replied morey 
right keep eye meters dad turn system 
instruments back take care everything see one flash red mark yank open main circuit 
call watch turn 
ready son 
main gyroscopes low snap clicking relays rear compartment low hum quickly ran scale 
main generators clicking switch relays thudding action rising hum 
seat gyroscopes 
low click succeeded quick shrilling sound rose moments range hearing separate seat gyroscopes took work 
main power tube bank low hum generator changed momentary roar relays threw full load 
moment automatic controls brought speed 
everything working perfectly far 
ready start son main vertical power units great ship trembled throughout length lift power units started 
special instrument set floor beside arcot might able judge lift power units registered apparent weight ship 
read two hundred tons 
eyes fixed pointer dropped quickly click instrument flopped back registering pounds needle moved zero mighty structure floated air slowly moving field breeze carried along ground 
men outside saw rise swiftly sky straight toward blue vault heaven 
two three minutes disappearing 
glistening ship shrank tiny point light gone must rising fully three hundred miles hour men car tremendous increase weight forced air cushions like leaden masses 
ground fell away speed made look amazement 
house construction shed lake seemed contracting beneath 
quickly rising time adjust mental attitude 
world seemed shrinking 
tremendous height twenty miles risen atmosphere air thin sky seemed black stars blazed cold unwinking glory great fires sun seemed reaching space like mighty arms seeking draw back parent body masses wheeling planets 
far flung streamers cold fire shone mighty zodiacal light aurora titanic scale 
moment hung made readings meters 
arcot first speak awe voice 
never began let power thing ship made commercially use one horsepower generators people kill trying see fast go 
methodically machine tried height testing various settings instruments 
definitely proven values arcot morey assigned purely theoretical calculations correct within one tenth one percent 
power absorbed machine knew calculated terrific power driving units far beyond expectations 
well horizontal maneuvers arcot announced 
sure agree machine climb hold air 
air pressure controls seem working perfectly 
test speed 
suddenly seats swung beneath ship shot forward ever greater speed ever greater acceleration seemed turned headed upward although knew main stabilizing gyroscopes holding level 
moment ship headed atlantic speed rifle bullet ever known 
radio speedometer needle pushed farther farther speed increased unheard values 
left north american shoreline traveling faster mile second 
middle atlantic arcot gradually shut acceleration letting seats drop back position 
hubbub excited comments rose four men 
momentarily full realization historical importance flight one paid attention anyone else 
finally question air inspector reached arcot ears 
speed attain dr arcot look coast europe fast going traveling rate three miles second peak 
arcot answered 
fallen two half 
arcot turned attention controls 
going try see ultimate ceiling machine 
must ceiling since depends operation generator operate power units 
turn depends heat air helped somewhat sun rays 
go ship put vertical climb steadily great machine rose 
soon however generator began slow 
readings instruments dropping rapidly 
temperature exceedingly tenuous air outside close absolute zero provided little energy 
get forward speed morey suggested aid air scoop force air faster 
right morey 
arcot slowly applied power forward propulsion units 
took hold ship began move forward 
increase power apparent 
machine started rising 
last height fifty one miles ceiling reached 
cold cabin became unbearable every kilowatt power generator could get air outside needed run power units 
air became foul heavy pumps could replace fresh supply near vacuum outside 
oxygen tanks carried trip 
power generator used warm cabin began fall 
though machine held stable gyroscopes dropping freely fifty miles fall resistance denser air mounted could begin feel sense weight return 
passed maneuvers dr arcot air inspector decidedly impressed 
required altitude passed long ago still miles guess fast falling tell unless point nose ship apparatus works direction ship pointed 
hold everyone going start using power stop us 
night returned little field vermont 
established new record every form aeronautical achievement except endurance altitude record speed record speed climb acceleration record arcot could think passed 
ship coming dock night 
morning would 
arcot sufficiently expert controls maneuver ship safely ground 
finally solved wind difficulty decreasing weight ship fifty pounds thus enabling three men carry hanger next two days devoted careful tests power factors machine best operating frequency efficient altitude operation many tests time 
three younger men took turns operating great strains sudden acceleration arcot senior decided would wisest stay ground watch 
meantime reports pirate became fewer fewer less less money shipped air 
arcot spent four days practicing manipulation machine though handled far readily craft ever controlled always danger turning much power stress sudden excitement 
night arcot sailed ship alighted roof morey senior apartment leaving enough power reduce weight ten tons lest fall roof went see president lines bait pirate 
send cash along said arcot saw morey senior say quarter million 
make less public knowledge talk pirate may think real haul board 
going accompany plane height quarter mile 
try locate means radar apparatus naturally locate 
hope scared away rather believe rate lose try iv morey arcot looking great jersey aerodrome fields broad marshes centuries 
filled stretched miles great landing field close great city across river 
men car watching field hanging inert point glistening metal high deep velvet purple sky fifteen miles air separated transcontinental machine 
saw field glasses great plane lumbering slowly across field gaining momentum headed westward breeze 
seemed barely clearing great skyscrapers towered twenty four hundred feet air arching four five city blocks 
height toys made colored paper soft colors glistening hot noon sunlight around wove lines flashing moving helicopters individual lost mass million swiftly moving machines 
higher steadily moving levels traffic visible 
look traffic thousands thousands coming back city going home lunch every day number helicopters increasing invention machine conditions would soon impossible 
airblast cities unbearable getting worse time 
many machines get enough power hold middle levels current one hundred miles hour foot level downtown new york 
takes racer climb fast gyroscopic stabilizers could never live huge airpocket 
drive 
always afraid somebody old worn bus stabilizer failure really smash things 
morey skillful pilot realized others dangers downward airblast countless whirring blades maintained constant roar air 
office buildings double walls thick layers sound absorbing materials stop roar cyclonic blast continued almost unabated twelve hours day 
oh know morey replied arcot 
thing drawbacks 
remember ten million machines hung air new york city would noticeable drop temperature 
probably arctic climate year year 
know though unbearably hot gets city noon even coldest winter days due heating effect air friction thousands blades 
known temperature air go fifty degrees 
probably sort balance two types machines 
terrific economic problem time solve difficulties great companies fermenting grain residues alcohol 
castor bean growers also going bring prices lot machine kills market 
also anxious extract carbon cornstalks reducing ores iron metals 
ship flew high transcontinental plane men discussed economic values different applications arcot discoveries huge power stations could make cooling ventilating houses 
dick mentioned cooling effect new york city millions millions machines huge power plants thousand different applications use terrific drain energy air cause whole world become little cooler asked fuller 
doubt bob said arcot slowly 
thought 
remember energy use eventually ends heat anyway 
remember decillions ergs energy sun giving true get infinitesimal portion energy get enough us 
power houses established conveniently tropics cool air energy used refine metals 
means surplus heat tropics find use 
weather control also possible direction control great winds 
could set huge director tubes tops mountains blow winds whatever direction best suited us 
blown wind vast volume air carried would able cool temperate zones summer cold poles warm winter heat tropics 
thoughtful silence arcot continued another thing may make possible future thing may hard accept commercial proposition 
practically inexhaustible source energy sources minerals last indefinitely 
copper becoming rare 
discoveries great copper fields sahara alaska 
platinum exhausted even iron becoming valuable 
facing shortage metals 
realize within next two centuries unable maintain civilization unless get new sources certain basic raw materials one chance 
solution nine planets solar system neptune uranus far vaster earth utterly impossible life know small colony might established refine metals distant earth 
might able build domed sealed cities 
first could try nearer planets mars venus satellites moon 
certainly hope machine make possible 
time sat silence sped along high green plains indiana 
chicago lay like tremendous jewel far horizon right ahead 
five miles huge bulk transcontinental plane seemed toy swung slowly across fields actually traveling six hundred miles hour 
last morey spoke 
right arcot 
think interplanetary aspects day 
oh chicago better start vacuum gas protector 
radar 
may soon see action 
three men immediately forgot somewhat distant danger metal shortage 
number adjustments made quickly completed machine forged evenly steadily ahead 
generator adjusted maximum efficiency various tubes tested separately though new good twenty five thousand hours would inconvenient say least one failed action 
tested perfect knew smooth functioning various relays governed generator loads varied must working perfectly something less one half maximum rating 
steadily flew waiting tensely first sign glow tiny neon tube indicator panel morey 
looks familiar dick said morey looking fields low line blue mountains far western horizon 
think took little nap flying wheel chair papers called 
would th look get ready action fuller 
taking machine gun work invisibility disrupter arcot run ship 
let go board tiny neon tube flickered dully glowed briefly like piece red hot iron went 
moment glowing quickly brilliance mounted till line crimson 
morey snapped switch general radar beam receiver might locate machine exactly 
fully minute neon tube flashed life 
pirate flying ahead big plane likely gassing 
around air guardsmen unaware enemy near 
disrupter beam could projected mile would dive enemy instant later great plane beneath seemed rushing upward terrific speed 
two radar beams kept focused constantly pirate craft 
two miles two planes neon tube blazed brilliantly clash opposing energy 
pirate trying maintain invisibility rapidly growing strength machine strove batter 
moments ammeter connected disrupter beam began rise rapidly morey watched concern 
despite ten kilowatt set used project beam resistance apparatus board pirate ship amazing 
abruptly three became aware rapidly solidifying cloud 
interference beam morey sending begun breaking molecular oscillation permitted light pass freely pirate craft 
suddenly circle blue light shadow form moment later ionized air relapsed normal condition pirate apparatus broke strain 
morey shut apparatus convinced sudden change pirate apparatus blown 
glanced quickly arcot called morey look go late 
already plane shot terrific speed 
flashed left rate climb seemed unbelievable except long trail flaming gas told story plane propelled rockets terrific acceleration carried range vision instant arcot swung ship bring within sight windows gasped already many miles away 
terrific wrench arcot threw power dared quickly leveled machine following pirate lightning speed 
increased acceleration men grew accustomed force weighed 
ahead pirate racing along quickly overhauling machine wings sort produced tremendous amount head resistance present velocity already needle radio speedometer moved one mile second 
following fleet plane ahead rate miles hour 
roar air outside tremendous wave sound yet protected vacuum double walls detectable vibration car 
rapidly pirate lead cut 
seemed moment would within range machine gun 
suddenly nosed shot ground ten miles power dive 
instantly arcot swung machine loop held close tail pirate 
swift maneuvers speed terrific strain men machines acceleration seemed crushing weight four men arcot followed pirate wide loop right ended straight climb rocket ship standing tail rocket blast roaring behind stream fire half mile long 
pirate climbing speed would distanced machine world ever seen tenacious opponent behind clung ever tighter tiny darting thing 
released great clouds animation suspending gas 
utter surprise ship behind driven right entirely unaffected knew gas unable devise material stop mask tank store yet way men succeeded hurtling bullet shaped machine behind like miniature airship speed acceleration put even ship shame could twist turn dive rise shoot straight away flashing speed anything aloft 
time tried complicated maneuvers strained utmost yet machine always followed one thing 
outer space rockets would support 
straight climb shot blazing sun space sky around grew black stars shone solemn splendor around 
eyes one thing shining car rising equal speed behind 
knew must climbing two thousand miles hour yet tracker came ever closer 
sighting range machine gun moment faltering men machine behind sat white lipped tense whirling shocks sudden turns terrific speed twisted gyroscopic seats around like peas rolling ball 
left right darting machine ahead twisting unbelievable speed 
suddenly nose pointed zenith great column flame shooting behind heading straight toward space gets lose morey said arcot 
terrific acceleration climb seemed press seats deadly weight 
labor talk still car ahead shot slowly seemed overhauling 
velocities perforce lowered effects gravity air resistance atmosphere well nigh gone acceleration human body could stand considered 
man ahead pushing plane ahead acceleration would killed many men slowly acceleration machine falling 
arcot pushed control last ampere felt slight surge greater power rushed coils momentarily 
soon gone generator behind faltered 
driving power atmospheric heat gone 
sixty miles could see earth greenish brown surface slightly convex far east could distinguish silvery line water eyes column shooting flame represented fleeing raider airless space safe 
could follow 
arcot turned plane parallel earth watching plane roof window 
slowly machine sank fifty mile level sufficient air maintain efficient operation 
well beat us one thing us 
must hang rockets till leave hang indefinitely keep cabin decently warm 
air cool sun warm 
thing worrying right heat rockets 
throw gases 
lord machine eventually rockets give come hang beneath whoa fast going stay seems angling ship bit shooting along besides holding making little forward progress 
follow going speeding seems well keep level 
dick plane ever made would stood terrific pulls yanks plane got 
steering twisting standard type air rudders strains unique type plane must extremely strong 
never saw one shaped like though obvious shape huge triangular arrowhead ever see one like something like yes 
recognize development old paper gliders used throw around kid shape triangular wings point lead except undoubtedly slight curve wings increase efficiency 
something like flying wings fifty years ago 
hope man kleptomaniac cured may new laboratory partner 
exceedingly intelligent ideas ingenious man wish store quite much fuel rocket tubes unbearably cold sacrifice power comfort 
rocket ship seems getting acceleration level 
dropping steadily get air run generator 
going fast enough followed beneath pirate faster faster rockets ship began push forward 
dick use rockets first instead gradually increasing power way operating ship morey understand 
look speedometer moment see figure 
hmmm 
miles per second buzzing right along see good lord never get rate expect get idea yet 
missed important point 
going 
miles second 
reaches miles second never come hundred fifty mile high perch establish orbit much centrifugal force already little weight 
staying right beneath much either 
well goes last spurt 
falling behind pretty fast catching holding parallel done look arcot pulled watch let go 
floated motionless air moment slowly drifted back toward rear room 
using bit acceleration bit need maintain speed 
high enough make air resistance almost nothing even velocity still require power 
know low buzz repeated twice 
instantly morey turned dials radio receiving set call signal sounded 
moment voice came low distinct 
power seemed fading rapidly 
wade pirate help 
get outside atmosphere exceed orbital speed fall orbit get 
fuel reserve gage stuck used rockets 
power 
slow fall 
running compressed air generator set going take animation suspending gas able reach entering night quick morey answer 
try pirate think make ok power gone last power failed pirate marooned space seen rockets go leaving exhaust tube glowing moment dark sun shining silvery ship made visible 
hurry want anything reaches night radio san francisco fields coming soon need large electro magnet one designed work volts dc good sized storage cells many decided later depending room 
start decelerating make turn circle back 
somewhere west hawaii believe ought able trick use power 
morey set work radio set raise san francisco airport 
soon communication told would hour 
promised necessary materials also would get ready receive pirate finally brought 
nearer hour quarter later machine fell great san francisco landing field mechanics set work bolting huge electro magnet landing skids bottom machine 
serious problem connecting terminals electrically without making holes hull ship 
finally one terminal grounded radio aerial used 
fuller left behind trip large number cells installed every possible position 
power room hastily arranged motor generator set arranged making possible run entire ship batteries 
scarcely battened prevent sliding accelerations necessary arcot morey 
entire operation required fifteen minutes 
going catch arcot overtake going west 
went way meet going miles second relation machine 
right idea 
told fall greater orbital speed 
go within earth atmosphere till get holding air means downward acceleration part regular lifting power units 
going try reach eight miles second 
overhauling three second ship slow right speed falling 
must reach gets shadow earth though reaches night without heat die cold 
think reach dick hope 
spare cells right need function get fall clear space eight miles second would leave earth forever ship accelerating steadily highest value men aboard could stand 
needle speedometer crept steadily across dial 
flying height forty miles might enough air still greatly hindered air resistance 
black sky spotted points glowing light blazing stars space 
flew along sensation weight lost reached orbital speed car steadily increased velocity came strange sensation earth loomed gigantic shone sun direction changed terrific speed needle speedometer wavering 
miles second 
held steady thought going take eight miles second dick air resistance great go higher height fifty miles continued 
miles second 
seemed hours reached spot pirate machine flying directly searched black sky sign shining dot light 
aid field glasses found far ahead nearly one hundred miles 
well go going fall hundred miles till right path work done gravity slow us little use power units somewhat 
notice yes painted dull black 
idea air get heat power depend sunlight absorb 
using slow us much possible 
last tiny silver dot grown till became recognizable pirate plane 
drawing slowly steadily 
last little machine directly beneath scant hundred yards away 
long since forced run machine storage batteries applied little power vertical power units 
sluggishly absorbed sun heat machine forced lower nearer machine 
last scant ten feet separated 
right morey 
snap temporary switch closed current surged big magnet keel 
felt ship jump little impulse magnet pull smaller machine 
moment little plane drifted idle magnet touched bounce morey snapped switch shut two machines locked firmly together got dick morey exclaimed 
slow till falls 
go wait 
glider ought quite manageable energy power units roof machine began slow two machines magnet grinding slightly momentum plane thrust upon 
watched speedometer drop 
speed sinking slowly area absorbing fins designed absorb sun heat directly inefficient 
sun indeed sinking horizon beginning watch curious phenomenon seeing dawn backward first struck air dense enough operate power units noticeably 
quickly power applied till machines sank rapidly warmer levels governing factor tendency glider break loose grip magnet 
fifty miles generator started heaters car became active 
heat car unavoidable 
would try bring warm levels quickly 
whew glad reached air dick 
tell sooner done good battery gone something like twenty amp hours left giving recharge generator take 
seem plenty power 
knew cells low idea low noticed magnet weakening thought due added air strain 
going put thing nose dive let glider go 
know would land correctly chance 
going follow course since middle siberia better start back 
return trip necessarily lower level atmosphere glider might kept reasonably warm 
height two miles turbulent atmosphere glider brought slowly home 
took nearly twenty hours go short distance twelve thousand miles san francisco two men taking turns controls 
air resistance glider forced go slowly could average much better six hundred hour despite fact speed either machine alone twelve hundred miles hour 
last great skyscrapers san francisco appeared horizon thousands private planes started meet 
frantically arcot warned away lest air blast props tear glider magnet 
last however air guard able force safe distance clear lane one lower levels city traffic 
great field transcontinental lines packed excited men women waiting catch glimpse two greatest things country heard century arcot molecular motion machine air pirate landing made safely circle air guardsmen 
small hospital plane standing beside moment arcot ship released hung motionless soundless people watched wonder excitement 
wanted see arcot perform clamored see wonderful powers ship operation 
air guardsmen witnessed flying game tag two super air machines told press radio 
two weeks later arcot stepped office mr morey senior 
busy come know busy busy 
mind wade pirate 
oh hmm 
saw reports lab rockies also psychomedical reports 
particularly saw request employment sent channels 
opinion talked 
arcot frowned slightly 
talked still two different identities dancing around one body 
dr ridgely says problem settling believe 
ridgely fool line dad lines ridgely business healing mental wounds 
agreed back pirate must insane even met 
also agreed tremendously competent creative mind 
personality civilization evidently slipped several cogs 
ridgely says reparable 
know newton beam two years 
faraday complete breakdown nearly five years breakdown came back monumental work 
men help modern psychomedical techniques 
think grade fools pass chance get wade help 
man insane figured way stabilizing storing atomic hydrogen rockets 
could shape say smart keep competition family 
mr morey leaned back chair smiled arcot 
got good case 
buy 
dr ridgely says wade got slipped cogs replaced offer job lab staff 
bit older grown world psychomedical techniques really work 
growing psychomedical techniques strictly rule thumb doctors thumbs 
mr morey sighed 
matter think judgment better mine 
see offer job 
pretty sure take said 
suspicion within six months lot saner people around 
ordinary man realize job rechecking present techniques wade naturally getting thorough overhaul 
somewhat like man going treatment broken arm decent hospital also check medical problems come healthier never broken arm 
wade seems mind made friends molecules talked language 
ridgely shows make friends people think quite man team book two solarite lights great transcontinental airport blazing cheering splendor 
center broad field dozen men silhouetted white brilliance looking sky stars winked cold clear jet background frosty night 
slim crescent moon gleamed west sickle light way dimmed cold flame brilliant stars 
one point light moved across motionless field far suns flashing toward airport long swift curve 
men field murmured pointed swept low blazing lights new york 
lower swooped towering city behind 
half mile air buildings rose shining glory colored tile shone brightly sweeping play floodlights 
one picked descending machine suddenly leaped darkness shining streamlined cylinder cylinder great halo blue fire beam searchlight set jet black night 
moments ship vast eyes waiting men landed gently field floating smoothly gracefully toward 
twenty four men climbed great ship shivering icy blast swept across field spoke moment group awaiting arrival climbed quickly grateful warmth field car 
moment speeding toward lights field house half mile 
behind huge ship leaped sky suddenly pointed nose angle thirty degrees shot high air unbelievable speed 
instant gone 
field house party broke almost immediately 
want thank mr morey demonstration new ship tonight dr arcot answering many questions 
sure appreciate kindness shown press 
reporters filed quickly anxious get news morning editions one clock 
received small slip paper attendant standing exit official statement company 
last left six men responsible new machine 
night witnessed official demonstration first arcot morey molecular motion ships 
small compared come yet could carry three thousand passengers many could existing winged plane speed immensely greater 
trip west coast eastern made less one hour 
speed close one mile second great ship shot thin air twenty five miles earth 
vessel huge bar metal could affected ultra high frequency generator 
affected molecules moved forward taking ship 
thus molecular motion drive vessel could theoretically approach velocity light limit 
arcot said morey senior pressmen left room president company certainly want thank tremendous thing given us use 
sold us machine repay time time sold us inventions ideas made possible transcontinental attain present high position world transportation 
ever accepted laboratory use upkeep small annual income 
show appreciation time answered arcot smiling stated terms correctly 
actually fully equipped lab putter around time want amusement money want 
could ask suppose true draw six thousand year personal expenses good clerk could get admittedly brilliant physicist earth satisfied feel paying properly arcot expression became suddenly serious 
repay time said latest discovery made new thing possible 
always wanted able visit planets many scientist last three centuries 
machine made possible 
willing could start spring 
quite serious 
permission want start work first interplanetary ship 
need fuller help course 
proposition expensive must ask help 
think however may paying proposition certainly something commercial value planets 
walked shed arcot private molecular motion car stood first machine ever built used heat sun drive 
thoughtfully president great transcontinental lines looked 
small compared great machine brought east swift type 
thing graceful beauty even ground long curving streamlines giving wonderful symmetry 
stood thoughtful silence minute young men eager hear verdict prospective backer 
morey always rather slow speech took unusually long time answer 
money asked arcot gladly give double sum case 
know perfectly well go son go fuller wade naturally go 
looked turn 
come mean lot 
fuller known bob since college days 
known wade three months every day grow like 
denying fact trip terrifically dangerous proposition 
lost would personal loss 
would lose brilliant men earth 
instance conceded world brilliant physicist fuller one greatest designing engineers wade rapidly rising prominence chemist physicist son certainly good mathematician 
paused frowning weighing situation 
men know get scrapes much better 
certainly men earth would willing back group men one matter back trip words became facetious 
know arcot bob handle gun fairly well know much wade fuller 
experience two fuller shook head 
think fit best galley trip mr morey 
done cooking number camping trips food important factor success expedition 
shoot bit 
wade spoke rather hesitantly 
come west good bit fun gun rockies still mountain lions deer know 
also sneaking acquaintance new gun arcot developed connection molecular motion 
little know bad see really get opportunity added hastily certainly intend keep old boy knocking since invited arcot smiled 
definitely support us yes replied morey senior seriously think worth 
four young men climbed ship start apartment 
arcot piloting sure touch ship sped cold night air atmosphere till hung poised height fifty miles upper edge airy blanket 
looked silent thought magnificent blazing stars space 
dust laden air could longer mask true colors stars shone unwinkingly steadily glory earth bound men never seen 
shone wonderous riot color varied beautiful display colored floodlights great city 
tiny pinpoints radiance red green orange yellow shining intense brilliance 
slowly arcot let machine settle blazing city miles 
love come look cold pinpoint lights seem draw lure worlds 
always sense unfulfilled longing desire go always hopeless 
next spring arcot paused looked mighty field stars arched head lost either horizon 
wonderful night shall go first dick asked wade softly gazed far suns space voice unconsciously hushed grandeur spectacle 
thought last four months definitely going go make decision 
actually hard decide 
course leave solar system 
outer planets far away think better wait till later trips 
leaves choice really mars venus mercury 
mercury practical since close sun 
know fair bit mars telescopic observation venus wrapped perpetual cloud mystery 
vote well said morey seems fun explore completely unknown planet one observed telescopically 
vote venus 
others agreed morey venus logical choice 
time machine sunk roof apartment men disembarked entered 
next day start actual work designing space ship 
ii start work arcot began next morning obviously want design ship conditions expect meet maximum convenience safety 
believe thought trip longer rest present ideas first 
actually know anything conditions venus since one actually 
venus probably younger planet earth 
far nearer sun gets twice heat 
long gone time planets cooling believe venus required far longer earth inpouring heat would retard cooling 
surface temperature probably degrees fahrenheit 
little land probably cloud mass covering venus logical visualize tremendous seas 
life developed must largely aquatic land probably far behind us evolution 
course venus planet mystery know guess 
know things going need cross space 
obviously main driving force power units 
get energy rays sun absorbing copper discs twelve feet diameter ship disc cylinder 
think ship hundred eighty feet long fifty feet wide twenty feet deep best dimensions 
power units strung along top ship double rows one side hull 
middle series fused quartz windows opening large room outer shell 
obviously need source power activate power tubes run molecular motion power units 
generator run molecular motion power units absorbing heat atmosphere room 
air heated rays sun course way get power sun 
since absorption energy might result making ship cool due radiation side away sun polish thus reduce unlighted side radiation 
power units able steer us space due position sides steer us atmosphere usual method unable get sun power shaded 
steering space use atomic hydrogen rockets storing atomic gas wade method tanks hold 
also battery starting generator emergencies 
protection meteors use radar 
anything comes within dozen miles us radar unit covering sector set automatic machinery operation rockets shoot ship path meteor 
day arcot others discussed various pieces apparatus would need toward evening fuller began draw rough sketches different mechanisms agreed upon 
next day late afternoon planned rough details ship begun greater task calculating stresses power factors 
need tremendous strength ship space arcot commented little strain 
weightless start gentle acceleration strain least must strength maneuver atmosphere 
leave earth centrifugal force make much better speed atmosphere plenty power draw outside must depend solely sunlight 
circle earth forming orbit within atmosphere five miles second 
gradually increase speed ten miles second point ship would normally fly space centrifugal force 
power units prevent release proper moment 
release entirely free earth work needed overcome earth pull 
planning continued exasperating slowness 
details work complex machines totally new 
several weeks passed even power units could ordered first work ship started 
orders materials left office daily 
still late november last order sent 
must begin work phases expedition food supplies standard parts equipment 
interval arcot decided make special ventilated suit use venus 
make use small molecular motion director apparatus cool air blow suit 
apparatus consisted small compressed air driven generator power tube bank could carried back 
arcot wade said saw apparatus completed testing machine ready noticed similar portable invisibility apparatus developed pirate 
wonder might handy times invisible could incorporate slight change 
add five pounds tubes using sure easily strong enough carry extra load 
great idea wade said arcot 
might useful met hostile natives 
disappearance stunt might make us gods something primitive beings 
mention think install apparatus ship 
require almost power might save lives time 
work went forward steadily great transcontinental shops space ship built 
construction kept much secret possible arcot feared interference crowds would sure collect facts known since shops directly joined airfield meant would helicopters buzzing transatlantic transcontinental planes 
work done required careful manipulation workmanship one defect could mean death 
calculated six weeks trip time could reach either planet much might happen crippled ship 
men making trip waiting seemed exasperating spent days could begin installation electrical apparatus purchasing necessary standard equipment standard coils tubes condensers canned food supplies clothes everything could imagine possible utility 
making ship great deal empty storage space arcot hoped trip would financial success particularly supplying much needed metals 
many vital elements already excessively scarce satisfactory substitutes found 
outward trip space would filled many things would consume en route 
addition carrying great many spare parts spare tubes spare power units spare condensers thousand one odd parts 
arcot intended able make entire new power switchboard motion director unit anything go wrong certainly apparatus 
last came day final connection soldered last joint welded 
atomic hydrogen tanks full ship power oxygen tanks filled batteries charged 
ready test flight great ship rested floor shed awaiting start 
oh fellows come minute arcot called members party 
want show something 
three walked quickly bow arcot stood following line vision looked wonder see everything right 
watched curiously drew coat large glass bottle tightly sealed 
asked wade curiously 
start first cruise wondering time gave ship name 
great thinking going name well said arcot thinking alexander longed worlds conquer bad morey commented 
thinking naming guess thinking santa maria first ship discover new world 
thinking home said wade 
calling terrestrian well turn fuller designed 
suggest masterpiece asked arcot 
thinking also home home never leave 
like think might find people venus would like name might translatable friendly less foreign terms call solarite solarite member solar system always 
world unto makes trips take orbit sun true member solar system 
like arcot turned others 
agreed upon unanimously

ten minutes conversing friends apparently none worse except severe headache 
doctor gave mild opiate sent bed sleep effects blow 
ship fully equipped tested checked every possible way time leaving set following saturday three days 
great supplies stores carried aboard meantime 
care exercised work lest cargo slip free varying acceleration solarite batter bits even wreck vital part ship 
noon day chosen first ship ever leave bounds earth gravity ready start gently heavily laden solarite rose hangar floor slowly floated bright sunshine early february day 
beside rode little ship arcot first built piloted father inventor 
rode elder morey dozen newsmen 
little ship badly crowded rose slowly high upper reaches earth atmosphere 
sky growing dark going space last reached absolute ceiling smaller ship hung solarite went miles higher slowly ever faster faster plunging ahead gathering speed 
watched radio speedometer creep steadily rose acceleration pressed hard back seats still rose hum generator became low snarl rocketing twelve miles second tenuous air ship shrieking thin scream protest parted streamlined bow 
slowly speed rose reached fifteen miles second 
sun pull became steadily powerful falling toward fiery sphere away earth 
microphone recessed outer wall brought fading whisper air outside 
arcot shouted sudden warning hold going lose weight space click angry snarl overworked generator died instant thudding relays cut circuit 
simultaneously air scoop carried air generator switched transferring solar heat source power 
seemed falling terrific ever increasing speed 
looked saw earth shrinking visibly shot away five miles second traveling fifteen miles second ahead five second straight 
men watched intensest interest heavens opened could see stars scant degree sun air diffused blinding glory 
heat rays seemed burn prickling pleasantness looked mighty sea flame smoked glasses 
vast arms corona reached like tentacles fiery octopus thousands miles space huge arms flaming gas writhed though reach drag back whirling planets parent body 
mighty sphere stretching far space wan glow seemed ebb flow kaleidoscope swiftly changing color 
zodiacal light aurora borealis scale inconceivable arcot worked rapidly controls absence weight gave continued sense unending fall aiding assistants rapid setting controls 
last work done ship flashed way control instruments would guide across millions miles space land venus unerring certainty 
photo electric telescopic eye watched planet constantly keeping ship surely accurately course would get distant planet shortest possible time 
work thereafter became routine requiring minimum effort men could rest use time observe beauties skies man ever seen billions years time solar system existed 
lack atmosphere made possible use power magnification terrestrial telescope may use 
blurred outlines produced shifting air prohibits magnifications hundred diameters space could use greatest power telescope 
could look mars see clearly man ever seen despite fact two hundred million miles away 
though spent much time taking photographs planets moon making spectrum analyses sun time passed slowly 
day day saw measured clocks stayed awake finding needed little sleep wasted physical energy 
weightlessness eliminated fatigue 
however determined twelve hours reaching venus must thoroughly alert tried sleep pairs 
arcot morey first seek slumber morpheus seemed mundane god reward 
last became necessary take mild opiate muscles refused permit tired brains sleep 
twelve hours later awoke relieve wade fuller 
spent twelve hours routine watch playing games chess 
little done 
silver globe seemed unchanging still far away seemed little larger moon seen earth 
last time effects mild drug wear wade fuller awaken sleep 
morey idea expression perfect innocence arcot face twinkle humor eyes

wonder would said morey grasping arcot idea 
say try arcot turned little switch ship gone fuller stirred uneasily bed tightly strapped 
effects drug wearing 
sleepily yawned stretched blindly heavy eyes still closed released straps held bed 
yawning widely opened eyes sudden start sat upright excellent imitation indian warpath leaped bed started run wildly across floor 
eyes raised place ceiling called lustily alarm suddenly flying crashed heavily invisible ceiling face picture utter astonishment fell lightly floor slowly changed took chagrined smile understood spun around loud cries suddenly resounded wade room across hall dull thud forgetting weightlessness jumped hit ceiling 
cries gone like snuffing candle 
control room rose loud laughter moment later felt normal saw four strong walls 
wade sighed heavily shook head 
approaching planet visibly 
twelve hours passed covered million miles falling toward planet attraction 
glowed wonderous splendor mighty disc molten silver 
last twenty four hours reducing speed relative venus insure forming orbit planet rather shoot around back space 
velocity hundred miles second part way reduced ten 
gravity planet urging forward ever increasing speed problem became acute moment moment 
never make power units alone space said arcot seriously 
shoot around planet 
tell though 
circle around entering atmosphere daylight side shoot upper limits atmosphere 
power units find heat work really slow 
use rocket tubes get acceleration need drive ship air 
sudden clanging bell everyone dived hold held tightly 
instant later terrific wrench rocket jets threw plane way meteor 
getting near planet 
third meteor met since million miles earth 
venus earth planets act like giant vacuum cleaners space pulling space debris meteors within millions miles gravitational attraction 
swiftly planet expanded growing vaster passing moment 
changed disc globe molten silver surface seemed swiftly clouding turned gray saw true appearance vast field rolling billowing clouds solarite shooting around planet ten miles second far enough carry away planet space speed checked 
hold everybody arcot called 
going turn toward planet depressed small lever sudden shock space seemed burst huge deep red atomic hydrogen flames 
solarite reeled sudden pressure heavy gyroscopic stabilizers caught held ship remained even keel 
suddenly came ears men long drawn whine faint almost inaudible ship began slowing 
solarite entered atmosphere venus first man made machine thus penetrate air another world quickly arcot snapped open control kept rockets flaming turning ship planet driving atmosphere

arcot nodded 
drop clouds probably miles deep 
look already changing snow moment water clear away actually see venus ten miles endless distance seemed dropped clouds utterly impenetrable eye 
gradually clouds thinned appeared brief clear spots spots could see short distances caught glimpses green 
water land suddenness startled clouds shooting smoothly swiftly broad plain

venus made morey cried jubilantly 
first men ever leave earth going start old sender radio back home man look stretch plain jumped feet started across control room 
lord feel like ton lead sure condition walking time floating arcot raised restraining hand 
whoa wait minute morey get anything 
earth side venus night side remember day side 
twelve hours able send message 
meantime take controls make test air relieved controls arcot rose walked corridor power room chemical laboratory set 
wade already collected dozen samples air working 
tested far asked arcot 
oxygen co 
oxygen twenty two per cent considering slightly lower air pressure right amount oxygen 
co one tenth one per cent 
atmosphere ok terrestrial life apparently mouse living quite happily 
whatever seventy five per cent diluting gas know nitrogen 
briefly arcot wade discussed unusual atmosphere finally deciding inert gas argon 
great amount nitrogen arcot concluded 
means life sweet time extracting air wherever life finds way impossible 
test accurately try nitrogen try component inert gasses 
ran analyses rapidly short time less hour results stood per cent oxygen 
per cent carbon dioxide per cent argon per cent nitrogen per cent helium per cent neon 
per cent hydrogen rest krypton xenon apparently 
analyses inert gasses done rather roughly short time sufficient balance fairly accurately

microphone turned way 
let step power bit see sounds outside said arcot walked power control switch 
instant later low hum came loudspeaker 
light breeze blowing 
distance forming dull background hum came low rumbling seemed punctuated greater sound 
must long way said arcot puzzled frown face 
swing ship around see direction sound loudest suggested 
slowly morey swung ship around vertical axis 
without doubt something direction hills making considerable noise 
arcot fight two animals two giant animals said might care get near fuller narrowed eyes strove penetrate haze screened low hills blue distance

take arcot always think two steps ahead quicker know machine better anyway 
quickly two men exchanged places 
know morey said voice vacancy arcot thrown ship invisibility 
longer mistakes see made calculations 
see put badly estimate intelligence life found sun gives double dose heat also double dose radiations evidently speed evolution 
anyway may able find friends quickly aid one side lively battle going 
go decision think fine idea said fuller 
side aid sides even seen yet 
let go nearer take good look 
yes going join either side looking oh unanimous said wade excitedly 
invisible ship darted forward 
sped past barrier low hills high broad plain 
startled gasp arcot cut speed 
floating high air magnificent city machine man ever seen titanic airplane monstrous gargantuan every word denoted immensity 
fully three quarters mile huge metal wings stretched dull light cloudy venerian day machine seemed dwarf even vast city beneath 
roar mighty propellers rumbling thunder men solarite 
came flashing bursts flame 
closer inspection watchers saw seemed swarm tiny gnats flying mighty plane 
appeared attacking giant vainly gnats might attack eagle could damage giant machine 
flashing bombs burst blasts yellow flame harmlessly many firecrackers 
mighty plane covered heavy metal plates fully ten inches thick metal tough powerful bombs hit made impression though blasted tremendous craters soil 
poured steady stream bombs burst great flash heat light instant tiny planes struck streaked incandescent masses metal 
yet giant seemed unable approach city defending city vainly courageous little ships poured 
certainly ships kept titanic battleship air bay tensely men watched uneven conflict 
rain bombs continued though fell short city 
slowly around metropolis appeared area flaring molten lava steadily moved toward beautiful buildings 
suddenly battleship turned toward city made short dash inward circling path 
though awaiting maneuver battery hissing flaming swords white light flashed upward hundred feet ring molten rock 
titanic plane rolled side slipped way passed harmlessly barely missing monstrous wing 
arcot demanded 
say city 
one destroy anything magnificent 
dissenting voice raised arcot sent solarite nearer 
world huge thing fuller voice came eerily emptiness 
perfect invulnerability size alone 
sudden silence among terrestrials one tiny planes darted forward dove full speed directly toward one giant propellers 
fifty strung along great wing 
enough could destroyed plane must crash 
came terrific crash flare light splintered fragments flaming wreckage plummeted 
yet mighty blades continued whirling smoothly ever could solarite giant monoplane evidently arcot plan 
touch machine darted high sky great plane 
full mile released sustaining force solarite let drop straight toward source battle falling freely ever rapidly 
rushing mighty plane pace made hearts seem pause suddenly arcot cried hold stop seemed scant hundred feet broad metal wings unsuspecting plane suddenly tremendous jerk man felt pressed floor beneath terrific weight made backs crack load 
doggedly fought retain senses blackness receded 
saw mighty sea roaring red flames hell blazing gas roared like score bombs set 
solarite sitting rocket jets six rocket tubes base ship opened wide streaming furious blast incandescent gas atomic hydrogen shot mighty column gas degrees centigrade 
gas touched great plane flared incandescence immeasurable interval fall solarite ended rebounded high air 
arcot struggling weight six gravities pulled shut little control sent mighty torches blasting 
instant later sped away lest plane shoot toward gas columns 
safe distance looked back work 
longer mighty plane unscathed invulnerable top gaped six great craters incandescent metal almost touched coalesced 
great plane reeled staggering plunging downward long reached hard soil brought level flight despite many dead engines circled fled toward south 
horde small planes followed dropping rain bombs glowing pits ship releasing fury interior 
moments beings manning marauder large extent recovered shock attack fighting back 
moment ship passed horizon sight terrestrians saw great props idle suddenly leap motion instant giant left attackers behind fleeing invisible foe 
arcot guidance ship earth still invisible returned approximate spot destroyed invulnerability giant 
suddenly nothing solarite appeared 
instant dozen tiny two man planes darted toward 
might recognize arcot shot bit higher aid keel rockets one third power 
typical reddish flame atomic hydrogen knew would instantaneously recognizable 
little planes shaped like darts swifter plane earth 
shot along miles hour readily arcot soon found 
minute formed long line circled solarite minimum speed started direction city 
impulse arcot followed instantly planes increased velocity swiftly reaching miles per hour 
city approaching inspiring sight 
mighty towers swept graceful lines half mile air brightly colored walls gleaming rainbow hues giving entire city aspect gigantic jewel single architectural unit 
symmetry order every unit city built around gigantic central edifice rose tremendous tower black gold full half mile air 
outer parts city evidently residential districts low buildings wide streets little green lawns showing care individual owner 
came apartment houses small stores rose gentle slopes higher higher merging last mighty central pinnacle beauty 
city designed whole multitude individually beautiful inharmonious units like wild mixture melodies beautiful mutually discordant 
v terrestrians followed escort high great buildings heading toward great central tower 
moment perfect order ships venerians shot land smoothly high speed 
roof building slowed startling rapidity held back electromagnets top dressing roof landing arcot learned later 
land thing weighs much probably sink right street looks wide enough us land 
arcot maneuvered solarite edge roof dropped swiftly half mile ground 
street leveled descended slowly giving hurrying crowds plenty time get beneath 
landing finally looked curiously mass venerians gathered busy street coming buildings evidently sought shelter raid 
crowd grew rapidly terrestrians watched people new world 
exclaimed fuller startled surprise look almost like us laughed arcot 
particular reason look like us venus earth nearly size planets parent sun 
physical conditions appear similar conditions back home anything svend arrehenius theory life spores sent world world sunlight reason humanoid races found throughout universe 
worlds suitable development life forms 
look size em fuller commented 
size certainly worth noting crowd obviously young less six feet tall 
average seemed seven feet well built men women unusually large chests would seemed human indeed ghastly death like blue tinge skin 
even lips bright blue man lips red 
teeth seemed white human mouths blue 
look eating blueberries laughed wade 
wonder makes blood blue heard blue blooded families first ever seen think answer said morey slowly 
seems odd us people evidently blood based hemocyanin 
us oxygen carried tissues carbon dioxide carried away iron compound hemoglobin many animals earth function performed copper compound hemocyanin intense blue 
sure explanation strange people 
way notice hands yes 
strike one many fingers look fellow pointing hand many fingers many thumbs one side palm say would handy placing nuts bolts fine work suddenly lane opened crowd great black gold building came file men tight fitting green uniforms file seven foot giants 
obviously soldiers particular branch crowd number men dressed similar uniforms deep blue 
think want one us accompany arcot said 
let flip coin decide goes two better stay two go 
come back inside reasonable period time one might start making inquiries send message earth get harm way till help come 
imagine people friendly however else go 
leader troop stepped door solarite coming obviously position attention put left hand right breast equally obvious salute waited 
coin flipped due ceremony would decide distinction first terrestrians set foot venus 
arcot morey quickly put loose fitting ventilated cooling suits might live comfortably hot air outside thermometer registered two men quickly walked airlock entered closed behind opened outer door 
slight rush air pressure outside bit lower inside 
singing ears swallow several times equalize pressure 
guards fell double row either side young officer strode ahead 
curbed curiosity single startled glance given strange men

mighty clever scheme arcot straightened officer beckoned follow started long corridor lined either side large doorways much like exotic earthly office building 
passing long series branching corridors last reached one terminated large office young officer led 
snapping attention spoke briefly rapidly saluted retired two men 
man terrestrians stood tall kindly faced old gentleman 
straight black hair tinged bluish gray kindly face bore lines age smiling eyes air sincere interest gave countenance amazingly youthful air 
warm friendly despite disconcerting blueness 
looked curiously questioningly two men looked hands eyes widening surprise stepped quickly forward extended hand time looking toward arcot 
smiling arcot extended 
venerian grasped exclamation part mutually released arcot feeling uncomfortable sensation heat venerian felt flash intense cold stared hand hand surprise smile curved blue lips venerian emphatically put hand side 
arcot smiled turn said morey animated tone body temperature least fahrenheit

nice little map solar system mercury venus earth moon mars rest 
drawn several satellites jupiter saturn 
venerian pointed mars looked inquisitively 
arcot shook head pointed quickly earth 
venetian seemed bit surprised thought moment nodded satisfaction 
looked arcot intently 
latter amazement seemed form mind thought first vague quickly taking definite form 
man earth seemed say thank saved nation 
want thank quick response signals 
thought could answer us soon 
venerian seemed relax message finished 
obviously required great mental effort 
arcot looked steadily eyes tried concentrate message series ideas 
trained though deep concentration one idea process visualizing series ideas new difficult 
soon saw making progress 
came response signals exploration saw battle aided city seemed doomed seemed beautiful destroyed 
arcot asked morey wonderingly watched staring 
mental telepathy arcot answered briefly 
terribly thick point view learned sent signals earth learned making progress 
crack strain find sooner later wait see 
turned venerian 
latter frowning rather dubiously 
sudden decision turned desk pulled small lever 
looked intently arcot 
come strain conversation great see thought transference world 
come along morey going somewhere 
says thought transference much us 
wonder going maze halls went led kindly seven foot venerian 
walking long series halls reached large auditorium already gathered semi circle seats hundred tall blue tinged venerians 
low platform two large deeply cushioned chairs 
chairs two terrestrians led 
try teach language telepathically 
give ideas must learn pronunciation much quicker 
seat chairs relax 
chairs designed seven footers 
men six feet six feet six respectively yet seemed sank cushions never felt comfortable chairs 
designed put every muscle every nerve rest 
luxuriously almost spite relaxed 
dimly arcot felt wave sleepiness sweep yawned prodigiously 
conscious awareness sinking deep slumber 
seemed suddenly visions began fill mind visions developed returning consciousness dark dream world 
saw mighty fleet whose individual planes mile long three quarters mile wingspread titanic monoplanes whose droning thunder seemed roar space 
suddenly spurted great stream dazzling brilliance intense glow reached touched city 
awful concussion blasted ears 
world erupted unimaginable brilliance darkness fell 
another vision filled mind vision fleet hanging giant crater molten rock crater gaped angrily plain beside low green hills crater city

startled confused forehead furrowed rose unsteadily feet 
head seemed whirling throes terrific headache 
men looking anxiously 
glanced toward morey 
sleeping deeply seat features reflecting sensations 
turn learn new language see visions 
old venerian brought walked arcot spoke softly musical language language sibilant predominated liquid sounds gutturals nasals musical language earth men ever heard arcot started surprise understood perfectly language familiar english 
taught language quickly possible may headache must know know soon possible 
may well fate two worlds hangs actions 
men concentrated taught rapidly massed power minds giving visions know preparation 
must get back wonderful ship quickly possible yet must know happened world last years well happened twenty centuries ago 
come office talk 
friend also learned may tell 
quickly arcot followed venerian long corridors building 
people met seemed intent business paying little attention 
last seated office arcot first met escort listened new history history another planet 
name tonlos old man said 
leader people though title position unimportant 
explain would entail prolonged discussion social structure time 
later perhaps history 
twenty centuries ago tonlos continued two great rival nations planet 
planet turo naturally divided would tendency toward division 
two enormous belts land around globe one running degrees north equator degrees north 
country lanor 
south similar great belt land almost identical size kaxor 
two nations existed many thousands years 
two thousand years ago great crisis arose affairs world great war process starting lanorian developed weapon made impossible kaxorians win war averted 
feeling strong however laws passed stopped intercourse two nations thousands years 
devious ways learned kaxor concentrated study physics perhaps hopes finding weapon could threaten us 
lanor studied secrets human mind body 
disease longer insanity 
students chemistry physics neglected great extent 
recently however taken science since alone main sciences received study 
twenty five years spent researches short time hope kaxorians done two thousand 
secret heat ray weapon prevented last war almost forgotten 
required diligent research bring life inefficient machine 
late however able improve used commerce smelt ores 
alone allowed city put slight resistance 
surely doomed 
capital lanor sonor 
nation would fallen 
warning coming 
spies kaxor learned intentions flew first giant planes one cities dropped bomb trying since discovered awful scope plans send warning could help us 
come particular time almost beyond belief practically impossible coincidence perhaps coincidence behind knows paused briefly went heavy sigh since drove plane away expect new raid moment must prepared 
way signal planet yes signal easily arcot answered struggled newly acquired language 
know word tongue may radio call akin light vastly longer wavelength 
produced electrically directed like light sent beam means reflection 
penetrate substances except metals leak around directional 
talk readily men earth night 
arcot paused frowning thoughtfully continued know definite need haste anything morey received knowledge given 
waiting might well learn planet 
know intelligently able plan defense 
conversation followed arcot gained general knowledge physical makeup venus 
learned iron exceedingly rare element planet platinum relatively plentiful 
gold though readily available considered nuisance since practical value due softness excessive weight affinity many catalysts 
metallic elements present quantities approximating earth except element called morlus 
tonlos mentioned arcot said morlus word language know element 
tonlos handed arcot small block metal used weight table one corner room 
seemed fairly dense heavy iron remarkably bluish tint 
obviously element composed wings airplane seen afternoon 
arcot examined carefully handicapped somewhat heat 
picked small copper rod tried scratch noticeable effect 
scratch copper said tonlos 
second hardest metal know hard chromium far less brittle 
malleable ductile strong tough especially alloyed iron alloys used particular work iron rarity 
indicating bluish block arcot said like identify element 
may take back ship test may means 
considerable difficulty getting solution however 
attacked boiling selenic acid must know dissolves platinum readily 
usual test element dissolve oxidize acid test radium selenate brilliant greenish blue salt test radium selenate arcot exclaimed 
radium salts whatever earth could use purpose 
radium exceedingly rare radium means plentiful tonlos replied seldom test morlus plenty radium salts purpose 
never found use radium active combines water sodium soft useless metal dangerous handle 
chemists never able understand always kind reaction matter still gives light gas helium heavy gas niton unaccountable amount heat 
world vastly different arcot commented 
told tonlos different metals earth non metals occurrence 
try would could place metal tonlos given 
morey arrival interrupted discussion 
looked tired serious 
head ached unwonted mental strain arcot 
briefly arcot told learned concluding question morey thought two planets members solar family different 
idea said morey slowly seem wacky 
know means solar photography astronomers mapped sun charting location different elements 
seen hydrogen oxygen silicon others sun aged elements must mixed thoroughly 
yet seen vast areas single elements 
areas vast could easily source entire world wonder possible earth thrown deposit rich iron aluminum calcium poor gold radium metals particularly poor one element 
located sun spectrum element named coronium think specimen coronium hand say venus came coronium rich region discussion ended already light outside deepened murky twilight 
terrestrians led quickly elevator dropped rapidly ground 
still large crowd solarite way quickly cleared

morey busy power room sending signals across forty million miles space separated home planet arcot told wade fuller learned 
morey finally succeeded getting message returned say would waiting one hour 
wait eight minutes sending message get answer however due time required radio waves make two way trip 
fuller arcot said chef suppose see concoct wade start piece coronium see learn

three figures entered airlock solarite muffled heavy garments large conditions come one time 
much arcot showed totally new 
much could explain physics yet reached stage 
one thing could show 
samples liquids wanted chemistry developed point permitted communication necessary data arcot told formula wade gas 
ability penetrate material ordinary temperatures combined anesthetic properties gave obvious advantages weapon rendering opposing forces defenseless 
since able penetrate substances means storing 
hence made form two liquids reacted spontaneously produced gas projected spot needed 
arcot asked venerian chemists make supply two liquids promptly agreed 
felt would fighting chance combatting enemy could capture one flying forts 
seemed strange task capturing huge machine tiny solarite arcot felt good possibility supply gas 
one difficulty one step synthesis required considerable quantity chlorine 
since chlorine rare venus men forced sacrifice salt supply chlorine generated could used 
quite late venerians left go scalding hot rain rain seemed cold drizzle 
gone terrestrians turned night leaving telephone connection armed guard outside 
dull light venerian day filtering windows next morning terrestrians awoke 
eight clock new york time sonor working twenty three hour day 
happened sonor new york opposition midnight two nights ago meant ten clock sonorian time 
result arcot left car speak officer charge guard ship 
need pure water water free copper salts 
think would best get water distilled 
drinking 
also need two tons water kind ship tanks need recharging 
like ton drinking water 
arcot translate terrestrian measures corresponding venerian terms course still officer seemed puzzled 
large amount water would create real problem transportation 
apparently conferring telepathic means superiors officer asked solarite could moved accessible place 
arcot agreed moved spot outside city water could procured directly stream 
drinking water would ready returned city 
solarite moved bank little river electrolysis apparatus set beside 
previous day ever since landed venus power coming storage cells electrolysis apparatus establish heavy constant drain arcot started generator charge cells work needed 
throughout day could heard steady hum generator throb throb throb oxygen pump gas pumped huge tanks 
apparatus using produced gas rapidly near nightfall huge tanks filled 
even bit room atomic hydrogen simultaneously formed although twice much hydrogen oxygen produced 
task completed solarite rose sped toward distant city 
soft red glow filled sky even miles clouds intense sun able force direct rays city lighted warm radiance 
floodlights yet turned great buildings looming high ruddy light wonderfully impressive effect heightened planned construction individual spires single mass grew ground tower high air like man made mountain 
back capital solarite settled broad avenue cut traffic allotted resting place 
tonlos met shortly settled place five men carrying two large bottles 
ah co tonlos pronounced terrestrian name able make much materials needed gas made great amount tried animal whose blood structure found effect case iodide potassium effective awakening victim sorlus 
know whether tried terrestrial animals 
luckily sorlus plentiful halogen groups far chlorine bromine iodine 
sorlus know must one elements earth 
properties much like iodine heavier 
black solid melting degrees metallic looking element conduct electricity somewhat oxidizes air form acidic oxide forms strong oxygen acids 
far less active iodine except toward oxygen 
slightly soluble water 
react readily hydrogen acid formed strong hi 
seen many new things wonder may element precedes niton 
heavier replied tonlos lighter element call niton 
think none 
said arcot must next member halogen series morey 
bet number heavier elements 
gas loaded aboard solarite evening wade saw quantity said rather disappointingly small laughed heartily 
small know gas enough stuff gas whole city 
bring ship tell go making use ships 
night spoke earth morey senior told work already way hundred small ships 
using ships already government got ready act idea danger 
difficult convince someone venus getting ready send force earth destroy weight scientific reputation turned trick 
ships construction would ready three weeks 
would unable go space would fast capable carrying large tanks gas producing chemicals 
near midnight venerian time turned 
following day planned start kaxorian construction camp 
learned tonlos five giant planes completed fifteen construction make fleet twenty attack earth 
fifteen others would ready week less 
ready solarite would stand small chance 
must capture one giants learn secrets possible weapons knowledge two worlds defeat 
large order opportunity came sooner hoped wanted 
three clock morning telephone warning hummed loudly ship

arcot snapped loud speaker circuit looked sudden crash thundered mighty waves sound giant plane struck twenty feet top nearly perpendicular cliff 
terrific crash felt seismographs sonor nearly two thousand miles away mighty armored hull plowed rocks like gigantic meteor hundreds thousands tons crushing rocky precipice grinding powder shaking entire hill 
cliff seemed buckle crack 
moments plane brought rest plowed twenty feet rock nearly eighth mile 
instant hung motionless perched perilously air tail jutting little valley slowly majestically sank strike reverberating crash shattered heavy armor plate another instant great motors continued turning roar propellers like throbbing background rending crashes titanic wreck came rest

blast air blew dust away terrestrians stared unbounded amazement 
gaping broken wing lanced mighty beam light dazzling intensity arcot swiftly restored visibility might shut 
terrific hissing crackling roar 
plane seemed wobble lay seemingly recoiling flaming column 
touched cliff intense incandescence made rock glow white hot flow sluggish rivulet molten lava five minutes longer terrific spectacle lasted arcot withdrew solarite safer distance 
fifty motors remaining wing seemed slowing suddenly crash towering flash light human ever seen clouds shot mighty flame blazing column light seemed reach space 
solarite hurled back end end tumbling falling 
even heavy gyroscopes could hold instant quickly straining motors brought rest air whirled whined 
twenty miles scene explosion even distance could see glow incandescent rock 
slowly cautiously maneuvered solarite back spot looked sea seething lava morey broke awed silence

abruptly arcot exclaimed must capture ship 
try either destroy capture either way ahead aimlessly continued leisurely course across vast plain 
great mountains venus world known violent upheaval making moon 
men lost thought intent ideas

suddenly invisible solarite flashed ahead great plane 
titanic wave rushing sound engulfed came little hiss gas 
hills sight far eye could see 
dim light seemed always filter gray clouds could see distant level horizon 
several dragging minutes passed evident effect men earth waiting great ship waver wobble course 
suddenly arcot gave cry surprise 
startled amazement written face companions turned wonderment see partially visible solarite become misty ghost ship becoming visible instant gone saw huge black bulk behind wavering turning thunderous roar propellers fell whistling whine ship losing speed dipped shot bit gained speed step step glided surface 
engines idling plane running slowly

wade arcot elected make first inspection kaxorian plane clad cooling suits stepped solarite carrying emergency use small hand torch burning atomic hydrogen capable melting way even heavy armor great plane 
stood beside looking gigantic wall metal rose sheer beside hundreds feet straight seemed impossible mighty thing could fly could propelled air 
awed silence gazed vast bulk 
like pygmies beside mighty prehistoric monster made way along side seeking door 
suddenly wade stopped short exclaimed arcot senseless machine big take us half hour steady walking go around 
use solarite find entrance well followed wade plan entrance later learned top 
back giant solarite landed great weight slightest effect kaxorian craft 
found trap door leading inside 
however apparatus opening evidently within hull burn hole door could enter 
sight men earth 
low rumble idling engines barely audible descended long ladder 
resemblance whatever interior flying machine rather suggested great power house energies half nation generated 
entered directly vast hall extended quarter mile back great hull completely across fuselage 
extreme nose ran throughout scattered little globes gave intense white light illuminating interior 
translucent bull eyes obscured windows 
among machines lay venerians 
dead seemed illusion intensified strangely blue complexions 
two terrestrians knew however could readily restored life 
great machines operating humming softly almost inaudibly 
two long rows extending end great hall 
suggested mighty generators twenty feet high 
tops projected two feet thick cylinders solid fused quartz 
extended rods fused quartz rods led floor less bulky scarcely eight inches thick 
huge generator like machines disc shaped 
quartz rod ran floor 
machines row way different front half row tubes leading floor tubes jutting ceiling 
instead many slender rods connected vast switchboard covered one side great room 
everywhere great quartz rods suggesting complicated water system 
painted black though main rods leading roof clear crystal 
arcot wade looked gigantic machines hushed awe 
seemed impossibly huge inconceivable power room airplane without speaking descended level using quite earthly appearing escalator 
despite motionless figures everywhere felt fear encountering resistance 
knew effectiveness wade anesthetic 
hall entered evidently main room plane 
long one higher yet vast space taken one single titanic coil stretched wall wall led two gigantic columns fused quartz 
rods smaller ones obvious eight feet thick short led one mighty generator seen magnified scale inconceivable end driving power motor great cylindrical case led single quartz bar ten inches thick 
bar alive pulsing glowing fires changed maneuvered died surface volume 
motor five feet diameter scant seven feet long yet obviously driving great machine came constant low hum deep pitched song awful power 
huge quartz rod led titanic coil cylinder alive glowing fires played motor rod 
one side generator ran two objects familiar copper bus bars 
even three feet thick scores quartz tubes come floor joined coalesced ran great generator 
descended another level 
quartz tubes led still floor contained individual sleeping bunks unoccupied unready occupancy though made 
another level bunks little individual rooms 
last reached bottom level great quartz tubes terminated hundred smaller ones leading strange mechanism 
sighting devices ports opened floor 
evidently bombing room 
occasional hushed word terrestrians walked seemed vast city dead passing sleeping officers crewmen hundreds 
third level came last control room 
switchboards control panels dozens officers sleeping beside instruments 
sudden dull thudding sound spun arcot wade around nerves taut 
relaxed exchanged apologetic smiles 
automatic relay adjusted mechanism 
noted one man stationed apart rest 
sat bow protected behind eight inch coronium plates set masses fused quartz nearly strong metal 
gave view every direction except directly behind 
obviously pilot 
returning top level entered long passages led titanic wings 
elsewhere ship brightly lighted 
came small room another bunk room 
great numbers sides long corridor along two parallel corridors wing 
fourth corridor near back edge wing bunk rooms one side bombing posts 
continued walking first corridor came small room whence issued low hum one motors 
entering found crew sleeping motor idling 
good lord wade exclaimed 
look motor arcot bigger trunk man body 
yet battery sends ship along mile second power slowly proceeded long hall 
fifty engine mountings found conditions 
end hall escalator led one level higher upper wing 
found long rows bombing posts corresponding quartz rods 
returned finally control room 
arcot spent long time looking many instruments controls piloting apparatus 
wade said last think see done 
going stop engines start accelerate till ship rolls bit arcot stepped quickly pilots seat lifted sleeping pilot settled place 
go board one ask please turn control one yes turn one notch time 
wade shook head dubiously one sided grin face 
right arcot say think powers playing well mistake might unhealthy going stop motors arcot announced quietly 
time board aware barely inaudible whine motors 
suddenly gone plane still death arcot voice sounded unnaturally loud 
without blowing ship going try turning power suddenly throaty hum quickly became low whine arcot turned throttle heard tens thousands horsepower spring life suddenly whine low roar mighty propellers became blur majestic slowness huge machine moved across field arcot shut motors rose broad relieved smile easy said 
made way ship room tremendous cylinder coil power room 
machines quiet motors longer working 
arcot shut biggest machine 
come wade 
shut control use 
tell get back solarite 
last left mighty machine walked across broad metal top 
saw ends quartz cylinders 
entered solarite air lock took cumbersome insulating suits 
quickly possible arcot outlined two stayed solarite things seen layout great ship 
think understand secret power different solarite 
draws power sun though different way stores within solarite try 
light course energy therefore mass 
exerts pressure impact moving units energy photons 
electrons protons matter photons light 
know mass protons electrons attract protons electrons hold near stone solar system 
new idea photons attract ever powerfully closer get 
kaxorians developed method getting close together least hold little pressure stay indefinitely 
huge coil cylinder found saw main power storage tank 
full gaseous light energy held together attraction plus little help generator little help wade exclaimed 
quite little bet thing million horsepower motor yes bet nearly fifty pounds light condensed worry little thing like million horsepower plenty comes 
think go clouds way collect sun energy 
remember venus gets twice much earth 
focus tubes roof like quartz tubes conduct light condensers first collected 
led big condenser downstairs final power added condensed light stored 
quartz conducts light copper conducts electricity bus bars saw running around 
bombs meeting recently course little knots light energy thrown projector mechanism saw 
hit anything object absorbs energy promptly volatilized heat absorption 
remember column hissing radiance saw shooting wrecked plane blew motor connection broken discharging free energy 
would ordinarily supplied fifty motors full speed 
naturally cut loose rather violent 
main generator damaged doubt stopped working gravitational attraction photons enough without influence hold bound long 
floods energy released instantaneously course 
look come lanorians 
want go back sonor think problem 
perhaps find something release energy though honestly doubt 
arcot seemed depressed overawed perhaps sheer magnitude force lay bound kaxorian ship 
seemed inconceivable little solarite could way effective incredible machine 
lanorian planes landing almost like flock birds wings fuselage ground gigantic ship 
arcot dropped chair gazing moodily emptiness thoughts mighty giant stricken sleeping 
vast hulk lay energies intelligence never controlled within knew locked powers sun 
could solarite oh almost forgot mention 
arcot spoke slowly dejectedly 
heat attack back went practically unnoticed 
weapon beside gas useless 
remember ship seemed lose invisibility instant learned investigated ship 
men physicists highest order 
must realize terrible forces physical mental meet 
solved secret invisibility neutralize 
began using bit late time located radio produced interference caused ship invisibility apparatus sending beam interfering radio energy us 
invisible reason vibration molecules response radio impressed oscillations 
molecules vibrate tune terrific frequency light pass perfectly 
happen however someone locates source radio waves simple send radio beam touch invisible ship 
two radio waves impressed us step interference instantly make us visible 
longer attack atomic hydrogen blast gas useless unless get close come within ten miles 
bombs effective distance 
fell silent thinking hoping idea would give chance combat kaxorians 
three companions equally depressed without workable idea remained silent 
abruptly arcot stood 
going speak commander field 
start back sonor maybe better head home 
looks though little 
briefly spoke young venerian officer told learned ship 
perhaps could fly sonor could left undestroyed would open certain control left 
arcot showed one would drain power great storage tank throwing harmlessly clouds 
kaxorians might destroy machine wanted arcot felt would wish 
would hope reason might recapture would impossible move tremendous machine without power tank intended hold 
vii slowly cruised back sonor arcot still engrossed thought 
would venus would fall attack mighty planes would sweep across space earth mars worlds cosmic menace would mighty machines soon circling earth guided missiles atomic warheads could combat perhaps could molecular motion machines 
perhaps could armored twenty inch steel walls driven great propellers miles second ship ships would require long hours days even weeks build time kaxorian fleet would ready 
would attack earth within six days hope avert incalculable destruction outright defeat despair arcot turned strode quickly long hallway solarite 
could hear smooth even hum sweetly functioning generator reminded vastly greater energies seen controlled night 
thudding relays power room wade maneuvered ship seemed diminutive mockery giant relays seen power room kaxorian plane 
sat power room looking stacked apparatus neatly arranged must get apparatus small space 
last began think calmly 
concentrated greatest forces known man two even occurred great one vast energies night learned force molecules force drove ship 
time work mathematics light compression mathematics knew would give results 
remained molecular motion 
could done drew small black notebook 
symbols formulas page page intricate calculus ended finally harnessing great force even carrying smoothly along 
half hour later still busy covering page page swiftly written formulas 
great table multiple integers one like known exist system multiple calculus invention arcot last found expression wanted carefully checked work excitedly though expression eager hope seemed logical seemed correct morey oh morey called holding enthusiasm check come want check math 
done want see get result independently morey careful mathematician arcot turned verification new discovery 
following general directions arcot gave morey went long series calculations arrived results 
slowly looked brief expression ended 
formula astonished physical significance 
arcot think make new expression arcot eyes tightness mouth 
hope morey 
lanor lost beyond doubt probably earth 
wade come minute let fuller take controls tell push 
get work 
rapidly arcot explained calculations proof gotten 
beam molecular motion controlling energy directs molecular motion go right angles 
mechanism far field inside coil really figures right means project field considerable distance even air 
beam power cause molecules path move right angles direction choose reversing power projector 
means matter big thing tear pieces use powers energies rip crush 
imagine would happen directed side mountain entire mass rock would fly unimaginable speed crashing ahead terrific power molecules suddenly moved direction 
nothing universe could hold together disintegration ray sort ray tear crush either make one half move away reverse power make one half drive toward terrific power molecules omnipotent hmmm arcot paused narrowing eyes thought 
one limitation 
reach far air vacuum infinite range atmosphere molecules air affected cause terrific blast icy wind gale temperatures far zero even effective venus must start designing thing take immorpho give let sleep accumulate till time look sonor already land us fuller right come back 
going need gorgeous display venerian dawn already coloring east great buildings seemed rise silently 
sky dull luminous gray gray rapidly grew brighter brighter like molten silver filtering early rays intense sun 
sun rose horizon though invisible clouds still traceable wondrous shell pink began suffuse ten mile layer vapor 
tiny droplets however breaking clear light million rainbows swiftly deepening pink forming concentric circles blue green orange colors rainbow repeated time time wondrous halo glowing color doubly intense sun could create 
almost worth missing sun day see sunrises sunsets fuller commented 
men watching despite need haste 
sight like earthman ever seen 
immediately plunged extremely complex calculation electrical apparatus produce necessary fields 
get effect wanted must two separate fields director ray third field slightly different nature would cause director ray move one direction 
would disconcerting say least director ray mistake turn upon work went swiftly considered possible still much done theoretical end job alone streets began fill 
noticed large crowd assembling shortly finished people stood hour half crowd grown great size 
looks collection say become principals kind celebration know nothing 
well case want us ready come 
guard always surrounded solarite doubled maintaining fairly large clear area ship 
shortly thereafter saw one high officials lanor come walk governmental building walking toward solarite 
time us appear may well us time 
tell say afterward wade 
evidently gone considerable trouble get meeting let cooperate 
hate slow work try make short 
four terrestrians got cooling suits stepped outside ship 
lanorian dignitary left guard walked quartet earth measured tread halted 
earthmen began deep clear voice gathered morning greet thank tremendous service done us 
across awful void empty space journeyed forty million miles visit us discover venerians making ready attack world

perhaps saved city may made possible save world earth 
battle begun 
kaxorian camp eighteen great ships 
badly defeated three encounters solarite far 
longer vulnerable earlier methods attack 
spies report first plane plane first attacked solarite still undergoing repairs 
completed within two days leave base guard two ships attack 
furthermore attack new weapon 
destroyed usefulness weapon invisibility turn use us must seek new weapon 
hope right track every moment precious must get back work 
address must short 
later completed preliminary work give plans workmen able turn metal lack materials 
help may succeed despite handicap 
address terminated 
lanorians probably disappointed fully realized necessity haste 
wish terrestrian orators spoke like remarked morey returned ship 
said say run miles speech 
forceful speaker people speak briefly point generally arcot said 
nearly noon day theoretical discussion reduced practical terms 
ready start work reason work cheerfully 
even air found ray would able reach thirty five miles would well danger zone attacking gigantic planes kaxor 
morey wade arcot set work constructing electrical plant give necessary power 
lucky indeed brought great mass spare apparatus enough make electrical machinery 
tubes coils condensers 
generator would easily supply power terrific forces destroy kaxorian ships generated plane 
destroy solarite would merely detonator set physicists busy fuller designing mechanical details projector 
must able turn spherical angle degrees necessarily controlled electrically inside 
details projector worked six evening numerous castings machined pieces used made venerian machine shops 
one difficulty another arose overcome 
night came still continued work 
venerian workmen promised apparatus ten clock next morning corresponded ten clock 
shortly three clock morning finished apparatus connected controls placed last projector directors 
except projector ready morey wade fuller turned get sleep could 
arcot telling something wished get took another dose immorpho stepped steaming rain 
minutes ten next morning arcot came back followed half dozen venerians carrying large metal cylinder cradle 
attached landing gear solarite fashion fusing one piece wire would permit entire thing drop free 
hatched eh asked wade entered ship 
thing want try going keep deep dark secret 
think get quite surprise see bombs action arranged released turning current landing lights 
forgo lights present needed bombs 
mechanics finished working projector parts fuller short time 
comes little gang asked help us 
direct 
arcot paused scowled annoyance 
hang drill outer wall lose vacuum two walls hot air come 
place roasting short time 
molecular motion coolers afraid much good 
use generator cut main room vacuum wall 
think better charge gas tanks batteries soon done 
tonight attack kaxorian construction camp

somewhat later came sound drills whistling roar air sucked vacuum told men inside work way 
soon became uncomfortably hot vacuum destroyed heat came sides 
little molecular coolers could handle temperature soon rose hundred fifteen 
bad venerian atmosphere air seemed exceedingly dry men found possible get along without cooling suits work 
since little could simply relaxed 
nearly dark lanorians finished work gas tanks recharged 
time arcot spent tonlos determining position kaxorian construction camp 
spy reports old maps helped impossible accurate work means 
finally decided kaxorian construction camp miles southwest 
solarite start hour dark 
travelling westward speed hoped reach camp nightfall 
viii solarite sped swiftly toward southwest 
sky slowly grew lighter miles flashed beneath

wade shook head 
look fuller problem handle let alone suppose problem time thing arcot groaned 
tired 
let get sleep first anyway 
sure makes good sense wade agreed 
sleep yes 
go sleep well bright sonorans tried 
hand say elected 
kaxorians undoubtedly nice two thousand year old hatred sonorans snobbishly ignored isolated considered unfit association 
sonorans hand thoroughly scared feeling correspondingly vindictive 
time fluke coming 
see two peoples getting together settling kind sensible long term treaty mutual cooperation arcot morey nodded wearily 
annoyingly correct morey agreed 
know blasted well none us going sleep line attack white elephant disposal problem 
anybody ideas fuller looked three 
know design two incompatible materials must structurally united tie third material compatible 
sonor win fight 
kaxor win 
earth persona solarite 
earth mad anybody damaged anybody knowingly ignoring anybody 
sonorans want let alone work learn

wade called arcot tensely snapped switch televisophone bring morey meet machine roof 
call washington 
explain soon get 
roof arcot opened hangar doors entered five passenger molecular motion ship inside 
sleek streamlined sides spoke power speed 
special research model designed experiments carrying mechanisms found commercial crafts 
among automatic controls still laboratory stage permitting higher speed human could control ship accurately 
took trio little less quarter hour make mile trip new york battlefield canada

three passed lines settled ground beside one huge ships lay half buried ground 
force impact splashed solid soil stone splash soft mud around ship massive ridge earth 
arcot looked titanic proportions ship space turned friends investigate wreck foot think far sensible see car 
monster certainly mile long spend time walking investigation

beats even huge kaxorian planes size 
arcot paused grinned 
sure would liked mix fight must nice little things play would make nice toy agreed wade looked rows wicked looking projectors along sides metal hull wonder might crew alive size ship would prevent showing quickly since move ship seems let us know shortly around 
probably engines stopped main weapons useless would doubtless sort guns 
highly favor using car 
carry molecular director ray way blocked make new one 
wade attention caught sudden flare light miles across plain 
look ship still flaming reddish almost colorless 
looks like gas flame bit calcium 
almost air ship combustible 
exploring baby suggest use altitude suits harm case 
three four great wrecks spread wide area burning hurling forth long tongues colorless intensely hot flame 
several ships slightly damaged one brought beam torn free entire tail ship leaving bow good condition 
apparently machine fallen far perhaps pilot retained partial control ship power failing comparatively short distance earth 
rather well one side plain however decided investigate later 
ship nearest crashed nose first point crushed shattered 
arcot maneuvered craft cautiously toward great hole nose ship entered mighty vessel slowly powerful spotlight illuminating interior 
tremendous girders twisted broken force impact thrust 
soon became evident little fear living enemies proceeded rapidly 
certainly creature could live shock broken huge girders several times metal beams blocked path forced use molecular director ray bend way 
man said arcot stopped moment clear away huge member bent across path beams look built permanently hate ram one look one anywhere near strength steel think force took bend last penetrated long tube led length ship communication tube 
admitted small ship easily moved swiftly along till came believed center invader 
arcot proposed step see seen 
others agreed put altitude suits heavy rubberized canvas designed worn outside ship high altitude even space 
supplied oxygen tanks would keep wearer alive six hours 
unless atmosphere remaining alien ship excessively corrosive would safe 
brief discussion decided would go met opposition would strength numbers 
met first difficulty opening door leading communication tube 
automatic door resisted every effort finally forced tear ray 
impossible move way 
door floor since ship seemed landed one side rather keel 
let narrow opening one time landed sloping wall corridor beyond 
lucky big room nice drop far wall commented wade 
suits equipped thin vibrating diaphragm made speech easy wade voice came queerly metallic ring 
arcot agreed somewhat absently attention directed toward surroundings 
hand light pierced blackness finally halting gaping opening apparently entrance corridor 
examined saw slanted steeply downward 
seems quite drop said wade turned light surface seems rather rough 
think 
notice brought rope morey think help 
go first unless someone else wants honor 
go first arcot hesitated briefly 
know going guess better 
would take two ordinary men lower big bulk like 
hand anybody going stay delegated elevator boy hold everything continued arcot 
idea 
think none us need hold weight others rope 
wade get three fairly good sized pieces metal something tie rope think get without help anyone else 
morey cut rope three equal pieces help wade tear loose girder arcot refused reveal idea till preparations complete worked quickly efficiently 
aid wade soon three short members taking rope morey prepared tied lengths cord pieces metal leaving twenty foot lengths hanging 
carefully tested handiwork make sure knots would slip 
let see 
arcot put small loop one end cord thrust left wrist grasped rope firmly hand 
drew ray pistol adjusted carefully direction action 
trigger gave control power 
finally turned ray block metal end rope 
metal pulled vigorously drawing rope taut arcot increased power dragged slowly across floor 
ah works 
grinned broadly shoulder 
come boys hitch wagon star go investigation 
new double action parachute 
lets easy pulls easier think go want 
pause added tell much power bad arcot simple brake lowered corridor descending one time avoid contact ray since touch beam fatal 
scene lay one colossal destruction 
evidently stumbled upon engine room 
could hope illuminate vast expanse little hand lights could gain idea magnitude original layout 
floor tilted steep angle torn many places showing great massive beams buckled twisted like many wires heavy floor plates crumpled like much foil 
everywhere room seemed covered film white silvery metal silver decided brief examination spattered broadcast walls room 
suddenly morey pointed ceilingward light 
silver came exclaimed 
network heavy bars ran across roof great bars solid silver fully three feet thick 
one section gaped ragged hole suggesting work disintegration ray hole went metal roof one plainly fused great silver bars 
arcot looked wonder heavy metal bars 
lord bus bars three feet thick engines must look way blown short circuited crash generator went volatilized juice aid improvised elevators three men attempted explore tremendous chamber 
scarcely begun wade exclaimed bodies crowded around gruesome find caught first glimpse invaders space 
anatomical details could distinguished since bodies caught rain crushing beams saw different terrestrians venerians though blood seemed strangely pallid skin ghastly whiteness 
evidently assembled unfamiliar sort instrument panel catastrophe struck morey indicated dials keys 
nice know fighting arcot observed 
hunch see critters alive ship turned away resumed examination shattered mechanisms 
careful examination impossible wrecks arcot see seemed mainly giant electrical machines standard types though gargantuan scale 
titanic masses wrecked metal iron silver men silver seemed replace copper though nothing could replace iron magnetic uses 
electrical machines guess said arcot last 
size seen anything really revolutionary wade wade frowned answered 
two things bother 
come 
arcot jumped nearly suspended ray pistol wade directed light small machine fallen cracks giant mass broken generators 
little thing apparently housed glass case 
one objection assumption 
base large generator lay metal fully two feet thick metal cracked rested case case made material inch half thick dented whewww nice kind glass morey commented 
like specimen examination 
oh wonder yes must window side toward bow seemed stuff 
buried three feet solid earth imagine must 
three made way seen window 
frame appeared steel alloy twisted bent blow evidently outer wall impact landing flattened rounded side 
glass window quite undisturbed proof large granite boulder lying outside boulder though shattered impact 
say building material arcot indicated transparent sheet 
look granite rock smashed sand yet window even scratched look frame held torn torn broken 
wonder tear loose altogether stepped forward raising pistol 
thud metal bar crashed ray shut 
others got way stepped toward window directed beam toward 
gradually increased power till suddenly rending crash saw leaping column earth sand broken granite flying hole steel shell 
sudden violent crash moment later second equally violent crash window flown ceiling came thumping back floor 
dust settled came forward looking window 
found somewhat buried rubbish lying one side 
arcot bent tilt sweep dirt grasped one hand pulled 
window remained 
grasped hands pulled harder 
window remained 
uh say lend hand wade 
together two men pulled without results 
window three feet two feet one inch making total volume one half cubic foot certainly heavy 
could begin move 
equal volume lead would weighed four hundred pounds decidedly four hundred pounds 
indeed combined strength three men rock 
well certainly kind matter know observed morey 
osmium heaviest known metal density twenty two half would weigh pounds 
think could lift heavier anything know 
least proof new system 
venus earth found every element occurs sun 
people must come another star either returned arcot proof amazing degree technological advancement 
guess course idea kind matter exists solar system 
think already seen gaseous state 
remember course kaxorians great reservoirs storing light energy bound state giant planes 
bound light light held gravitational attraction condensing apparatus amounted gas gaseous light 
suppose someone makes light condenser even powerful one kaxorians used condenser forces light close increases density till photons hold permanently substance becomes solid 
matter matter made light light matter let us call metal 
know ordinary matter electricity matter electricity matter metals conduct electricity readily 
light matter metal conduct light would wonderful substance windows 
comes question moving wade interposed 
lift certainly want examine 
means must take laboratory 
believe place clearly quite permanently demolished 
think better return ship start machine saw appear badly damaged 
move think ray may trick 
arcot drew ray pistol stepped back bit holding weapon ray would direct plate straight 
slowly applied power gradually increased plate stirred moved air 
works use pistol morey direct toward corridor 
send let fall outside pick later 
morey stepped forward arcot held air ray morey propelled slowly till directly corridor leading upward 
arcot gave sudden increase power plate moved swiftly upward sailing sight 
arcot shut ray came ears sudden crash plate fell floor 
three men regained ropes double action parachutes arcot called floated next floor 
started process moving plate 
went well till came little car 
could use ray car fear damaging machinery 
use purely mechanical method hoisting 
finally solved problem using molecular director ray swing heavy beam air one man pulled far end rope swung till resting door ship one end rested hole torn lining tube 
maneuvered heavy plate till resting beam released plate watched slide incline shooting open doorway car

ii great number scientists military men already gathered headquarters ship 
arcot party arrived learned wrecks assigned one group 
learned scientific importance go nearly perfect ship lying west 
two air patrolmen accompany 
lieutenant wright lieutenant greer go said colonel 
event trouble possible though unlikely survivors may able help 
anything men armed standard sidearms arcot asked 
think better arm new director ray pistols 
several boat 
right suppose certainly dr arcot 
command 
party increased five returned ship arcot showed men details ray pistols use 
control direction operation rather intricate early models required considerable explanation 
theoretical range even small hand weapons infinity space atmosphere energy rather rapidly absorbed ionization air dispersion beam made ineffective space range thirty five miles 
entering little molecular motion car went great hull fallen ship 
inspected cautiously overhead going close dreadnought obviously landed without terrific concussion others experienced possibility crew survived crash 
entire stern huge vessel torn evidently ship unable rise lights glowing portholes side indicating power failed completely 
think better treat monster respect remarked wade looking lighted windows 
power hull scarcely dented except stern caught beam 
lucky ray projector ships service four months lieutenant sir air patrolman replied 
gotten hand weapons sufficient quantities issued us yet 
morey scowled invader 
like 
wonder greet us beams said worried tones 
seem rays action 
less mile fallen giant moving rather slowly 
puzzled commented arcot come conclusion either ray projectors fed separate system power distribution destroyed creatures space dead 
learn later exploration ship invaders ray projectors fed separate generator produced special form alternating current wave 
generator damaged beyond use 
little machine well toward stern giant lowered till level torn metal 
plain ship subjected terrific tension 
great girders stretched broken huge ribs bent twisted 
central tube ran length ship drawn three quarters original diameter making necessary use ray enter 
moments speedster glided dark tunnel 
searchlight reaching ahead filled metal tunnel myriad deceptive reflections 
tube lighted far ahead seemed empty 
cautiously advanced arcot controls 
wade morey stop first asked 
engines probably prime importance 
know location 
say agree replied wade morey nodded approval 
ran craft long tube till reached door knew must engine room landing stepped wearing altitude suit 
ship landed level progress would much easier one 
waited moment opening door engine room led narrow corridor one could pass 
caution definitely order 
air patrolmen insisted leading way 
sent along express purpose protecting scientists duty lead 
brief argument arcot agreed 
two officers stepped door standing one side tore open ray pistols 
fell clatter rounded metal floor tube lay vibrating noisily rays death lanced beyond 
cautiously peered around corner long corridor seeing nothing entered 
wade came next arcot followed morey 
corridor approximately thirty feet long opening great engine room 
already men could hear smooth hum powerful machines could see rounded backs vast mechanisms 
sign life human otherwise 
halted finally threshold engine room 
well arcot said softly 
seen anyone far hope one seen us 
invaders may behind one big engines quite unaware us 
see us ready fight 
remember weapons tear loose anything hit take easy 
know something power engines put commission splash us landscape 
look crew get try get cautiously quickly stepped great room forming rough half circle pistols ready action 
walked forward stealthily glancing simultaneously enemies caught sight 
six invaders seven feet tall surprisingly humanoid 
somewhat resembled venerians venerians skin strange gray white suggesting raw dough 
seemed arcot strange pale creatures advancing slow walk stood still watching slowly raised strange hand weapons 
seemed notice every detail short tight fitting suits elastic material hamper movements strange flesh seemed escape transparent 
eyes strangely large black spot pupil white corneas created unnatural effect 
abruptly weapons came arcot responded sudden flick ray flung one side 
simultaneously four companions let beams fly toward invaders 
glowed strangely red still effective 
six beings suddenly gone released beams 
taken toll 
lieutenant wright lay motionless upon floor 
terrestrians scarcely chance notice immediately terrific rending crash clean daylight came pouring wide opening wall ship 
five rays stopped contact enemy touched wall behind 
irregular opening gaped smooth metal 
suddenly came second jarring thud dull explosion great sheet flame filled hole wall ruddy flame swept rapidly 
arcot swung ray pistol pointing mass flaming gas 
mighty column air came narrow corridor tube rushing toward outside taking flame 
roaring mass gas hovered outside ship 
lieutenant said arcot swiftly turn ray hole keep blowing flame outside 
find put fire keep outside ship believe reasonably safe 
patrolman obeyed instantly relieving arcot 
wade morey already bending fallen man 
afraid nothing latter said grimly every moment dangerous 
let continue investigation carry back ship leave 
arcot nodded silently 
solemnly turned away motionless figure floor set investigation 
arcot began morey moment gas burning like put let get job first replied arcot somewhat tersely 
discussion comes 
bodies invaders gone could examine 
matter doctors biologists anyway 
engines main interest huge things overshadowed everything 
must concealment afforded engines permitted three enemy get close 
warning terrestrians faint pink haze stepped around corner engine sudden feeling faintness swept 
leaped back sight peering around corner nerves muscles tensed 
sign movement 
watched saw pallid hand reaching ray gun wade swiftly pointed weapon 
came sudden crash metal groan quiet 
two aliens leaped behind great engine terrestrians dodged back swiftly found concealment 
arcot swung ray pull trigger would send huge engine toppling upon saw running 
thought unknown energies machine potential destruction shook head 
cautiously looked around edge towering mass waiting beam flashed snapping sound ray caught reaching hand hurled owner mighty transformer sort 
instant huge mass tottered still 
low concentration power arcot used small portion touched molecules portion enough tip tremendous weight 
one enemy remained arcot learned swiftly still action could dodge back came familiar pink haziness 
touched arcot hand outstretched fired sudden numbness came 
pistol hand seemed lose feeling warmth cold 
could still feel weapon deadened weight 
reflex action hurled back hand range ray 
seconds feeling began return less ten hand normal 
turned others wry grin 
whew narrow squeak must say ray gentlemenly sort thing 
either kills injure 
goes shaft pink radiance reached end engine grazing evidently absorbed mass pinning us wade grated 
certainly step open space stay indefinitely either 
reinforcements might arrive look wade pointed pistol big metal bar roof see pull may get nervous come sight 
swiftly arcot sprang forward caught arm 
lord wade much stuff know anything 
much chance smashing us 
going try get around side machine see fellows keep occupied 
arcot disappeared around black humming giant 
interminably others waited something happen suddenly beam playing irregular intervals across end machine swung quickly side simultaneously another ray seemed leap machine 
met crossed 
came momentary crashing arc went dead apparatus generated blew terrific overload 
invader evidently carried spare watchers saw dart concealment clawing pocket pouch 
turned rays projector came free ray hurled violently left 
crashed huge motor result nice 
projector jerked hand lay side 
arcot ran picked heard lieutenant call alarmed inquiry 
think okay arcot answered 
hope means stay use little power possible blowing flame outside 
uses atmosphere ship though need think better take things easy 
call us anything looks odd 
several minutes three scientists looked awe struck wonder 
first men earth see driving equipment one tremendous kaxorian planes felt tiny beside great bulk examined engine room realized even huge plane shrank insignificance beside interstellar cruiser 
loomed great rounded backs giant electric motor generators sort 
across roof ran network gigantic metal bars apparently conductors large suggested heavy structural members 
machines ran loomed fully thirty feet air longer cylinders thirty feet diameter group four main machines fully hundred twenty feet long many smaller mechanisms yet smaller ones would easily constituted complete power supply average big city 
along wall ran bank transformers cast heroic mold 
seemed connected smaller machines four conductors leading minor units two intake two apparently output leads suggesting rotary converters 
multiple units various types sizes transformers made obvious many different frequencies needed 
transformers air cores led machines surrounded silvery white metal instead usual iron 
apparently generating current extremely high frequency 
well morey commented ought power enough 
notice four main units leads radiating different directions one left seems lead big power board front better bow 
think would worth investigating 
arcot nodded 
idea 
notice two main power units still working two stopped probably two dead ones something motion ship 
one point think even greater interest 
machines seen conspicuous ones secondary power sources 
primary sources visible 
notice two main conduits lead right toward bow 
let check go 
talked followed huge conductors back point convergence 
suddenly rounded one huge main power units saw center square formed machines low platform transparent light metal 
exact center platform twenty feet diameter table seven feet across raised five feet level platform stout light metal legs 
table two huge cubes solid silver cubes ran conductors seen 
space six inches left blocks metal small box constructed strange new material 
perfect reflecting surface men ever imagined 
indeed perfect reflector unable see could detect presence mirror images fact blotted objects behind 
noticed huge blocks metal two small holes two thin wires reflecting material led holes 
wires led directly roof suspended three foot hangers light metal continued toward bow 
could source power entire ship seemed impossible yet many seeming impossible things among strangely reflecting matter 
low railing central platform apparently intended keep observers safe distance decided detailed investigation 
discuss unusual find lieutenant called heard sounds behind 
three ran rapidly toward narrow corridor given entrance 
flaming gas still shooting hole wall ship rush air corridor made difficult hear sounds exceedingly difficult walk 
turn power lieutenant see draw enemy suggested arcot braced around tube exit 
patrolman increased power beam moan air corridor increased suddenly terrific roar cyclonic gale swept 
none invaders drawn 
lieutenant shut blast pistol arcot signal latter said think anything less war tank could stand pressure 
probable attacked stay much longer though may able get 
think lieutenant ask stay go get ship ready leave 
paused grinning 
sure keep flame outside 
position hercules atlas left holding skies shoulders 
shut ray long first rate explosion 
signal ready firing revolver make ship fast travel 
arcot expression became solemn 
carry wright back ship 
brave man certainly deserves burial soil world 
morey look family 
father company take care need help 
slowly men forced way back toward ship fighting roaring column air burden hindering somewhat last reached open tunnel 
even air violent motion 
got boat quickly possible set controls reverse flight 
wade fired signal shot 
moments saw lieutenant greer bucking current air continuing momentum 
time ship ominous calm fallen 
swiftly sped corridor almost reached open air suddenly dull rumble behind caught wave pressure hurled along terrific speed 
flash sped open air great tunnel thick walls flared opening acting like gigantic blunderbus ship bullet 
arcot made attempt slow little craft pressed foot heavily vertical accelerator 
ship rocketed terrific speed acceleration pinned men seats tripled weight 
anxiously watched huge invader sped away 
arcot direction morey signaled groups scientists get danger speed warning impending blow 
moments sped tension mounted 
arcot stared fixedly screen keeping giant space ship focus 
sped mile upon miles away began relax bit 
word spoken watched waited 
actually little time passed explosion watchers seconds dragged endlessly 
twenty seven miles screen flared sheet blinding white radiance 
timeless instant tremendous wave sound roaring stunning concussion smote ship shaking unrestrained fury cease abruptly came 
immediately realized reason 
rushing away explosion faster sound made hence could hear 
first intolerable flash details became visible 
great ship seemed leap countless tremendous fragments rushing away point blow 
go far force sustained long enough great enough overcome inertia vast mass moments 
huge masses rained earth bury soil 
came momentary lull 
suddenly mass evidently held wrecked engine room shot beam intense white light swept around wide erratic arc 
whatever touched fused instantly brilliantly glowing mass liquid incandescence 
field fragments wreckage fused mingled fury 
beam began swing faster faster support holding melted abruptly turned upon 
came sudden blast brilliance rival sun entire region became molten lake 
eyes streaming temporarily blinded men turned away screen 
said arcot ruefully seems visitors want leave secrets lying around us investigate 
idea wrecks go like one 
scowled 
know really learn much 
guess better call headquarters ship ask instructions 
attend lieutenant greer iii swiftly arcot sleek cruiser sped toward new york arcot laboratories 
halted briefly headquarters ship earth venus forces report experience alone three scientists way home 
course set arcot spoke others 
well fellows opinions seen wade chemist tell us think explosion ship strange color molecular ray air 
wade shook head doubtfully 
trying figure quite believe results 
still see explanation 
reddish glow looked like hydrogen ions air 
atmosphere certainly combustible met makes impossible believe air contained noticeable amount oxygen anything twenty per cent oxygen rest hydrogen would violently explosive 
apparently gas mix liberally air reach proportion 
explode ionized showed absence hydro oxygen mixture 
observed facts except one seem point atmosphere composed largely hydrogen 
one beings living understand venerians might adapt different climate see anything approaching human life live atmosphere like 
arcot nodded 
come similar conclusions 
see much objection thought beings living atmosphere hydrogen 
question organic chemistry 
remember bodies chemical furnaces 
take fuel oxidize using heat source power 
invaders live atmosphere hydrogen 
eat oxidizing fuels breathe reducing atmosphere two fuel components together way different method 
evidently effective 
sure secret whole thing 
sounds fairly logical 
wade agreed 
question 
sun beings come arcot reply came slowly 
wondering thing 
wonder less believe come sun 
let eliminate solar planets one fell swoop 
perfectly obvious ships means first crude attempts race fly space 
dealing advanced technology 
ships even far away pluto certainly heard 
hence got go interstellar space 
probably want ram arguments throat know star near enough journey made anything less couple generations logical freeze interstellar cold 
known star close enough unknowns star morey snorted 
hiding behind sun shade arcot grinned 
yes 
shade old age 
know sun radiate forever eventually die 
dead sun would quite black sure 
planets circle apt become wee bit cool know 
agreed said arcot able much 
give beings credit little higher order intelligence 
saw machines space ship certainly beyond us undoubtedly heating planets source energy running ships 
believe confirmation statement two things 
absolutely colorless even opaque white skin 
living creature exposed rays sun certain emit chemical rays subject coloration protection rays 
whites always lived sunlight weakest developed skin slightly opaque 
orientals live tropical countries less clothes sun motto slightly darker skins 
extreme tropics nature found necessary use regular blanket color stop rays 
extrapolating way rays people would become pigmentless race 
since proteins rather translucent least wet would appear much beings 
remember colored proteins 
hemoglobin blood hemocyanin like blue blood venerians practically unique respect 
hydrogen absorption imagine blood creatures contains fair proportion highly saturated compound readily takes element gives later 
kick around lab 
starting new york arcot convinced officer charge would wise destroy complete invaders ships lest one manage escape 
fact none rays operation easily explained would destroyed patrol made show weapons 
might getting ready used possible escape attempts 
scientists preliminary investigations 
dismembered sections would remain study anyway 
ships finally rayed apart three left burning atmosphere sending mighty tongues flame mile air 
light gas alien atmosphere tended rise great globular cloud ball quickly burned 
taken long last machines disintegrate rays 
would trouble rate morey asked arcot thought learned could ships would wiser save investigate fully later taking chance stopping sudden attack surviving marauders keeping patrol air guards 
arcot replied thought quite bit suggested destruction conferred moments forsyth tops biology bacteriology 
said means learned much wished forced leave event 
remember pure hydrogen atmosphere actually living ship quite inert pure oxygen alone 
two get rough mixed together 
longer ships lay dangerously explosive became 
destroyed would wrecked 
still think followed logical course 
dr forsyth mentioned danger disease 
remote possibility might susceptible germs 
believe would chemical constitution vastly different 
instance venerians terrestrians visit perfect freedom 
venerians diseases course things blood venerians absolutely deadly terrestrian organism 
similar deadly effect venerian germs 
immunity simply respective constitutions different need immunity 
similarly forsyth thinks would completely resistant diseases brought invaders 
however safer remove danger first check afterward 
three men sped rapidly back new york flying nearly sixty miles surface earth would interfering traffic till length big city dropping swiftly vertical traffic lane 
shortly thereafter settled lightly landing cradle arcot laboratories 
arcot father morey anxiously awaiting return 
elder arcot many years held reputation nation greatest physicist recently lost son 
morey senior president chief stockholder transcontinental air lines 
arcots father son turned inventions close friends moreys 
many years success great air lines dependent large part inventions arcots new discoveries enabled keep one step ahead competition also made huge transport machines companies drew tremendous profits mechanisms 
mutual interest begun purely financial relationship long since become close personal friendship 
arcot stepped speedster called immediately father telling find light matter plate 
need handling machine move 
right back 
ran elevator dropped quickly heavy machinery lab lower floor 
short time returned tractor like machine equipped small derrick designed get power electric mains 
ran machine ship 
others looked heard rumble hum powerful motor 
crane dangled strong electro magnet 
asked wade pointing magnet 
expect magnetic wait see laughed arcot maneuvering handling machine position 
one others made contact power line crane reached ship lowering magnet plate crystal 
arcot turned power lifting motor 
hum rose swiftly volume pitch till full load began strain cables 
motor whined full power cables vibrating tension 
machine pulled steadily arcot surprise rear end machine rose abruptly floor tipping forward 
well magnetic know asked surprised wade 
since ship made venerian metal coronium slightly magnetic plate obviously magnet load 
never mind 
tell later 
get beam say twenty feet long see help lift crazy mass 
think ought manage way 
proved 
two straddling beam leverage great enough pull plate 
running elevator lowered heavy mass disconnected cable rode arcot laboratory 
beam handling machine brought play plate unloaded car 
five men gathered around amazing souvenir another world 
wade wondering knew plate magnetic son commented elder arcot 
accept explanation stuff kind matter made light know well think lucky guess 
know really pretty much guess dad though logic behind thought 
ought able trace idea morey arcot smiled friend 
kept discreetly quiet replied morey feeling silence could betray ignorance since ask guess 
seem recall light affected powerful magnet imagine basis guess 
known many years far back clerk maxwell polarized light rotated powerful magnet 
may well go whole story tell dad father happened 
perhaps telling straighten ideas bit 
next hour three men talked telling story trying explain whys wherefores seen 
end agreed one point fight enemy must ships could travel though space speed match invaders ships self contained source power 
brief lull conversation morey commented rather sarcastically wonder arcot kindly explain famous invisible light lost star bit nettled failure remember star could go black 
see connection sudden attack 
must developed star bright star requires millions years cool see could suddenly appear space 
answering arcot reached drawer desk pulled old blackened briar pipe 
methodically filled thoughtful frown face carefully lighting leaned back puffing thin column gray smoke 
creatures must developed planets sun cooled 
puffed slowly 
race millions years old believe 
give scientific reason feeling merely hunch 
feeling invaders old older planet little globe two billion years old 
feel race ancient may well counted revolutions galaxy every twenty thirty million years swung center 
looked great machines comparatively little beings handled projectors seemed place 
shrugged 
hunch impression 
paused slow smoke drifted upward 
granted premise black dead star approaching solar system theorizing may seem logical 
agree listeners nodded arcot continued 
well idea went downstairs handling machine called lunar observatory 
quite keep note triumph voice 
gentlemen planets misbehaving outermost planets even closer sun moving 
celestial body appreciable mass approaching system though thus far nothing seen visitor hubbub excited comment followed startling revelation 
arcot quieted upraised hand 
reason world large heard yet fact perturbation planets slight astronomers figured might made error calculation 
rechecking mistakes 
get back visualization must many millions years ago life developed planets black star warm sun much younger 
probably rather dim suns go even younger days 
remember sun well average brilliance heat radiation 
long gone ages imagine race much like developing differing chemically atmosphere hydrogen chemical body makes race thought process 
must developed science grew sun waned 
dimmer dimmer became planets could maintain life naturally 
heat artificially 
question source power use energy matter called atomic energy source would great enough done 
probable science developed long great need arose 
must also come process transmutation process use driving interstellar cruisers 
sure machines driven material energy 
last star black closed star cold black planets must circle hot black sun forever trapped eternity unless found way escape stellar system 
could travel fast light could escape found near solar system 
star dead black 
let call nigra black one since like every star name 
objection none arcot continued come impossibly rare coincidence 
two suns motion approach beyond point logic 
suns retinue planets approaches height ridiculous 
yet happening right 
nigrans correct term every intention taking advantage coincidence 
since sun visible long long time approaching proximity suns evident lots time prepare 
believe expedition exploratory one send huge machines many mere exploration sure must quite fleet fight 
know little weapons 
death ray quite deadly might feared solely ships could outmaneuver 
next time logically bring fleet little ships carried bellies giants real enemy 
anticipate moves build circumvent 
ray believe idea works 
familiar catalytic effects light 
hydrogen chlorine stand peacefully jar long time let strong light fall combine terrific violence 
catalytic effect vibration wave motion 
thing negative catalysis 
certain reaction third element compound introduced reaction stopped 
believe principle nigran death ray catalyst simply stops chemical reactions living body delicately balanced least resistance upset 
arcot halted sat puffing furiously moment 
discourse pipe died ember vigorous puffing tried restore 
last going continued 
weapons say 
secret invisibility must old 
guard possibility equipping ships 
reason patrol ships equipped already invisibility useless modern criminals know secret fight 
morey interrupted question 
arcot obvious get space meet enemy freedom movement 
going wondering could use wade system storing atomic hydrogen solution 
yields calories every two grams since method storing heat energy molecular motion director method converting heat mechanical work per cent efficiency use need really method storing heat energy use space 
arcot exhaled slowly answering watching column smoke vanish air 
thought trying think possible better cheaper quicker ways getting necessary power 
let eliminate known sources one one 
usual ones ones men using centuries go 
atomic hydrogen reaction stores energy per gram chemical reaction known 
things storage battery electro static condenser induction coil plain heat storage worthless us 
method storing energy know method used kaxorians driving huge planes 
use condensed light energy 
efficient ultimate maximum something method hope attain 
yet need huge reservoirs store 
result still ineffective purpose want something put small space want condense light still 
ideal form energy storage able release directly heat ray use utmost efficiency 
think absorb released energy usual cavity radiator 
queer little smile appeared arcot face 
remember want light condensed form form naturally stable need held bound state actually requires urging bring release energy 
example shout wade interrupted 
really rare whoo hand takes prizes laughed delightedly 
puzzled wonder morey two older men looked arcot grinning broadly 
well suppose must funny morey began hesitated 
oh see say good turned father 
see driving 
right noses time 
light matter windows found wrecked enemy ships contain enough bound light energy run planes could make next ten years going enemy supply us power get way 
decide arcot whether deserve prize ingenuity whether receive booby prizes stupidity 
arcot senior smiled first looked dubiously son 
definitely plenty right kind energy stored suggested energy need encouragement break free 
ideas couple 
know work course try 
arcot puffed pipe serious thought problems ahead 
wade interposed question 
suppose condense light energy first place sun dead whence light back atom suppose 
know much course sure must break matter energy 
condensation problem think possible solution key problem release 
lot know bigger store knowledge war anything added grimly 
possible man may lose knowledge life planets sun still plenty hope 
finished yet 
think got energy loose asked wade 
think big blocks appeared silver involved energy release yes 
blocks probably designed carry away power released 
release accomplished though know 
use material apparatus start release material energy material apparatus might catch fire 
disintegrating matter held apart matter 
quite impossible going get energy away method use fields force 
think method 
guess terrific current electricity would accomplish anything would 
going get current wires subject currents 
whatever matter involved currents apparatus except one case 
apparatus made kind matter affected 
solution obvious 
use light matter 
destroy light matter destroy electricity matter destroy electricity matter disturb light matter 
remember platform light metal clear crystal must insulating platform 
started assumptions case light metal carry 
said electricity metals carried electricity light metals would carry conduct light 
know substance transparent light carry electricity metallic conduction 
mean course substance transparent light time capable carrying electricity electronic transmission 
true things like nacl solutions ordinary h carry electricity ionic conduction 
even glass carry electricity well hot red hot glass carry enough electricity melt quickly 
glass solid viscous liquid carried ionic conduction 
iron copper sodium silver lead metals carry current means electron drift solid material 
cases see transparent substance conducts electricity 
similarly reverse true 
substance capable carrying electricity metallic conduction transparent 
opaque thickness 
course gold transparent leaf form thin conduct much peculiar condition reach case invisible ship different 
effects brought high frequency impressed 
get point 
remember wires saw leading little box reflecting material perfectly reflecting see 
saw must saw light reflected 
doubt light matter non metal non conductive light 
like sulphur electric non metal reflected base formed 
sulphur reflects base formed 
sulphur reflects electricity crystalline form passes light 
light non metal sort thing reflected light passed electricity 
conductor 
things need matter disintegrate matter hold disintegrating material 
two different types matter 
rest obvious decidedly easy 
done though war many machines drifting space waiting give secrets 
arcot senior clapped son back 
fair foundation start anyway 
think time got working problem since officially retired going downstairs 
know working lab method increase range power projector molecular motion field 
young norris helping really ideas 
show math later 
party broke three younger men staying labs older men leaving 
iv three immediately set work 
arcot suggestion wade morey attacked plate crystal attempt tear small piece might work 
arcot went televisophone room put second call tychos observatory great observatory recently established frigid surface moon 
huge mirror twenty feet diameter allowed immense magnification stellar observations greatly facilitated one bothered seeing always perfect 
however great distance rather handicap ordinary televisophone stations calls put astronomers made powerful sending station st louis interplanetary messages sent received side earth facing station constantinople city faced satellite 
stations could bridge distance readily clearly 
several minutes arcot waited connections made moon many minutes talked earnestly observer distant station last satisfied hung 
outlined ideas concerning black star based upon perturbation planets asked investigate possibilities see could find blotting stars lightless mass 
finally returned morey wade working crystal plate 
wade expression exasperation face morey grinning broadly 
hello arcot missed fun seen wade struggle plate plate absence twisted bent showing undergone terrific stresses 
wade began make series highly forceful comments properties plate language exactly scientific 
value though seemed relieve pent wrath 
wade seem like stuff 
maybe difficulty lies treatment rather material 
tried everything took coronium hack saw eat molybdenum steel like much cheese wore teeth 
tried diamond rotary saws attached electric motor wore diamonds 
got goat tried using little force 
put tension testing machine clamped clamp good pounds began bend quit 
morey held molecular beam tried twisting 
believe gave real pleasure see thing yield pressure 
brittle merely bends 
cut even get shavings darned thing 
said wanted make jolly balance determination specific gravity stuff dense need tiny scrap break loose wade looked plate thorough disgust 
arcot smiled sympathetically could understand feelings stuff certainly stubborn 
sorry warn fellows run anxious get call moon forgot tell expected make workable 
wade get another diamond tooth rotary saws get something may help 
put saw air motor 
use one made coronium 
wade looked rapidly disappearing arcot raised eyebrows scratching head turned arcot asked 
arcot returned five minutes small handling machine huge magnet 
must weighed nearly half ton 
quickly connected heavy duty power lines lab 
running handling machine position quickly hoisted bent twisted plate poles magnet aid derrick 
backing handling machine way returned briskly waiting associates 
see see confident smile arcot switched current big magnet 
terrific magnetic flux set light metal 
took little compressed air saw applied crystal plate 
smooth hiss air deepened harsh whine load came saw made contact refractory plate 
unbelievingly wade saw little diamond edge saw bite way slowly steadily plate 
moment cut little corner light matter fell heavy thud magnet pole drawn attraction magnet gravity 
shutting magnet arcot picked pair pliers gripped little fragment 
whew light metal certainly light metal bet little scrap weights ten pounds reduce considerably use 
difficult 
using magnet several large diamond faceplates able work tough material thin sheet heavy press cut small fragments determined specific gravity 
arcot wade asked finally magnet make stuff tractable physicist enough figure takes place inside material 
magnetism worked arcot explained light matter every photon affected magnetism every photon given new motion 
stuff made go speed light know 
solid could affected 
stuff able aid molecular motion beam make photons move parallel paths move full speed photon miles second 
tremendous speed individual photons makes material hard 
kinetic impulse rather considerable kinetic blow molecules metal give keeps metal penetrating 
simply gives powerful impulse even diamonds cut 
know iron saw cut platinum readily yet heated say degrees iron liquid platinum soft platinum cuts iron heat probably effect stuff action magnet individual photons corresponds effect heat individual atoms molecules 
mass softened work 
least way figure 
wade wish see determine density stuff 
used determinations type manipulation 
get may able show interesting results wade picked tiny chip light metal headed laboratory 
set jolly balance began work fragment 
results amazing checked rechecked work always answer 
finally returned main lab arcot morey busy construction large complicated electro static apparatus 
find called arcot saw wade reenter room 
hold report second give us hand laboratory scale apparatus type kaxorians used storage light 
known ever since began working machines would release energy normal violence certain changes made 
light condenser device stored photons close would also serve urge apart 
made necessary changes trying set apparatus work solid light matter 
developed gaseous material rather tricky thing change 
think almost got 
wade connect high frequency oscillator counterbalanced condenser 
may change oscillator frequency quite bit variable condenser 
results get wade shook head doubtfully 
know amazing stuff course must heavy still well anyway got density 
whewww 
lord almost five times heavy heaviest metal hitherto known 
half cubic foot material would mean pounds whole mass two tons 
wonder lift plate stopped work kaxorian apparatus discuss amazing results density test fell rapidly assembling device trained experimenter 
final details completed arcot stood back surveyed handiwork 
think enough urge cause disintegration right said want make sure set case think may well put big magnet place help work disintegration need 
last complete apparatus set tiny bit light matter work placed table powerful atchinson projector microscope field view exact center field magnet coil 
carefully step step arcot morey wade went work checking rechecking 
well ready said arcot finally placed projector screen position dimmed lights room 
touch switch projection screen illuminated greatly enlarged image tiny scrap light metal 
hand switch arcot spoke two 
say danger since done energy released blow top building 
reasonably sure work safely 
objections wade shook head morey said see flaws work 
arcot nodded unconsciously tensing closed switch 
put powerful arcot oscillator tubes action power ready application 
slowly closed rheostat put power coil 
little sliver metal slide seemed throb bit outline grew hazy last full power release slow imperceptible 
guess need magnet put time 
opened coil circuit closed magnet circuit half voltage increased current rheostat 
time plate throbbed quite violently took appearance bit iodine 
dense vapors began pouring instantly vapors became blindingly brilliant flood light 
arcot snapped open switch moment saw display start little time act instant circuit opened subsided 
even brief time light aluminum screen suddenly become limp slumped molten room unbearably hot men half blinded intensity light 
works yelled wade 
works sure hot roasting 
flung open window 
let air 
arcot morey gripped hands broad grin 
display meant earth venus would space ships fight space ships 
reason enough joy 
though made unusual amount progress already still great deal development work done 
fuller needed arcot decided called elder morey requested services could spared present work 
could would arrive later day 
fuller appeared mid afternoon found three friends already work development compact apparatus makeshift hookup used making first release mechanism 
see said arcot finished summary work point still quite job ahead us 
trying find data work tell need ship plenty strength plenty speed 
usual power plant course generators power tube board electro magnetic relays regular molecular motion controls 
addition must controls ray projector though must wait dad working method doubling range oh yes driving units inside ship power come energy light matter 
spent next hour discussing manifold details involved design space ship mechanism involved transferring light energy drivers means warming ship interstellar space main horizontal drive forward backward motion well braking three smaller vertical power units give freedom direction climb descent smaller horizontal power units turning moving sideways 
ships decided must capable six seven thousand miles second 
would need three types ships small single man speedster without bunk living quarters simply little power plant weapon 
designed speed mobility would hard hit offensive power would dangerous enemy 
would need fleet mother ships ships would hold speedsters pilots say thirty cruiser 
would also ten man scouts operating manner larger cruisers smaller fleet speedsters dependent 
defense arcot concluded depend armor heavy make still remain within bounds practical construction 
believe able build enough mass insulate negative catalysis ray 
depend mobility offense 
let get back work 
think fuller might call engineers big aircraft machine tool manufacturers fabricators ready start work plans finally drawn 
better get touch venerian producers 
new works sorthol kaxor certainly able help lot 
suppose interplanetary patrol men something say better called 
likewise venerian council 
morey maybe dad handle 
one arose set work respective tasks planning building earth venus war fleet 
v despite utmost endeavor hard work industrial might two worlds nearly six weeks fleet grown thing importance 
tests subjected tiny speedsters satisfactory 
behaved wonderfully shooting terrific speed acceleration pilot could stand 
speedsters literally piloted projectiles amazing mobility made powerful arm offense 
came special corp dubbed oddly enough rocket squad group men could stand plenty g 
rocket squad composed solely terrestrians accustomed gravity earth could stand greater acceleration strains could venerians 
pick air patrol formed nucleus new military organization short order great appeal new novel cream young men planet competing place among rocketeers 
ship speedster mother craft equipped invisibility locator sensitive short wave directional receiver would permit operator direct rays invisible targets 
ships could made invisible since depended principle absorption light energy 
walls every part ship perfectly transparent could absorb energy would still plainly visible even must remain visible could also force enemy remain visible 
ten man ship carried old fashioned cannon equipped hurl cannisters carrying luminous paint 
decided would advantages even invaders use invisibility space ship visible reflects emits light 
reason ships equipped portholes except pilot room observation posts 
light could escape 
reduce reflection absolute minimum ships painted absorptive black 
space would exceedingly difficult targets 
heating effect sun black pigment near great star rather disagreeably intense cool speedsters installed molecular director power units absorbed heat used energy drive ship 
heaters offset radiation loss black surface far sun 
speedsters equipped small machine gun shooting luminous paint bullets 
one landing another craft made visible least two hours since could cover area thirty feet decidedly effective 
found ray practice rather complicated 
government ranges set great mountain districts away valuable property soon found spatial warplay could carried earth 
rays quickly demolished targets short time made good progress toward demolishing mountains well 
problem solved using barren surface moon asteroid belt beyond mars proving ground 
ships sent squadrons fast could finished men could brought together trained 
establishing great shield ships across section system whence nigrans appeared hoped intercept next attack reached earth certain next attack would full force 
arcot gone conference held venus men investigated great wrecks scientist related view things offered suggestions 
arcot idea black star favorably received 
later told wade morey gone good reason objection idea 
though scientists willing admit invaders must come great distance agreed lived atmosphere hydrogen judging pale skins used rays sun still insisted theory outer planet sol 
remember explained arcot several years ago considerable discussion existence planet still sun pluto 
well known number irregularities orbits neptune pluto caused known planets outer planet could necessary mass orbit account 
attack outer space immediately taken proof theory easily supported 
one good point stood length time attacks fact ships developed year century chemical constitution men different 
new elements discovered except light matter rather wondering great difference earthly chemical constitution constitution invaders 
one argument enough throw mine though pointed odds thing happening 
know course planets formed results tidal action two passing suns 
imagine two mighty stars careening space drawing slowly nearer till last come within billion miles gigantic masses reach bind mighty chain gravity 
titanic masses swing trying pull free continue path center galactic system 
huge bulks come nearer chains bind become stronger stronger tremendous pull one gargantuan fire ball raises titanic tides flame 
great streamers gas shoot space lighted flaming suns 
pull gravity becomes intense one circles tide pulled mighty ball fire existence practically motionless far rotation goes begins acquire greater greater rotational speed tidal drag urges 
flames begin reach higher higher tides urged sun centrifugal force rise ever greater crest swinging suns struggle break loose flaming gas pulled becomes mighty column fire column reaches across three four dozen millions miles space joins two stars last stalactites stalagmites grow together 
flaming tie matter joins two titanic suns mighty rope fire binds far mightier chains gravity hold together 
original velocity reasserts spiraled say long year million years seems probable still instant life star begin draw apart flaming column stretched ever thinner grows two stars last separate 
gas never fall back sun 
like giant flaming cigar reaches space stay thus set rotation sun speed needed form orbit 
giant mass gas however cool continue develop energy matter surface sun cool 
cools still appear definite condensations beginnings planets 
great filament stretched sun sun cigar shaped matter plentiful toward center larger planets develop 
thus jupiter saturn far larger others 
two ends tapering thus earth larger venus larger mercury uranus neptune smaller saturn pluto smaller either 
mars asteroids hard explain 
perhaps easier understand remember planets thus formed must necessarily rotating eccentric orbits first born planets came near sun gaseous nearly mars lost much matter exists asteroids broke 
flaming star retired wandering space 
star left traces behind planets none existed 
remember must planets 
happened million years ago 
order might happen requires two stars pass within relatively short distance billion miles 
space overcrowded matter know 
density stars compared twenty tennis balls roaming mile sphere earth fills twenty tennis balls billion cubic miles space 
imagine two tennis balls plenty room wander passing within yards 
chances good chances two stars passing close enough make planets 
let us consider another possibility 
black star told planets 
means must thus passed close another star 
coming close another sun similarly afflicted 
chances happening inconceivably small 
one chance billions planets form 
two stars must pass close space wander 
afflicted stars separate one passes close new star thus similarly afflicted one chance billions well chance billions billions 
theory called impossible 
know 
besides thought argument men throw 
surprised explanation strange chemical constitution men solar system planet would impossible 
quite possible live planet revolving sun nevertheless planet another star 
quite conceivable chemical constitution neptune pluto found quite different rest planets 
two filaments drawn suns may mingled though think quite conceivable parting sun tore one planet even two three star 
would explain strange beings 
ideas accepted

arcot puffed pipe meditatively several moments stood stretched 
ho wish let go active duty space fleet scientific reputation awful handicap times grinned 
rejected emphatically tried enlist 
interplanetary governments stated flatly important scientist risked pilot space ship 
two worlds great construction plants humming activity 
civilian production barest essentials put aside duration emergency 
space ships turned top speed getting fuel wrecks invaders cruisers 
ship needed small amount light metal energy content tremendous

already fleet speedsters mother ships space every passing hour others left home planets always adding fighting force engage attackers deep space stray ships might filter destroy cities earth venus 
assembly lines turning ships rapidly training operators serious problem 
difficulty finally overcome abbreviated training course actual manipulation controls home planets subsequent training squadrons raced outward courses 
soon decided must another service beside ordinary ships 
one plant devoted making huge interstellar liners 
giants made venus nearly quarter mile long though diminutive comparison giant nigran ships still decidedly large 
twelve could completed within next month found one immediately set aside officers headquarters ship 
recognized officers must within hundred thousand miles actual engagements decisions would made without much loss time transmission reports 
ship must brought near front lest officers endangered entire engagement lost want organizing central headquarters 
final solution huge central control ship 
large vessels used carry food supplies 
enter engagement huge size would make vulnerable tiny darting mites space nigran ships interplanetary patrol 
little ships could conveniently stock week engagement drop back warehouses space go forward action 
throughout long wait officers solarian forces organized forces limit ability planning move attack

short later remain dark planet saw first monsters space rise slowly ground leap swiftly forward methodically though released automatic machinery others leaped swift pursuit rushing across half world tremendous space lock would let void 
long swift column rushed 
one time passed mighty sea space 
space quickly formed set 
though magic far left flight suddenly appeared similar flight giant ships right another seemed leap nothingness ships planets came sight 
quickly formed vast cone leader ship protecting screen yet powerful offensive formation 
endlessly seemed sped darkness 
yellow star flamed brighter brighter slowed ships till small fliers could safely released space 
like swarm insects flying giant birds space little ships circled mighty masses battle cruisers 
huge combined mass fleet rested sufficient gravitational attraction force little fliers form orbits 
sped void vast conical fleet slowly circling belt little ships 
fleet whose counterpart never entered solar system 
well beyond orbit pluto first solarian scouts detected approaching invasion fleet 
tension gripped earth venus guardian ships long time suddenly snapped like great machine set sudden motion huge boulder balanced given last push sends spinning destructive violence slope fleet went action 
merely little scout ten man cruiser sent message attack upon receiving headquarters permission went action 
tacticians wanted try get entire fleet battle range surprise attack power others felt could possibly succeed 
important decided opportunity learning invaders new weapons 
nigrans warning ten man cruiser invisible though vast bulk ships stood plainly lighted blazing sun 
need make sun stand still battle finished change time first intimation attack nigrans sudden splitting destruction leading ship 
could realize happening thirty five destructive molecular motion beams tearing space meet little ten man cruiser flight speedsters action twenty one great ships crumpled burst noiselessly void gases belching space great shining halo light sun light struck 
unable see tiny enemies striking swiftly desperately possible knowing death practically certain hoping destroy equal number giants played beams death taking care miss ships much possible 
another ship silently crumpled suddenly one cruiser right line flight brought sudden halt molecules reversed 
ships behind unable stop suddenly piled chaotic wreckage vast halo shining gas spread fifty thousand miles blinding ships radiance making impossible see tiny enemies 
solarian ships coming swiftly attack 
suddenly combination three ten man cruisers stopped another great ships instantaneously 
another soundless crash giant mass wreckage heaped suddenly glowed dully red energy impact 
little ships invaders got action 
delayed desperate attempts dreadnaughts wipe enemies death rays could cover great distances without delay 
battle spreads ten thousand mile cube space thousand billion cubic miles space impossible cover instantaneously machine 
already nearly hundred fifty giant liners gone making colossal mass junk space 
must protect remaining cruisers flight small ships protect 
many solarians went death rays 
death rays exceedingly effective heat rays able get quite long range easily detected invisibility locators meant certain destruction molecular motion ray would moments located 
main fleet solar system already way every moment drew closer running battle great ships nigrans although entering system cautiously going high speed interplanetary speeds measured 
entire battle running encounter two forces 
solarian force invisible small size certainly getting better encounter thus far odds changing small ships come fray engaging close range easy time 
would many hours full strength solarian fleet could brought bear enemy 
able retire await arrival must delay nigran fleet 
even one great ships safely reach two planets behind within half hour original signal rocket squad thrown battle fervor abandon given famous division name last forever 
small fliers nigrans beginning take appalling toll thinning ranks solarians 
coming rocket squad welcome indeed able maneuver swiftly enemy speedsters harder spot solarian ten man thirty man boats 
solarian speedsters even smaller comparable nigran craft tremendous amount damage 
heat ray quite ineffective ten man ships even working full capacity produced small generators nigran one man boats 
cruisers could absorb heat turn power faster enemy could supply 
beams monster interstellar liners another matter course 
one man speedsters truly deadly plan attack liners 
plan officially frowned upon great risks pilots must take 
directed boats one monster ships power units full drive 
close target possible man jumped ship clothed course altitude suit equipped radio transmitter receiver 
death rays could stop speedsters momentum invaders could make less deadly heat beam molten still effective 
projectile weighing twenty two tons moving hundred miles second destroy anything man lift planet speed made impossible dodge usually found mark 
risk solarian forces victorious pilots could picked later provided long time elapsed midst battle solarians began wonder nigran fleet decreasing rapidly certainly caused damage suddenly found answer 
one ships another another fell victim pale red ray showed like ghostly pillar luminosity coming nowhere going nowhere answer invaders ships becoming invisible invisibility detectors overloaded hunt hard nigrans slipping past silently destroying solarian ships molecular motion rays quite effective invisible ship found 
destroying nigrans rapidly destroyed letting slip past luminous paint bombs bullets called play 
enemy ships shot missiles invisibility forestalled 
long last dark bulk main fleet approached scarcely visible cloud tiny darting metal ships 
battle far preliminary engagement 
huge ships nigrans forced stop attack releasing last fliers retire distance protected screen small ships helpless solarian speedsters 
invisibility fell disfavor plenty solarian ships nigrans conspicuous invisible visible 
radio detector could pick 
entire nigran fleet beginning reveal disorder uncertainty arose desperation cornered undesirable position possible 
outside solarian fleet ships lighted glare sun 
defenders hand position enemy could see night side shadowed side air diffuse light exceedingly hard find 
bargain radium paint making life nigrans brief flitting thing invaders began pay awful toll first real engagement 
lacked necessary power cover entire solarian fleet death rays heat weapons little help 
power small ships count much big liners could use weapons effectively small fliers must adversary 
despite however nigrans greatly outnumbered earth venus forces looked though long costly war lay ahead 
last solarian generals tried ruse ruse hoped would work beings never plan war space sure opponents experience art 
true nigrans revealed especially striking generalship fact committed inexcusable blunders sure 
though know solarians advantage thousands years planetary warfare rely 
stood good stead 
nigrans rallying rapidly 
surprise forces solarians dwindling matter desperately remnant fought could hold back entire force nigran fliers 
last appeared certain small ships could completely engage solarian fleet quickly giant cruisers formed great dense cone attack given signal fliers cleared hole great disc shaped shield defenders 
rays fanned overlap ahead nigran fleet plunged disc ships close four hundred miles per second 
broke way unprotected planets solarian ships closed gap behind eighteen giant ships burst wreckage powerful beams found part remnant defending forces far busy fliers attack large ships 
monster engines destruction raced toward planets still approximately two billion miles away knew far behind fliers engaging solarians 
left guard guard keeping enemy occupied free drive nowhere came counterattack nearly five thousand thirty man ships earth venus invisible darkness space suddenly leaped action dreadnoughts sped past 
destroying rays played nigh helpless giants huge ships crumbling colossal derelicts 
last guard stripped fell easy prey attackers 
faster could keep count losing warships space ruse worked perfectly nearly ten man one man ships left behind original disc thirty man light cruisers hundred ten man one man crafts sped away form great ring twenty thousand miles farther back 
nigran fleet flown blindly ambush 
one thing left 
defeated 
must return far black star leave solarians possession worlds 
battle purposes great force nearly wiped fliers remained force could longer carried remnant great liners 
swiftly fell back passing disc losing thirty vessels raced swiftly away fleet enemies 
solarians however content 
ships forming giant hollow cylinder sphere nigrans retreated beams playing behind cylinder moved forward surrounded raced together toward distant lightless sun 
solar end cylinder swiftly closed blocked group huge ships taken visible part battle 
nigrans stopped using rays solarians followed armed readiness molesting long molested 
many days strange flight lasted till last great yellow sun sol faded distance unusually brilliant star 
suddenly visible darkness strange black world loomed ahead nigran ships settled swiftly toward 
airlocks great liners settled planet 
action taken long solarian ships menaced eight long months darting ships hung four englobed worlds nigra 
last astronomers earth venus sent billions miles ether message safety 
guard could return home sun guarding would soon far earth venus make attack logical 
despite years come fleet would guard rim system sure appeared suns passed never meet 
strange thing happened passing stars 
pluto longer circled sol captured nigra great fleet returned changed solar system 
sol still center ten planets including two new ones sun captured nigra return pluto planets shifted bit orbits 
ultimate effect planets say yet 
change thus far certainly great though somewhat warmer climate exists earth bit cooler venus 
long range difference however exceedingly interesting 
solar system passed experience probably unique history mighty nebula sun infinitesimal part 
chances one star surrounded system planets pass within hundred billion miles another star similarly accompanied one billions billions 
systems inhabited intelligent races easy understand scientists could believe arcot theory attack another sun actually seen worlds 
war two solar systems learned much lost much 
yet probability gained lost two new old planets mean tremendous things us 
already scientists work vast museums ancient laboratories every day new things discovered 
lost many men saved worlds learned many invaluable secrets invaders 
addition scratched surface science least thousand million years old epilogue taj lamor looked across void space toward fading point yellow light 
far distance glowed every second moved many miles farther 
lost struggle life new sun thought turned back defeated distant sun 
time brought new hope 
lost many men struggle dwindling resources strained limit hope new spirit born race 
fought lost gained spirit adventure dormant millions years 
great dim mass city knew many laboratories full swing active work 
knowledge application discovered rediscovered 
new uses found old things daily life changing 
race awake rejuvenated change great sea yellow fire strange sun faded behind fleeing ships leaving dead planets still circling dead sun thought last chance gone forever 
hope reawakened birth new ideas new ways things 
tordos gar right lost losing taj lamor shifted gaze blazing point light titanic sea flame burning brilliance power despite greater distance made remote yellow sun seem pale dim 
blue white glow told monster star star far brighter one left 
become brightest star heavens 
ancient star charts listed red giant named tongsil e meant fifth magnitude distant 
long ages passed since classified become mighty sun star prime 
reach eight one half light years away search force would swing world orbit last successful 
knowledge come late aid fight yellow sun might yet use might even tear planets orbits drive free bodies across void 
would take ages make trip long ages already passed dark planet swung void 
difference would make accompanied dead star true star goal double star planets could find orbits might remedy could tear one star free hurl space making remaining sun suitable use 
would escape dead sun
