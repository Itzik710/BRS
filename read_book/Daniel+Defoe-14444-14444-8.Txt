two things may properly called trading young beginner tradesmen often overthrown 

trading beyond stock 

giving large credit 
tradesman ought consider measure well extent strengh stock money credit properly beginning credit stock well money 
takes much credit really much danger gives much credit danger lies particularly tradesman buys buys faster sell buying upon credit payments perhaps become due soon goods sold must answer bills upon strength proper stock pay cash hold obliged put bills due suffer impertinence dunned creditor perhaps servants apprentices usual indecencies kind people 
impairs credit comes deal merchant clothier tradesman treated like one indifferent paymaster though may give credit yet depending bargains six months take eight nine payment consider price use accordingly impairs gain loss credit indeed loss money weakens ways 
tradesman therefore especially beginning ought wary taking much credit much better slip occasion buying bargain advantage usually temptation buying greater quantity goods pay run debt insulted last ruined 
merchants wholesale dealers put goods apt prompt young shopkeepers young tradesmen buy great quantities goods take large credit first snare many young beginner fallen ruined bud young beginner find vent quantity undone time payment merchant expects money whether goods sold pay gone 
tradesman buys warily always pays surely every young beginner ought buy cautiously money pay need never fear goods merchants warehouses always open may supply upon occasions wants customers call 
may pass kind objection goods tradesman may deal bought markets fairs say chiefly bought cheesemongers buy stocks cheese butter cheese several fairs warwickshire atherston fair particular fair gloucestershire sturbridge fair near cambridge butter ipswich fair suffolk many things answer plain things generally bought thus ready money goods tradesman sure rule buying namely cash 
speaking taking credit must necessarily supposed speak goods bought upon credit linen draper buys hamburgh dutch merchants woollen draper blackwell hall men haberdasher thread merchants mercer weavers italian merchants silk man turkey merchants like necessity running deep debt may buy sparingly recruit sell 
know tradesmen fond seeing shops well stocked warehouses full goods snare brings buy goods want great error either judgment vanity except retailers shops trades must great choice goods else may want trade otherwise well experienced tradesman rather see warehouse empty full empty fill pleases credit good cash strong thronged warehouse sign want customers bad market whereas empty warehouse sign nimble demand 
let young tradesman value upon great throng goods hand necessary supply produce choice new fashionable goods nay though mercer necessity large stock goods say supposing even mercer tolerable show choice fashionable goods gives shop reputation derives credit throng old shopkeepers call namely fashion things trades much needful caution goods quick sale beauty tradesman warehouse shop either wisdom keep posture payments may come front fast go rear may able answer demands merchants dealers possible let man come twice money 
reason plain leads back began credit stock well supported good stock durable 
tradesman whose credit good untouched unspotted maintained care shall many cases buy goods cheap three four months time payment another man shall ready money say cases goods ordinarily sold time manufactures bay trade excepted generally 
keeps credit unshaken double stock mean addition real stock often superior nay known several considerable tradesmen city traded great success considerable degree yet bottom one shilling real stock strength reputation sober diligent care preserved character honest men credit business cautious dealing punctual payments gone till gain trade effectually established raised estates nothing 
return dark side namely trading second danger giving much credit 
takes credit may give credit must exceedingly watchful dangerous state life tradesman live much jeopardy seaman upon lee shore 
people trusts fail fail punctual compliance never support credit unless caution giving sure give much credit takes 
word much must understood thus either must sell shorter time takes less quantity last safest namely sure trust much trusted 
real stock indeed besides credit takes indeed makes case differ man pay debts whether people pay man question past danger hurt trusts beyond extent stock credit even may overthrown 
many sad examples time late war days public credit precarious condition since say sad examples namely tradesmen flourishing circumstances indeed good estates bottom full credit trusted public great sums coming time expected either deficiency funds given parliament parliament soon making good deficiencies disasters times say money coming answer demands ruined least credit wounded quite undone yet paid could paid debts good sums money left 
others ability afford obliged sell tallies orders forty fifty per cent 
loss whence proceeded black trade buying selling navy victualling bills transport debts brokers usurers got estates many thousands tradesmen brought nothing even stood lost great sums money selling tallies credit bought dear throwing away one half save much better sinking burden like sailors storm lighten ship wallowing trough sea throw choicest goods overboard even half cargo order keep ship water save lives 
terrible examples trading indeed men tempted high price government gave goods obliged give badness public credit time sufficient make good loss sustained sale tallies even sold able stand without ruin yet great sufferers enough keep credit 
effect giving much credit though government trusted yet neither could government keep sinking credit indebted indeed able support credit way 
return young tradesman speaking 
greatest prudence therefore considered fund stock rest upon say next business take care credit next limiting buying liberty let sure limit selling 
could tradesman buy upon credit sell ready money might turn usurer put stock interest buy land would occasion one shilling since expected done business act prudence parts mean taking giving credit best rule given never give much credit takes least one third part 
giving credit mean even goods buys upon credit may sold upon credit perhaps goods usually sold otherwise alternative thus either must give much credit quantity goods long credit relation time example suppose young tradesman buys ten thousand pounds value goods credit ten thousand pounds sold eleven thousand pounds likewise credit time given man state apparent destruction hundred one blown perhaps owes ten thousand pounds twenty men perhaps eleven thousand pounds owing two hundred men scarce possible two hundred petty customers punctually comply payments enable comply two three thousand pounds fall short poor tradesman unless fund support deficiency must undone 
man bought ten thousand pounds six eight months credit sold two hundred customers three months four months credit might supposed greatest part would paid time enough make payments good would lost still 
hand suppose sold three thousand pounds worth ten ready money sold rest six months credit might supposed three thousand pounds cash else two hundred debtors might pay time might stop months tradesman creditors till difference might made good 
easy thing tradesman lose credit trade hard upon blow retrieve 
need tradesman guard running far debt letting people run far debt pay pay others next thing commission bankrupt tradesman may undone though eleven thousand pounds pay ten true possible country infinite extent trade see managed kingdom either one hand another carried without reciprocal credit taken given nice article opinion many tradesmen break giving much credit break taking 
danger indeed mutual great 
whatever young tradesman omits let guard giving taking much credit 
divers ways trading besides taking giving much credit one running projects heavy undertakings either common road tradesman already engaged grasping many undertakings vulgarly expressed many irons fire time cases tradesman often wounded deeply sometimes deep recover 
consequences adventures generally first stock starve tradesman impoverish ordinary business main support family lessen strength trade lessened yet stock lessened rarely add credit lessen man stock weaken main must last faint 
secondly lessen stock draw sensible part wound tenderest nervous part always draw away ready money follows money sinews business life trade maintained shop kept credit full extent drawn like blood let veins trade languishes credit degrees flags goes tradesman falls weight 
thus seen many flourishing tradesman sensibly decay credit first little suffered want credit trade declined say obliged trade less less till last wasted reduced wise enough wary enough draw betimes avoid breaking yet come trade like old invalid soldier wars maimed bruised sick reduced fitter hospital shop miserable havoc launching projects remote undertakings made among tradesmen 
safe tradesman avoiding remote excursions keeps close within verge affairs minds shop warehouse confining belongs goes road business without launching unknown oceans content gain trade neither led ambition avarice neither covets greater richer uncertain hazardous attempts

instead following advice defoe therefore young tradesman recommended keep sufficient stock every kind goods professes deal 
shopkeeper hardly commit greater blunder allow article trade 
one chief duties ought consist keeping fresh stock every article chance sought avoiding imprudence keeping large stock goods comes nearest defoe meaning certain hand abundant choice shop gains name best chance securing concourse customers
