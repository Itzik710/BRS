stage power united arts actors missionaries 
art science capable producing strong certain effect soul man stage good reason actor medium quality enjoys greater popularity greatest savant artist 
sort public service could provide enjoyment gratification theater 
one fine day katya joined troupe actors went believe ufa taking away good supply money store rainbow hopes aristocratic views work 
first letters journey marvellous 
read simply amazed small sheets paper could contain much youth purity spirit holy innocence time subtle apt judgments would done credit fine mas culine intellect 
like rapturous paean praise sent mere description volga country towns visited companions failures successes every sentence fragrant confiding trustfulness accustomed read face time great many grammatical mistakes scarcely punctuation 
six months passed received highly poetical enthusiastic letter beginning words come love letter accompanied photograph representing young man shaven face wide brimmed hat plaid flung shoulder 
letters followed splendid commas stops made appearance grammatical mistakes disappeared distinctly masculine flavor 
katya began writing splendid would build great theater somewhere volga cooperative system attract enterprise rich merchants steamer owners would great deal money would vast audiences actors would play co operative terms possibly really excellent seemed schemes could originate man mind 
however may year half everything seemed go well katya love believed work happy began notice letters unmistakable signs falling 
began katya complaining companions first ominous symptom young scientific literary man begins career bitter complaints scientific literary men sure sign worn fit work 
katya wrote companions attend rehearsals never knew parts one could see every one utter disrespect public production absurd plays behavior stage benefit actors fund talked actresses serious drama demeaned singing chansonettes tragic actors sang comic songs making fun deceived husbands pregnant condition unfaithful wives 
fact amazing yet ruined provincial stage could still maintain rotten unsubstantial footing 
answer wrote katya long must confess boring letter 
among things wrote happened converse old actors worthy men showed friendly disposition towards conversations could understand work controlled much intelligence free choice fashion mood public 
best play day tragedy operetta parisian farces extravaganzas always seemed equally sure right path use 
see cause evil must sought actors deeply art attitude whole society 
letter mine irritated katya 
answered singing parts different operas 
wrote worthy men showed friendly disposition band knaves nothing worthy 
horde savages got stage simply one would taken elsewhere call artists simply impudent 
numbers dull witted creatures drunkards intriguing schemers slanderers one person talent among 
tell bitter art love fallen hands people detest bitter best men look evil afar caring come closer instead intervening write ponderous commonplaces utterly useless sermons style
