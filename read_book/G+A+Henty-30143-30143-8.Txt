farm work amusements 
although two months elapsed since ground ploughed planted progress made crop maize pumpkins surprising former especially nearly six feet high 
rapid growth result extreme fertility virgin soil aided late abundant supply water heat sun 
maize given great deal six inches high thinned plants nine ten inches apart 
done united strength party mr hardy boys working two hours morning much evening 
girls also assisted peons worked whole day except eleven three heat great even 
many hands make light work consequence whole ground maize cultivation thinned little week 
latterly maize grown fast boys declared could almost see grow end two months sowing flower 
maize indian corn strongly resembles water rushes appearance feathery blossom also resembles rush 
indian corn forms main article food south america northern states north america 
equally useful common india tropical countries

first introduced europe east great family polenta ruled important town ravenna nearly two hundred years 
ground maize still called polenta throughout italy great family live name useful cereal introduced memory warlike deeds lost except learned 
one evening mr hardy wife children strolling cool evening look pleasure upon bright green healthy valuable crops hubert said indian corn papa great yellow heads covered grain like beads one sees corn dealers shops england yes hubert 
well make long delicate stems bear weight 
bend like corn every puff wind 
seem possible could bear quarter weight heavy yellow heads 
could hubert nature made wise extraordinary provision difficulty 
plants trees acquainted fruits seeds blossom grew 
maize placed entirely different part plant 
short time see indeed may see plants stalk begin thicken foot eighteen inches ground little time burst head maize enveloped leaves looks mere bunch come forth 
time grow larger larger plant wither die place head springs 
part remains dry field appears covered dead stumps bunches dead leaves top 
ready harvest 
strange plant papa quite long time heads come 
going plant upon bit land got ready sowing six acres 
mean plant cotton hubert 
sent buenos ayres seeds called carolina upland expect days 
takes great deal labor papa calculation northern states hubert one man cultivate eight acres cotton assisted wife children certain periods labor always required family cultivate another eight ten acres produce half peon labor required hoeing picking time help 
machinery required separate seeds cotton charley asked 
absolutely necessary charley although course economical cultivation carried upon large scale 
variety going try sometimes called bowed carolina used cleaned placing upon number strings stretched tight struck sort bow vibration caused seed separate cotton 
drawing one contrivances book house time comes boys shall make one 
work us indoors weather hot 
course find succeeds pays well shall take hands get proper machinery extend cultivation 
intend plant rows rather wide apart use light plough ridge boards instead hoeing save labor 
much cotton get acre mrs hardy asked 
southern states expect twelve hundred pounds upon new ground twelve hundred pounds pods make three hundred cleaned cotton 
got cotton fairly ground mean plant acre two tobacco quantity sugar cane experiment 
must make garden house really urgent need 
grow rice papa doubt could hubert mean try 
succeed rice keep ground grew state swamp would unhealthy 
irrigate fields oftener absolutely necessary 
anything approaching swampy even wet lands climate like would almost certain breed malaria 
besides eaten alive mosquitoes 
shall certainly try rice 
tropical productions shall day give trial 
ginger vanilla things would doubt flourish 
believe would give extraordinary rate profit though land cheap labor scarce 
still would interesting would cause little variety amusement work always important point doubt would generally profit though occasionally may make total failure 
often daybreak girls would go brothers river watch waterfowl surface amusing dabbled played water unsuspicious danger 
favorites though beautiful scarlet flamingoes slender legs long graceful necks whose great employment seemed stand quiet water two three inches deep preen glossy red feathers 
girls wished could get waterfowl especially flamingoes tame order might swim dam pond come fed boys several talks practicable way capturing 
last thought making sort enclosure light boughs entrance birds could easily pass could easily return scatter grain enclosure entice birds enter 
explaining plan mr hardy said doubt would succeed capturing birds caught would impossible tame full grown wild fowl plan find nests take eggs young birds 
determined bushes close river thick permit examination shore started one morning early going river entered waded along considerable distance 
discovered two swans nests several different descriptions ducks 
birds sitting upon eggs others young brood hatched scuttled away bushes parent birds upon disturbed 
charley hubert made remark breakfast upon success expedition charley went two days rosario procured mr percy kept quantity chickens two sitting hens 
placed nests bullock cart hamper mrs hardy idea purpose put quite pleased arrival mount pleasant addition stock 
indeed long agreed would keep hens soon maize ripe 
next morning boys went brought back twenty eggs various kinds wild duck including four swans eggs obtain shoot parent birds furnished larder days placed hens place eggs took girls triumph see commencement tame duck project 
little girls delighted immense amusement go constantly see eggs hatched course one could tell long sat upon previous taken 
remarked four eggs much larger others idea swans 
course days six young ducklings hatched hens unhappy difficulty continuing sit care young ones mind one hen little ones removed distance nest whole eggs put remaining hen 
four swans five ducks safely hatched hen refused sit longer remaining eggs lost 
swans safely hatched boys told sisters really delight extreme 
days taken dam soon found way water great distress foster mother obliged stand upon bank calling vain till little ones chose come ashore 
hencoop soon knocked together old box placed near dam ere long hens became accustomed fancy charges water would walk picking insects little ones swam pond 
twice day girls went feed grain bits boiled pumpkin pumpkins soon began come bearing ducklings cygnets last present little larger others would swim rapidly towards saw would feed greedily hands 
weeks later desire young flamingoes gratified 
boys ride coming upon river wide flat sandy banks round timber grew determined tie horses enter stream see could get eggs 
difficulty made way bushes getting water waded along turn river brought sight flat bank 
twenty thirty flamingoes upon birds gregarious 
standing water usual boys could make others 
flat shore several heaps earth across birds apparently sitting one leg straddling side 
comical aspect boys burst laugh scared flamingoes took flight instantly 
boys waded spot got ashore see strange heaps 
great delight found nests upon top several eight nine eggs carefully arranged 
legs flamingo long bird unable double sit upon nest usual fashion 
hen bird therefore scrapes together pile earth top lays eggs places astride keep warm 
boys argument whether take away two nests entire whether take eggs nest decided upon former plan order young broods might hatched simultaneously 
upon boys reaching home treasure sisters delight unbounded hens soon placed upon new charges good sitters took without much difficulty 
young broods hatched girls greatly disappointed appearance little greyish fluffy balls instead lovely red things expected means consoled father told would three four years gained beautiful color 
however became great pets droll long legs slender necks great curved bills

occasionally one boys went rosario cart mr hardy bought hundreds young fruit trees apple pear plum apricot peach planted garden sides rear house others open beyond round light fence one wire put keep cattle trespassing 
clumps young palms bananas tropical trees shrubs also planted future adornment place 
fences erected round cultivated ground enclosure made cattle driven night 
fences easily cheaply made

wood grows abundantly upon upper river cut floated great rafts rosario 
tough wood splits readily therefore admirably suited posts

hen house quickly built mere framework covered felt bats across fowls perch upon

next time cart went rosario brought back fifty fowls cost dollars 
henceforth eggs omelettes became regular part breakfast puddings notably improved 
chickens gave little trouble foraged finding abundance insects everywhere getting addition pots indian corn every morning 
maud ethel took turns week take charge hen house great pleasure watch numerous broods young chickens hunt eggs spite nests temptingly prepared hens would frequently persist laying nests long grass 
hens however numerous foe great trouble young mistresses 
skunks animal weasel tribe much resembling squirrels appearance possessing abominable smell much dogs would attack almost anything would run away

mr hardy pumpkins began ripen bought six pigs 
little trouble although sty built allowed wander pleased day another wire added fence round cultivated land keep trespassing 
crop pumpkins enormous mr hardy determined pigs killed eighteen months time animals increase rapidly would quite large herd 
although immense deal hard work got four months followed completion house arrival mrs hardy daughters must supposed mingled plenty relaxation amusement 
days one boys go gun hour either sunrise sunset seldom failing bring home wild fowl two kind 
sometimes afternoon would go ride sisters chase ostrich run gray foxes abounded destructive among young lambs 
twice rides boys brought puma bay always carried ball one barrels revolvers soon despatched unwelcome visitors 
contrived apparatus straps sort little pocket muzzle gun went hung saddle front leg stock gun secured strap pommel saddle side revolver holster 
inconvenient way carrying gun respects strap unfastened get chance shot thereby lost considered preferable mode first adopted riding guns slung behind

riding quietly upon lookout game carried gun readiness upon arms 
one rides hubert brought bullet swan making bed river maud said tea wish could shoot would great amusement enjoy rides good deal knew could take shot case lion deer came

neighbourly visits advice 
must supposed hardys whole time leading perfectly solitary life 
upon contrary great deal sociable companionship 
within range ten miles less four estancias owned englishmen besides first friend mr percy

gentlemen ridden call upon new comers within days mr hardy first arrival offered help power 
hardys much pleased visitors young men frank hearty manner natural men free restraints civilised life 
visits returned short time communication distant visitors ceased hardys busy spare time upon distant rides 
one party canterbury three englishmen called estancia frequently dropped talk mr hardy boys often rode work done 
canterbury also young settlement four five months indeed older mount pleasant owners like hands full work sometimes knew hardys particularly hard work one two would come daybreak give assistance 
final week work especially mrs hardy arrival three came lent aid jamiesons 
soon mrs hardy arrived neighbors came call friendly intercourse quickly established 
spare bed room mount pleasant hammocks made hooks put sitting room walls hammocks could slung night taken morning 
english party always rode back canterbury distance short jamiesons generally messrs percy williams markham usually came afternoon rode back next morning 
press work boys sisters often cantered canterbury tea sometimes seldom jamiesons estancia 
light hearted young englishmen naturally fancy quiet thoughtful scotchmen 
latter however greatly esteemed mr mrs hardy perceived fund quiet good sense earnestness 
upon sunday morning mr hardy service whole friends generally came 
held early jamiesons englishmen could ride back homes heat day three remaining dine returning cool evening 
canterbury entirely sheep cattle farm 
owners five thousand sheep hundreds cattle comparatively good deal time upon hands stock sheep farming require much personal care supervision must bestowed upon agricultural farms 
jamiesons contrary entirely occupied tillage sheep head cattle 
mr hardy remarking upon one day mr percy replied ah poor fellows unfortunate 
brought fair capital large stock sheep cattle canterbury party 
six months however arrived yes year indians swept upon carried every animal 
attacked house jamiesons defended well indians anxious get booty beat retreat 
pursuit hopeless every horse driven walk six miles next hacienda give news long party could got together indians beyond possibility pursuit 
two three hundred sheep dozen two bullocks found way back land remained jamiesons capital invested stock 
however looked affairs manfully face sold animals bought couple ploughs draught bullocks hired peon two set work 
get slowly time doubt well course years 
men pluck perseverance certain get 
puts mind hardy matter upon intended speak 
getting time year indian attacks likely take place 
sometimes quiet year two troublesome 
five six years ago first came terrible times 
vast numbers cattle driven sheep less seldom take travel fast drive sometimes 
good many shepherds killed two three estancias captured burnt inmates murdered 
farthest settler consequently exposed 
estancia strong well built well armed good shots 
think respect safe except sudden surprise 
dogs sure give alarm still sleep everything readiness 
thank percy shall take advice 
expected heard bought place hearing nothing indians time almost forgotten 
prepare defense without loss day 
house one vulnerable point doors shutters 
measure afternoon get take letter forward rosario first opportunity sheets thin iron cover

said conveyance sent two days time would readiness place 
conversation caused mr hardy great uneasiness 
possibility quite prepared could feel danger really hand without anxious feeling 
thousand sheep cost cattle much 
lambing season come gone flock sheep doubled number 
cattle greatly increased sheep nearly ready shearing 
altogether value stock 
loss would absolute ruin still original capital bank buenos ayres would serious loss 
mr hardy alone mr percy conversation took place determined take boys entire confidence

girls great scare first time came upon iguana thinking crocodile 
great lizards five feet long ferocious looking harmless unless attacked 
defend inflict sharp blow tails severe bite teeth 
common indians eat say meat excellent young hardys could never persuaded taste 
thus matters proceeded time without noteworthy incident 
circle acquaintances grew little little 
several neighbouring plots taken although new settlers little time making visits still fact presence near gave feeling companionship security 
frequently young men would arrive letters introduction would stay days inspected country 
household received increase 
young englishman named fitzgerald son old friend hardys written expressing strong desire come asking advice matter 
several letters exchanged length mr fitzgerald earnest request mr hardy agreed receive son year learn business pampas farmer embarked upon account 
small room accordingly cleared mr hardy never reason regret received 
pleasant light hearted young fellow twenty years age 
one change however taken place deserves mention 
sarah one day came mistress much blushing hesitation said terence kelly asked marry 
mrs hardy long suspected attachment sprung irishman servant smiled said well sarah say terence year agreed stop us liberty like know 
oh want leave 
told terence 
master mistress willing shall marry stay say terence say would take married servant terence must stay 
objection sarah think answer mr hardy none 
terence good steady fellow know mr hardy high opinion could make marriage would please us 
sorry lose could case opposed marrying liked shall satisfaction keeping us 
settled fortnight afterwards terence sarah two days holiday went buenos ayres english church came back man wife 
went back work usual change terence took meals lived house instead men huts 
time begun find crops peculiar warm countries would pay would rather paid less suitable 
cotton crop proved success field time covered cotton plants burst first bright yellow blossom covered many balls white fluff 
picking cotton looked upon first great fun although proved hard work finished 
weight rather exceeded mr hardy anticipation 
process cleaning cotton pods seeds proved long troublesome operation taken immense time 
judging progress first made really began despair ever finishing practice became adroit 
still found great labor heat day although carried within doors 
dirty work light particles fluff got everywhere end couple hours work party looked like family bakers 
indeed quarter quantity raised cleaned heartily sick job remainder sold pod englishman brought machinery attempting raise cotton near buenos ayres 
although profits considerable unanimously determined experiment repeated rate present 
mr hardy first carried idea planting couple acres tobacco sugar cane ground required purposes 
however abandoned idea two months marriage terence sarah planted tobacco upon return buenos ayres ready picked 
culture tobacco requires considerable care 
ground first prepared great care well thoroughly manured required present case rich virgin soil needed artificial aid 
dug beds something like asparagus beds two feet wide deep trench 
seeds raised seed bed nine ten inches high taken carefully transplanted beds two rows placed plants foot apart 
various methods cultivation one adopted mr hardy 
plants grew rapidly ground occasionally hoed kept free weeds 
four feet high tops nipped leaves showed signs disease removed 
stem eight ten leaves 
leaves began turn rather yellow mr hardy announced time cutting arrived one morning hands mustered work 
consisted merely cutting stems level earth laying plants gently upon ground 
breakfast time two acres cleared 
left day dry sun little sunset taken carried one store sheds cleared prepared purpose 
placed heap ground covered raw hides mats left three days heat 
uncovered hung laths roofs close yet sufficiently far apart allow air circulate 
remained quite dry taken damp covering chosen operation otherwise dry leaves would crumbled dust 
laid heap covered allow heat 
second heating required days accomplish operation required great attention tobacco would worthless plants heated much 
ten days operation complete 
leaves stripped upper leaves placed also middle lower leaves higher ones finest quality 
tied bundles twelve leaves packed layers barrels great pressure applied weighted lever press almost solid mass 
filled three barrels smallest containing sixty pounds finest tobacco mr hardy kept use friends rest sold buenos ayres profitable rate 
venture like cotton proved success trouble care required great mr hardy determined future plant sufficient use men employed upon estate 
next experiment perfected sugar cane 
far others mrs hardy girls took lively interest 
sugar one articles consumption cost money used considerable quantities converting fruit fine puddings preserves 
contemplated make sugar sale supply house two acres therefore extent plantation 
mr hardy procured cuttings friend small sugar plantation near buenos ayres 
cultivation sugar simple 
land got perfect order deep furrows ploughed distance five feet apart 
cuttings pieces upper part cane containing two three knots laid distance three feet apart 
plough taken along side furrow fill cover cuttings 
sugar plantations rows canes close together mr hardy chosen distance enabled horse hoe work thus keep ground turned free weeds without expense hard labor 
short time shoots appeared soil 
four months gained height fourteen feet glossy stems showed ready cut 
clara mr hardy said manufacture know work superintendence 
canes ready cut intend crush juice really important question 
young hardys looked aghast pressure matters question apparatus sugar manufacture quite forgotten 
really idea frank really dear 
certainly wood place would make rollers besides would rather difficult business 
mrs hardy thought minute said think mangle would 
general exclamation capital mamma burst laughter idea making sugar mangle 
mangle question part patent washing apparatus mr hardy brought england consisted two strong iron rollers kept together strong springs turning handle 
think mangle would clara mr hardy said much obliged idea 
thought great washing copper boiling sugar mangle altogether escaped 
begin morrow 
please get tubs scrubbed scalded put sun dry 
long take papa days ethel must cut canes fast boiler boil juice 
next day work began 
canes cut level ground tops taken canes cut lengths three feet 
packed bullock cart taken house 
next passed mangle succeeded admirably juice flowing streams tub placed receive 
canes passed mangle screws tightened increase pressure passed time although juice thoroughly extracted would powerful machine quantity remained important 
tub filled contents taken great copper fire lighted 
crushing canes continued copper nearly full mr hardy ordered cutting canes discontinued day 
fire copper fed crushed canes burnt freely 
mr hardy added small quantity lime sheep blood last ingredient caused many exclamations horror mrs hardy young ones 
blood however mr hardy informed necessary clarify sugar albumen contained blood would rise surface bringing impurities 
fire continued thermometer showed syrup within degrees boiling surface covered thick dark colored scum 
fire removed liquor allowed cool family going work large quantity liquor would really cold next day 
following morning tap bottom boiler turned syrup came bright clear color sherry wine 
scum descended unbroken surface liquor copper nearly empty tap closed scum little liquor remained taken 
bright syrup poured boiler fire lighted syrup kept boiling evaporate water condense syrup point would crystallize 
required many hours boiling effect scum rose surface carefully taken skimmer 
last found syrup skimmer began crystallize mr hardy pronounced fit draw large washing tubs crystallize 
fresh batch canes crushed process repeated canes cut 
took fortnight altogether five days actually occupied cutting crushing canes 
sugar crystallized taken dark pulpy looking mass young hardys looked doubtfully placed large sugar hogshead procured purpose 
bottom eight large holes bored stopped pieces plantain stalk 
porous substance stalks molasses treacle slowly drained 
wet sugar placed cask layers slices plantain stems laid upon spongy substance draws dark coloring matter sugar 
plantain grows freely south america mr hardy planted number graceful tree near house advanced enough cut therefore procured sufficient quantity friend rosario 
three months drainage molasses quite ceased hardys greatly pleased emptying hogshead removing plantain stems find sugar dry fairly light color 
sugar canes require planting grow many years roots although canes old stools called produce less sugar first year planting juice clearer requires far less trouble prepare refine 
another year came round boys made pair wooden rollers eighteen inches diameter 
covered strips hoop iron nailed lengthways upon short intervals thereby obtaining better grip upon canes preventing wood bruised grooved 
rollers worked horse mill mr hardy ordered england 
made five horses great deal useful work grinding indian corn fine flour home consumption sale neighbouring settlers coarse meal pulping pumpkins roots pigs animals 
mr hardy also tried many experiments climate suited almost every kind plant vegetable 
among cultivation ginger vanilla bean flax hemp coffee 
obtained less success difficulty obtaining labor necessity devoting attention increasing flocks herds irrigated land prevented carrying large scale 
however served purpose principally undertook giving objects interest amusement children

chapter xv 
pampas fire 
party started canter pace knew horses would able keep longest time breaking every half hour walk ten minutes give breathing time 
well mounted strong serviceable animals cases bought specially speed hardys 
evident chase would long one 
indians twelve hours start much lighter men whites carried less additional weight 
horses therefore could travel fast far pursuers 
sheep would true encumbrance cattle could scarcely termed probable first day would make journey fifty sixty miles traveling moderate pace would know instant pursuit could take place 
indeed strength peon estimated five hundred men would render certain extent careless upon open plain charge number men would sweep away force could collected short obtaining strong body troops rosario 
next two days probable would make long speedy journeys animals could accomplish 
well country would cease travel rapidly pursuit ever attempted former instances 
difficulty following track 
mr mercer possessed nearly thousand cattle five thousand sheep ground trampled broad unmistakeable line 
twice mr hardy consulted compass 
trail ran south west west 
much talking 
whole party impressed terrible scene witnessed tremendously hazardous nature enterprise undertaken indulge general conversation 
gradually however steady rapid motion sense strength reliance lessened sombre expression general talk began mostly upon indian fights older settlers one time taken part 
mr hardy took part encouraged conversation 
knew necessary expedition sort keep spirits engaged endeavored therefore shake heavy weight care give animation life 
spirits younger men rose rapidly insensibly pace increased mr hardy leader party compelled recall necessity saving animals many already come ten fifteen miles arriving rendezvous mercers 
three hours steady riding arrived banks small stream 
mr hardy called halt purpose resting animals 
think said must done five twenty miles 
give hour rest another fifteen 
already done forty knock first day 
girths loosened horses work cropping sweet grass near water edge 
whole party threw sloping bank pipes taken lit probable direction chase discussed 
short time charley rose saying see get anything better dried meat supper exchanged rifle mr hardy double barrelled gun carried terence whistling retriever strolled stream 
ten minutes double barrels heard short distance quarter hour afterwards time faintly 
ten minutes hour appeared wiping perspiration face seven half brace plump duck 
killed four shots said threw 
asleep pools let fly right middle heard 
general feeling satisfaction sight birds tied couples fastened horses 
two minutes saddles hubert saying father started one satisfaction papa miss way 
ride far enough must overtake 
mr hardy shook head 
knew enough indian warfare certain every artifice maneuver would looked baffled even believing safe pursuit indians never neglect take every possible precaution 
riding two hours longer mr hardy consulted guachos stream near said would least two hours riding reached another uncertain supply 
mr hardy therefore decided halt men knew part plain thoroughly hunting ostriches frequent expeditions search strayed cattle 
lived hunted one time another indians 
many guachos take abode permanently indians adopted members tribe living dressing like indians 
visits generally undertaken avoid consequences little difficulty man killed gambling quarrel rivalry love 
sometimes make peace satisfy blood relations bull secure absolution readily enough confession gift small sum church return former life often remain indians even attain rank noted chiefs among 
men accompanied expedition former class 
taken pampas escape consequences crime grown perfectly sick returned civilised life 
point morals perhaps desirable companions brave enough thoroughly knew country farther inland enthusiastic adventure yet willing enough follow respective masters ready fight lives upon occasion 
halted mr herries thought caught sight deer short way ahead 
therefore started stalk several others going directions 
mr herries proceeded cautiously wind fortunately towards enabled creep tolerably close 
animals extremely shy however idea danger could get within fair shot 
knew would another instant practiced trick often found successful 
threw back pulled red handkerchief neck tied one boots let float freely air threw legs form letter v began moving slowly waving fro 
deer upon point flight paused gaze strange object began move circle looks still directed unknown thing gradually kept approaching moved round 
last fairly shot herries whose legs beginning weary sprang feet another instant foremost deer lay quivering death 
taking upon shoulders proceeded camp arrival hailed acclamation 
fire already alight made grass turf former pulled handfuls roots making fierce short lived blaze 
large quantity collected hand ducks already cut 
half one handed every man cook upon pampas 
hunters shortly returned bringing another little deer stag pampas small size 
speedily skinned guachos cut party engaged roasting duck venison steaks steel ramrods fire 
satisfied double handful tea thrown kettle already boiling pipes lighted general feeling comfort experienced 
horses picketed close hand man cut pulled heap grass placed beast beside picket ropes allowed horse crop grass growing small circle center 
mr hardy chatted apart time guachos anxious know much possible country entering 
others chatted told stories 
presently mr hardy joined general conversation pause said although friends consider improbable indians neighborhood still possible may remained purpose fall night upon party might venture pursue 
rate right begin work business like way 
therefore propose keep watches regularly 
nine clock 
shall moving five make four watches two hours 
say three men watch stationed fifty yards camp upon different sides would suffice 
general assent proposal 
save trouble mr hardy went suggest keep watch alphabetical order names 
twelve us night next twelve morrow night 
proposal agreed three first duty rose taking rifles went various directions first agreeing one give single whistle signal watch two whistles close together would warning retreat towards center 
watch also ascertained next three men roused succeeding watches agreed lie next order might roused without awakening companions 
minutes general unrolling ponchos soon afterwards sleeping figures could seen dim light smouldering fire 
mr hardy indeed one party fall sleep 
thoughts events last twenty four hours best course adopted heavy responsibility upon leader perilous expedition prevented sleeping 
heard watch return rouse relief lay places 
another half hour rose walked towards sentry 
young man named cook one new settlers east mount pleasant 
mr hardy asked approached 
coming wake 
mr cook strikes sir strange light away south west 
noticed last minutes thought fancy gets distinct every minute 
mr hardy looked anxiously gloom quickly perceived appearance friend alluded 
minute two speak light evidently increased said almost groan feared would set prairie fire 
need keep watch longer 
much separated indians ocean divided us 
cook gave two short whistles agreed upon recall men guard returned mr hardy rest party 
mr hardy roused companions 
every man leapt rifle hand believing indians approaching 
must mr hardy said cheerfully indians fired pampas 
thrill apprehension bosom many present heard terrible accounts prairie fires speedily subsided calm manner mr hardy 
fire said may ten miles away yet 
say difficult judge grass flame high smoke drifts us 
wind fortunately light little half hour 
let four guachos attend horses see stampede 
rest form line couple yards apart pull grass roots throwing behind leave ground clear 
wider make better 
fell work hearty zeal 
looking shoulders sky appeared fire 
flickering tongues flame seemed struggle upwards 
occasional sound feet herds deer flew danger 
far go papa think hubert asked father next work 
say would likely stop stream halted day hubert 
ground wet boggy distance side 
horses getting restive momentary pause work wrap ponchos round heads prevent seeing glare 
fire could three miles distant space cleared wide mr hardy deemed necessary safety 
regular noise something hiss roar plainly audible wind lifted smoke flames could seen running along unbroken wall fire 
birds flew past head terrified cries close hot smell burning plainly distinguishable 
starting half way along side cleared piece ground mr hardy set dry grass alight 
moment two burned slowly fanned wind gained force spread semicircle flame 
horses already unpicketed half party held short distance rear rest stood readiness extinguish fire crossed cleared space 
fire crept partially across clearing done roughly speedily stamped heavy boots watchers 
spectacle fire swept away wind fine extreme 
party seemed enclosed two walls fire 
main conflagration fearfully close burning flakes already falling amongst sound fire like hiss surf upon pebbly beach 
mr hardy said forward horses 
every one animal 
put ponchos heads well horses 
another minute party stood clustered upon black smoking ground fire kindled swept clear 
five minutes remained without moving unscorched raging element around half choked smoke 
mr hardy spoke 
look 
general expression astonishment heads emerged wrappers eyes recovered sufficiently effects blinding smoke look round 
fire gone indeed main conflagration swept divided two reached ground already burnt columns growing farther farther asunder newly kindled fire widened already far away right left beyond fire kindled two miles wide already far distance 
fires pampas although frequently extend vast tract country seldom fatal life 
grass rarely attains height exceeding three feet burns almost like much cotton 
man horseback method escape blindfolding horse wrapping face poncho ride fearlessly wall fire without damage horse rider 
therefore young hands felt uneasiness sight fire settlers habit regularly setting fire grass upon farms every year rains grass afterwards springs fresh green animals 
care taken choose calm day flames confined within bounds instances occurred fires commenced proved disastrous destroying many thousands animals 
nothing remain morning mr hardy said 
horses better picketed better get hours sleep 
shall want watch night 
minutes party asleep young hardys follow example mr hardy came said quietly come way boys going council 
boys followed father eight nine men sitting short distance sleepers boys made glow pipes consist herries farquhar two jamiesons mr percy four guachos 
terribly bad business mr hardy began sons taken seats ground 
expected heavy blow nevertheless 
matter papa boys exclaimed anxiously 
lost anything yes boys mr hardy said lost moment important thing world lost trail 
charley hubert uttered simultaneous exclamation dismay truth flashed across minds 
trail lost never thought 
excitement fire never occurred flames wiping every trace indian track 
mr hardy went addressing others course fire lit especial intent throwing us scent 
idea far likely come asked guachos 
aware existence wide stream damp ground would checked must therefore farthest boundary fire guachos silent minute perez said next stream fifteen miles farther small would stop fire going wind 
beyond certain stream far know 
ground rises grass gets thinner poorer thirty miles 
say would light side martinez said 
guachos nodded assent 
took bearings track compass farquhar said 
could follow compass across burnt ground hit upon side mr percy mr hardy shook heads 
pretend say trail gone former said one place quite sure continuation present line 
mr hardy continued 
say percy certainly 
indians got place probably half across burnt ground turned either right left traveled steadily direction sending one two number old direction light grass sweep away trace trail 
may gone right left may even doubled back passed us miles distance 
clue whatever guide us present except certainty sooner later indians make camping ground 
exact state affair 
mr hardy repeated said spanish guachos nodded assent 
direction guachos believe camping ground lies mr jamieson asked pause appears waste time look trail plan push straight villages may reach get 
case found unguarded might seize women hold hostages return 
could exchange ethel got could fight way back 
capital capital english exclaimed 
think papa hubert added seeing mr hardy join general approval 
plan admirably conceived one great difficulty way 
observed yesterday trail lead due south done indians going straight back camping ground 
questioned guachos agree subject 
trail westerly camping grounds pampas indians far south country flat faces sierras 
fear combination two tribes attack upon us went first day direction would advantageous reaching halting place perhaps twenty thirty miles made division booty tribe drew towards hunting grounds 
case first find two trails decide terrible question party taken ethel guachos upon translated expressed perfect accordance mr hardy views surprise ideas identical upon subject 
six young men dismayed unexpected difficulties started way give opinion whatever 
uncertainty terrible felt would depressing effect upon upon whole expedition could tell journeying hundreds miles whether every step might take farther object search state depression remained minutes perez guacho said broken english tribe take plunder cattle sheep take girl 
well thought perez mr hardy exclaimed warmly 
clue us sure enough 
say tribe furnished men matter course take larger share booty ethel captive would naturally go strongest tribe 
rest delighted solution difficulty appeared insuperable lively satisfaction manifested 
plans day discussed 
propositions made divide two parties go one right left arrived unburnt ground edge follow met 
scheme however given neither party would seen trail inspected opinion could therefore formed respective magnitude parties passed matter requiring careful examination comparison accurate practiced judgment 
finally resolved therefore keep body proceed first place search trail party south 
calculation made upon supposition indians traveled another twenty five miles upon old course separated party making directly home 
avoid mistakes allow detour determined shape direct course point considerably east given calculation follow edge burnt ground trail arrived cut straight across order find examine trail western indians 
conclusion arrived first dawn light appeared east mr hardy roused sleepers 
gave brief account conclusions arrived night reason 
general expression agreement girths tightened five minutes troop motion 
great change since preceding evening far eye could reach stretched plain waving grass 
birds called mates coveys game risen approach deer seen bounding away distance ostriches gazed instant unusual sight man gone heads forward wings stretched wind 
eye wandered plain dingy black unbroken single prominence undisturbed living creatures except 
hubert remarked father looked snowing black night 
men horses anxious get dreary plains pace faster halts less frequent day 
fortunate fire taken place earlier hour evening horses would weakened want food 
five hours feed arrival 
men horses however suffered much thirst former good reason congratulate filled every water skin first halting place preceding day 
clouds black impalpable dust rose rode along 
eyes mouth nostrils filled literally black ground rode 
twice stopped drank sparingly washed nostrils mouths horses great relief suffered much masters also dash owing head near ground almost suffocated indeed hubert last dismounted took poor animal saddle 
last four hours steady riding gleam color seen distance another quarter hour reached unburnt plains worn parched looked refreshing indeed dreary waste passed 
guachos consultation among agreed opinion little stream spoken short distance farther although channel might dry pools would doubt found 
determined therefore push half hour riding edge burnt grass brought spot following course channel soon came pool men horses took long drink 
approach immense number wild duck rose soon horses picketed charley started gun taking terence assist bringing home birds 
soon heard gun terence presently returned six brace ducks goose request another man would go back birds abundant apparently stupified flying smoke flame could bring quantity 
one jamiesons herries therefore went returned less hour charley bringing four geese eighteen brace ducks 
charley greeted round applause soon work friends upon meal ready 
breakfast comparison opinion last generally agreed ridden nearly forty miles since daybreak could far spot indians ought passed kept direction calculated 
also agreed would better let horses remain till late afternoon might accomplish another fifteen miles 
mr hardy proposed inclined accompany walk along edge burnt ground 
far trail said calculations correct find examine time start may able night cross side thus gain hours 
herries farquhar two jamiesons cook young hardys volunteered walk shouldering rifles started steady pace 
walked much mile shout pleasure broke upon ascending slight rise saw hollow broad line trampled grass showed large body animals lately passed along 
hurried forward close anxious examination took place 
opinions differed good deal number passed accustomed seeing tracks made herds cattle flocks sheep could come approximate agreement subject 
number smaller task would easier question requiring extreme knowledge judgment decide whether four hundred cattle two thousand sheep six hundred cattle three thousand sheep passed piece ground 
mr hardy last sent charley back accompanied mr cook request mr percy come guachos give opinion 
charley companions remain horses request specially sent stay also would imprudent extreme leave horses without strong guard 
pending arrival mr percy mr hardy friends followed trail distance examine soft bottoms rises 
returned half hour starting place shortly joined mr percy guachos 
careful prolonged examination took place tolerably unanimous opinion last arrived large number animals passed apparently larger half positive opinion could arrived comparison made trail western side 
although conclusion arrived unanimously appeared reluctantly conceded reason became apparent walking back towards horses 
little doubt conclusion arrived correct herries remarked although somehow sorry ever since talk last night made mind likely taken west 
suppose indians warlike pampas therefore likely furnished larger contingent 
course reason thinking 
thought hubert said englishmen admitted entertained somewhat similar idea 
four afternoon saddle taken precaution filling water skins watering horses last thing 
far think across papa hubert asked 
far hubert 
much nearer place fire began think spread ten miles across 
mr hardy conjecture proved correct 
hour half riding brought side burnt prairie striking point felt sure south place trail would left 
done fifty miles since morning horses much distressed effect dust resolved encamp 
horses received little water picketed graze 
fire soon lit ducks cut spitted upon ramrods 
much exhausted heat ashes fatigue want sleep previous night tea pipes finished watch posted rest laid sleep sun hour horizon 
rose daybreak refreshed quiet night rest soon saddle way northward 
nearly hour ride came upon trail 
unmistakeably first sight broad much trampled careful examination one opinion namely number animals passed decidedly less gone south 
one guachos told mr hardy knew short distance west spring water much used indians doubt halted night fire 
finding half hour ride mr hardy brief consultation determined go water horses breakfast retracing footsteps across burnt prairie 
little time named came small pool bright water little stream issued running nearly due north across plain 
drinking heartily filling water skins kettle horses allowed drink dash plunged greatest delight emerging usual bright chestnut color whereas gone water perfectly black 
come shaken commenced hunting sniffing violently hubert attention attracted 
presently dog ran forward paces gave sharp bark pleasure hubert running forward gave loud cry party rushed 
hubert could speak 
half buried ground pointing west indian arrow round head twisted piece white calico little blue spots upon mr hardy instantly recognized piece dress ethel worn left home 
surprise kept quiet exclamations pleasure excitement broke mr hardy sons greatly affected proof recent presence lost one 
arrow deeply sunk ground placed spot grass happened particularly short one passing outward spring could hardly failed notice piece calico upon grass 
perfect shower congratulations time recovered sufficiently renew preparations breakfast 
last sat round fire faces radiant excitement 
perez martinez however sat somewhat apart talking animated undertone 
even approach fire roast food mr hardy attention attracted circumstance asked talking earnestly 
neither answered repeated question 
perez replied martinez think 
trick girl gone way 
conversation eating alike suspended ominous words looked blankly others faces 
attention called whole circumstances case rushed minds felt probable truth perez said hopes fell zero 
mr percy first long silence spoke 
afraid hardy perez says right nearly thrown scent transparent trick 
watched ethel must probable could possessed arrow fastened strip dress without noticed still impossible could placed arrow found 
one could passed without noticing unless suppose allowed linger behind every one question arrow could put 
true percy mr hardy said sigh short silence altogether impossible call clumsy artifice deceived us 
however one comfort decides question decided ethel gone larger party south 
breakfast continued subdued feeling 
hubert finished lad restless habit took arrow lay beside began toying 
first untied piece stuff smoothed put pocket book eyes filled tears continued listlessly twisting arrow fingers listened conversation around 
presently eyes fell upon arrow 
started flush excitement rushed across face hands lips trembled closely examined feather 
gazed astonishment 
oh papa papa cried last know arrow know arrow repeated 
yes quite quite sure know 
remember charley day wounded indians started taking quivers noticed one arrow two feathers never seen could guess bird came 
light blue crimson tip 
pulled one compare others 
home 
remember chose one one two little side feathers gone

occasionally raven two three braves would pay visit day two depart presents blankets things tribe needed 
upon first visits hubert questioned respecting bird whose remarkable feather means saving ethel life 
next visit chief brought two perfect skins bird 
turned hubert great delight new species one many hitherto unknown birds fallen gun british museum specific names hardiensis compliment discoverer 
raven tribe honourably performed agreement mr hardy never joined subsequent attacks upon whites 
much weakened loss many fighting men would probably exterminated hostile tribes mr hardy subsequently furnished supply military muskets bought chiefly purpose together ammunition able oppose resolute front enemies support hunting 
raven one powerful respected chiefs upon plains pampas 
return expedition rescue ethel chastisement indians heart country caused quite sensation throughout republic 
mrs hardy maud joy need speak adventure considered matter congratulation joy throughout whole district

consequence quite rush neighborhood land taken occupied directions 
well mrs hardy girls sail next mail england 
effect terrible four days upon ethel week anxiety upon mother sister shaken change even previously determined upon would imperatively necessary 
much say mrs hardy maud suffered even ethel 
least known seen danger sustained except morning fastened stake strong hope belief rescue 
left behind could nothing picture scenes horror pass time alternately praying weeping 
sadly shaken nervous short time remained mount pleasant sea voyage fresh breezes soon brought health color cheeks none ever felt bad effects terrible week 
story drawing close 
stormy period mount pleasant settlement 
hard work difficulties dangers life new settler extreme edge civilisation passed nothing remained continue devote attention energy estate reap fruits labor 
two years departure wife daughters mr hardy remained post 
nearly six years since left england longed return 
felt could without uneasiness future 
rosario according anticipation rising large important town country fairly settled leagues beyond estate land rapidly rising value fear whatever indian attacks 
flocks herds multiplied greatly doubling every two years 
income obtained sale cattle fatted alfalfa upon sale wool farm produce considerable 
dairy alone brought large yearly amount 
charley twenty two hubert year younger capable managing estate 
one day therefore unfolded plans 
know boys going england shortly although shall perhaps come shall make england permanent home 
boys therefore jointly manage estate 
income year reach would much keep greater portion animals increase stock 
bank 
busy life led could remain inactive 
present intention take large farm upon long lease option purchase 
object obtain farm large acreage poor land improvable better drainage outlay capital 
shall risk also income draw next two years 
profits increase year 
shall therefore two years sunk farm portion devoted building suitable house 
course two years spend whatever money may require fact impossible spend much money 
end two years propose first charley elder shall come home england year hubert shall take turn 
stay year together year england regularly 
end two years shall draw half income estate take half invest use may think fit 
end six years calculate estate stocked many cattle sheep support 
fifteen thousand cattle say thirty thousand sheep 
sell annual increase profits greater every year 
end ten years time think probable enough life sell estate 
time center populous district land greatly increased value equal country much indeed probably question find purchaser whole 
could therefore break suit purchasers dividing lots one two three four square miles square league dividing stock proportion 
house would course go arable land mile two pasture beyond 
share yearly income shall devote buying estate 
say price 
shall income income estate probably able make ten years 
estate propose risk drainage etc ought worth
