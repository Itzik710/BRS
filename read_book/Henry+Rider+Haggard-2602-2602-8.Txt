last came place fallen altogether shaken presume great earthquake destroyed much ancient cave city 
spot oliver instruments calculations could trusted within two hundred feet floor den lions seemed probable passage led course question arose done 
council held discuss problem maqueda abati notables present 
oliver explained even possible would useless clear old passage end find den lions 
plan asked maqueda 
lady answered servant instructed attempt destroy idol harmac means explosives brought us england 
first would ask still cling design abandoned inquired maqueda 
two things lady 
act war deed seems useless since supposing sphinx shattered certain number priests guards destroyed advance cause secondly destruction difficult done 
stuff us true fearful strength yet sure enough move mountain hard rock calculate weight measurements knowledge size cavities within bulk 
lastly attempt made tunnel must hollowed less three hundred feet length first downward upward base idol done within six weeks night marriage daughter barung work hard indeed completed although hundreds men labor day night 
maqueda thought looked said friend brave skilful tell us mind 
sat place would lady would lead every able bodied man attack city fung say night great festival guard 
would blow gates city harmac storm drive away fung afterwards take possession idol thought necessary destroy piecemeal within 
maqueda consulted councillors appeared much disturbed suggestion finally called us back gave us decision 
lords council said speaking ring contempt voice declare plan mad never sanction abati could persuaded undertake dangerous enterprise attack upon city harmac would end think killed 
point orme prophecy fung leave plain harmac god destroyed therefore must destroyed 
say orme year companions sworn servants abati business receive orders give also condition upon earn pay destroy idol fung 
decision council spoken mouth prince joshua command shall set business execute companions present mur

oh heat narrow hole deep bowels rock reek stagnant air sometimes bad lights would scarcely burn

good night fellows better getting home must early morrow want sleep 
following morning five clock higgs awakened one knocking door 
rose opened whereon walked quick grim grimy figure soaked clothes soiled face told us left work mine 
captain wants see soon possible gentlemen said 
matter sergeant asked higgs got garments 
see presently professor laconic reply could get anything 
five minutes later advancing run dense darkness underground city us carrying lamp 
reached ruins old temple first quick seemed tired lagged behind atmosphere higgs scant breath could travel fast 
doorway place slept stood tall form oliver holding lamp aloft 
evidently waiting us 
side sat big yellow dog pharaoh smelt us gambolled forward wagging tail greeting 
come said orme low solemn voice something show led way priest chamber sanctuary whatever may slept upon rough native made bedstead 
doorway halted lowered lamp held pointed something dark floor right bedstead saying look lay dead man side great knife evidently fallen hand 
first glance recognized face way singularly peaceful though one plunged deep sleep 
seemed odd since throat literally torn 
shadrach said one voice 
shadrach shadrach former guide betrayed us shadrach save life shown us rescue higgs service pardoned think mentioned 
shadrach pussy seems prowl met dog remarked quick

perhaps better explain anything moved 
shadrach must crept last night know time slept purposes

yes answered orme came murder right risk wonder sent may go wondering rest life captain exclaimed quick 
still think might guess tried 
news happened sent palace within little hour maqueda arrived accompanied joshua several members council

course proved completely innocent slightest idea set murderer work deed darkness 
anybody else general suggestion shadrach attempted revenge met due reward crime 
day poor pharaoh poisoned 
well done work memory blessed 
chapter xv sergeant quick presentiment time forward us especially oliver guarded night day picked men believed could corrupted 
consequence tsar russia scarcely leads life irksome became mur 
privacy none left us since sentries detectives lurked every corner tasters obliged eat dish drink cup touched lips lest fate pharaoh whose loss mourned much though poor dog beloved human 
irksome think oliver maqueda whose opportunities meeting much curtailed exigencies rigid espionage 
murmur sweet nothings adored two soldiers armed teeth instructed never let sight particularly adored happens ruler soldiers person guarded right making agreeable 
duty even faithful guardians apt talk 
course result pair took risks escape observation 
indeed intimate relations became matter gossip throughout land 
still annoying might precautions succeeded none us poisoned got throats cut although constantly victims mysterious accidents 
thus heavy rock rolled upon us sat together one evening upon hill side flight arrows passed us riding along edge thicket one higgs horse killed 
mountain thicket searched one could found 
moreover great plot us discovered lords priests implicated state feeling country beyond warning privately machinations known maqueda dare take proceedings men 
little later things mended far concerned following reason one day two shepherds arrived palace companions saying news communicate 
questioned peasants averred herding goats upon western cliffs many miles away suddenly top hills appeared body fifteen fung bound blindfolded telling mocking language take message council white men 
message better make haste destroy god harmac since otherwise head would move mur according prophecy fung would follow knew 
set two men rock could seen following morning fact found fellows accompanied court corroborated story 
course matter duly investigated know went search party got place trace fung could found except one spears handle driven earth blade pointed toward mur evidently threat defiance 
token remained happened heavy rain fallen obliterated footprints case must faint rocky ground 
notwithstanding diligent search skilled men mode approach retreat remained mystery indeed day 
places supposed possible scale precipice mur watched continually could climbed none 
inference therefore fung discovered unknown path fifteen men could climb path fifteen thousand path vain great rewards land honors offered discover although discoveries continually reported investigation found inventions mares nests 
nothing bird could traveled roads 
last saw abati thoroughly frightened additions story soon passed mouth mouth till whole people talked nothing else 
though english learned huge foreign army suddenly landed shores cut wires seized railways marching upon london 
effect tidings upon nation always believed invasion impossible may easily imagined hope take better abati 
swagger self confidence talk rocky walls mur evaporated hour 
disciplined terrible regiments fung among every man trained war would happen civilized domesticated abati peace loving people rightly enough declared refused martial burdens regiments suddenly appear midst 
cried betrayed clamoured blood certain councillors

priests premium sheep cattle sacrificed even said fashion foes fung human beings shared fate 
rate almighty importuned hourly destroy hated fung protect people abati results base selfishness cowardly neglect 
well world seen exhibitions day doubtless see instance greater peoples allow luxury pleasure seeking sap strength manhood 
upshot abati became obsessed saying fung scouts shepherds repetition envoys delivered council little hasten destroy idol harmac lest move mur 
idol proportions even head could move stop inquire 
obvious however destroyed would nothing move gentiles persons could possibly effect destruction 
also became popular little 
everybody pleasant flattered us everybody even joshua bowed approached took lively interest progress work many deputations prominent individuals urged us expedite 
better still untoward accidents mentioned ceased 
dogs obtained others longer poisoned rocks appeared fixed fall arrows whistled among us went riding 
even found safe occasionally dispense guards since every one interest keep us alive present 
still one deceived single moment season season warned others wind would soon blow less favourable quarter

remarkable general plan operations founded upon mere hypothetical estimate proved accurate 
length prepared deadly cast iron flasks packed sand together dynamite cartridges necessary detonators electric wires forth anxious indeed awful task executed entirely stifling atmosphere hands orme quick

great numbers abati surrounded us dare make direct attack commenced shooting arrows killed wounded number men

five minutes afterwards everything 
joshua soldiers threw arms ran galloped right left save number fled gates palace opened across drawbridge courtyards within 
rather mixed followed mountaineers killing could find hand would listen commands maqueda officers show mercy 
dawn broke strange moonlit battle ended small affair true five hundred men engaged upon side three four thousand yet one cost great number lives beginning ruin followed 
well safe since certain lesson learned joshua would attempt storm double walls fosse palace without long preparation 
yet even new trouble awaited us means never discovered wing palace maqueda private rooms situated suddenly burst flames 
personally believe fire arose fact lamp left burning near bed child kings upon laid body sergeant quick 
perhaps wounded man hidden overturned lamp perhaps draught blowing open doors brought gold spangled curtains contact wick

orme said easterns strange people believe thing maqueda may something 
understand message means war last unequal war looked hordes abati gathering great square 
yes answered quietly understand however sore straits however strange may seem things happen fear end war friends 
chapter xviii burning palace orme right 
maqueda defiance mean war unequal war 
position 
shut long range buildings one end burned account moat double wall defended vigor could stormed enemy great courage determination prepared face heavy sacrifice life 
circumstance favor since abati courageous much disliked idea killed even injured 
advantage ended 
deducting lost previous night garrison amounted something four hundred men fifty wounded dangerously 
moreover ammunition short shot away arrows battle square means obtaining 
worst palace provisioned siege mountaineers three days rations sun dried beef goat flesh hard kind biscuit made indian corn mixed barley meal 
thus saw beginning unless could manage secure food case must soon grow hopeless 
remained yet another danger 
although palace stone built gilded domes ornamental turrets timber therefore liable fired indeed already happened 
roof also ancient cedar beams thinly covered concrete interior containing enormous quantity panels rather boarding cut resinous wood 
abati hand amply supplied every kind store weapon could bring great force blockade us though force composed timid undisciplined rabble 
well made best preparations could although see much since day time occupied attending wounded help son rough orderlies whose experience doctoring part confined cattle 
pitiful business proved without aid sthetics proper supply bandages appliances 
although medicine chest furnished upon liberal scale proved totally inadequate casualties battle 
still best saved lives though many cases developed gangrene slipped fingers 
meanwhile higgs worked nobly notwithstanding flesh wounds pained considerably orme also best assistance japhet officers highland regiment 
palace thoroughly examined weak places defences made good 
available force divided watches stationed best advantage 
number men set work manufacture arrow shafts cedar beams plenty wooden stables outhouses lay back main building point wing supply iron barbs feathers fortunately discovered one guard houses 
horses remained shed killed salted food forth 
also every possible preparation made repel attempts storm paving stones piled throw upon heads assailants fires lighted walls heat pitch oil water purpose 
disappointment direct assault delivered desperate methods commending abati 
plan attack take cover wherever could especially among trees garden beyond gates thence shoot arrows one appeared upon walls even fire volleys clouds normans hastings might fall upon heads persons courtyards 
although cautious tactics cost us several men advantage furnishing us supply ammunition sorely needed 
spent arrows carefully collected made use enemy shot whenever opportunity offered 
little damage however since extremely careful expose 
fashion three dreary days went past unrelieved incident except feint scarcely abati made upon second night apparently object forcing great gates cover rainstorm 
advance discovered repelled two three volleys arrows rifle shots 
rifles indeed whereof possessed score abati terribly afraid 
picking intelligent soldiers taught handle spare guns though course shooting extremely erratic result backed accurate marksmanship force enemy take cover 
indeed one two experiences effect bullets man would show open within five hundred yards night fallen 
third afternoon held council determine must done since last twenty four hours obvious things could continue 
begin sufficient food left keep force starvation two days 
also spirits soldiers brave men enough actual fighting concerned beginning flag atmosphere inaction 
gathered groups talked wives children would happen hands joshua also cattle crops saying doubtless ravaged houses burned 
vain maqueda promise five fold loss war ended evidently hearts thought could end one way 
moreover pointed could give back children killed 
melancholy council every possible plan discussed find resolved two alternatives surrender take bull horns sally palace night attack joshua 
face latter scheme appearance suicide fact desperate seemed 
abati cowards quite probable would run thousands onset hundred determined men victory declared child kings bulk subjects would return allegiance 
settled preference surrender knew meant death maqueda choice last grim solution troubles forced marriage 
others convinced namely mountaineers 
japhet present council sent summon except actually guard assembled large inner court maqueda went addressed 
remember exact words speech made note extremely beautiful touching 
pointed plight could halt longer two opinions must either fight yield 
said care since although young ruler set store upon life would give gladly rather driven marriage considered shameful forced pass beneath yoke traitors 
us foreigners care 
come country invitation served nobly one us given life protect person violation safeguard council threatened dreadful death 
subjects lacking honor hospitality would suffer thing blow struck save us majority shouted silent one old captain advanced saluted spoke 
child kings said let us search truth matter 
love foreign soldier orme trouble arisen love unlawful according law solemnly affianced prince joshua maqueda considered awhile replied said slowly friend heart therefore upon point answer question 
regards uncle joshua existed abiding contract us broken nights ago sent servants armed attack drag know whither 
would marry traitor coward spoken 
shouted majority soldiers 
silence followed old captain replied canniness almost scotch point raised child kings give opinion since woman high born one would listen doubtless follow heart speak whatever end appointed 
settle matter betrothed joshua 
also matter settle joshua toad long tongue seems slow yet never misses fly 
took cause killed great number people killed 
forget 
therefore seems wise make nest built since better die battle gallows 
reason since stay longer part willing go fight night although joshua people many shall think fortunate live see another sun 
hard reasoned speech seemed appeal dissentients result withdrew opposition agreed attempt break way besieging army one hour dawn would heavily asleep liable panic 
yet chanced sortie destined never take place perhaps fortunate us since convinced would ended failure 
true might forced way joshua army afterwards us remained alive would surrounded starved strength ammunition exhausted taken prisoners cut 
however may events shaped different course us perhaps abati got wind intention stomach pitched battle desperate men 
happened night sunset moonrise one darkness remarkable impossible see anything even foot away also wind blowing east made sounds inaudible 
men guard since necessary rested till time prepare great effort 
also little fear direct attack 
eight clock however son roderick one watch stationed gateway towers gifted quick ears reported thought heard people moving farther side massive wooden doors beyond moat 
accordingly us went listen could distinguish nothing concluded therefore mistaken 
retired posts waited patiently moon rise 
chanced moon rose rather could see sky completely covered thick banks thunder clouds presaging break period great heat 
wind died remained quite stationary upon face sky blotting light 
perhaps another hour passed chancing look behind saw thought meteor falling crest cliff palace built cliff whither head idol harmac carried force explosion 
look shooting star said oliver side 
shooting star fire replied startled voice spoke streaks light scores began rain brow cliff land upon wooden buildings rear palace dry tinder drought worse upon gilded timber domes roof

tied firebrands arrows spears burn us 
sound alarm 
sound alarm done presently great range buildings began hum like hive bees 
soldiers still half asleep rushed hither thither shouting 
officers also developing characteristic excitement abati race hour panic yelled screamed beating fists swords till kind control established 
attempts made extinguish flames time got hold half dozen places 
beginning effort absolutely hopeless 
true plenty water moat fed perennial stream flowed face precipice behind pumping engines sort quite unknown abati building took fire let burn contenting safeguarding neighborhood 
moreover even palace articles pails jugs vessels comparatively far

fast one fire extinguished others broke rain burning darts lighted pots lamps filled oil descended continuously cliff 
strange terrible sight see flashing darkness like fiery darts shall destroy wicked day armageddon 
still toiled despairingly

close wrapped dark cloak attended ladies stood maqueda 
quite calm although sundry burning arrows spears falling great force cliff struck flat roofs close stood 
ladies however calm 
wept wrung hands one went violent hysterics natural terror 
maqueda turned bade descend courtyard gateway said would join presently 
rushed rejoicing escape sight burning arrows one pierced man set clothes hair fire causing leap roof madness

silent moment near gateway heard brute screaming pretty pigeons pretty pigeons feathers singeing come pie pretty pigeons pretty pigeons followed shouts ribald laughter

presently flames brighter saw midst crowd admirers singing foul song another verse maqueda repeat good fortune managed put bullet head 
bad shot considering light circumstances one fired night

leave maqueda return message orme effect would move final catastrophe occurred 
amongst stables large shed filled dry fodder palace horses camels 
suddenly burst mass flame spread directions

every part palace mountaineers men officers together rushed gateway 
minute single exception japhet four maqueda left alone upon roof stood overwhelmed knowing 
heard drawbridge fall heard great doors burst upon beneath pressure mob men heard coarse voice thought joshua yell kill children death harms child kings 
spoil followed terrible sights sounds 
cunning abati stretched ropes outside doors noise made work reached roderick ears earlier darkness 
terrified soldiers flying fire stumbled fell ropes could rise pressed behind

ground floor found immediate danger since fire attacking part palace burning downward 
even time go respective sleeping places collect possessions valuables able carry 
fortunately among things included note books day priceless value 
laden articles met audience hall although hot seemed always huge empty place whereof roof painted stars supported upon thick cedar columns hewn single tree 
passing splendid apartment hour later ceased exist lamps hand found time fetch light reached mouth passage led underground city without meeting single human 
abati different race could perfectly well dashed made us prisoners drawbridge still intact

hole nothing proceeded stop stones fashion could forced without much toil considerable noise leaving one little tortuous channel necessary man could creep 
labor rock carrying even maqueda shared occupied minds awhile induced kind fictitious cheerfulness 
done chilly silence enormous cave striking comparison roar flames hideous human tumult left without fell upon us like sudden cold blinding night upon wanderer windy sunlit mountains excitement perished 
flash understood terrible position escaped red fire perish slowly black darkness 
still strove keep spirits best could 
leaving higgs watch blocked passage somewhat superfluous task since fire without best watchman rest us threaded way cave following telephone wire poor quick laid night blowing god harmac till came headquarters digging mine

man added passionately us face last peril every false shame wish conceal truth left man born bring woe upon head joy heart well well joy outweighs woe even angel led hither named azrael still shall bless revealed soul 
yet weep life could spared fulfil happiness land bore oh would gladly die 
oliver seemed deeply moved stepped began whisper ear evidently making proposal think guess nature

said nobly offered accept whatever universes may wander came would know trail blood blood loved 
perhaps crime separated ever 
moreover tell though seems black thick darkness believe things yet end well world another 
gone leaving orme staring like man trance

jolly well like know going end us got charming lady see us across styx 
puzzle brain answered gloomily think soon skeletons beastly cave

turns listened mouth passage echo footsteps never came 
nothing came break silence intense last ears craving sound magnified soft flitter bats noise eagle wings till last spoke whispers full voice man seemed affront solemn quietude seemed intolerable nerves 
yet first day two found occupation sort 
course first need secure supply food little originally laid use chambers old temple tinned meats brought london forth nearly consumed 
remembered maqueda told us corn estates stored annually pits provide possibility siege mur asked 
led us place round stone covers rings attached let floor cave unlike stop coal shoots town pavement larger 
great difficulty prised one seem moved since ancient kings ruled mur leaving open long air within purify lowered roderick rope report contents 
next moment heard saying want come please 
place pleasant 
pulled asked found 
nothing good eat answered plenty dead bones one rat ran leg 
tried next two pits result full human bones 
cross examined maqueda reflection informed us remembered five generations great plague fallen mur reduced population one half 
heard also stricken plague driven underground city order might infect others supposed bones saw remains 
information caused us close pits great hurry though really matter whether caught plague 
still sure corn buried somewhere went another group pits distant chamber opened first one 
time search rewarded extent found bottom mouldering dust years ago grain 
pits two sealed within three years date upon wax showed quite empty 
maqueda understood happened 
surely abati people rogues said 
see officers appointed store away corn gave stolen oh may live lack bread even bitterly day 
went back sleeping place silence 
well might silent food enough left single scanty meal 
water plenty food 
recovered little horrible disappointment consulted together 
could get mine tunnel said oliver might escape den lions probably destroyed explosion open country 
fung would take us suggested higgs

let us look said started 
reached passage led city tomb kings find wall end blown bodily back parent cave leaving opening could walk side side

matter anyway would burned palace 
time reached end vast tomb hunchbacked king used sit saw quest vain 
tunnel dug beyond utterly choked masses fallen rock could never hope move even aid explosives none left 
returned last hope gone 
also another trouble stared us face supply crude mineral oil abati used lighting purposes beginning run low 
measurement remained store laid use mine made revealed fact enough left supply four lamps three days nights one maqueda one one watchman near tunnel mouth one general purposes 
general purpose lamp matter fact mostly made use higgs 
truly furnished striking instance ruling passion strong death 
days starvation utter misery grew weak oil gave trudged backward forward old temple tomb kings carrying large basket arm 
going basket empty would bring back filled gold cups precious objects collected among bones scattered rubbish tomb 
objects laboriously catalogued pocket book night afterwards packed away empty cases contained supplies explosive goods carefully nailing filled

poor old higgs like tell disease starvation 
well went fetching carrying cataloguing packing 
remember last load brought golden head spoken wonderful likeness prehistoric king since excited much interest throughout world 
thing heavy carry weakened state much life size obliged roll accounts present somewhat damaged condition nose semi egyptian diadem 
never shall forget sight professor appeared darkness shuffling along upon knees garments worn holes feeble light lamp moved time time painfully pushing great yellow object forward foot two push 
last gasped triumphantly whilst watched indifferent eyes 
japhet help wrap mat lift box 
donkey face upward 
never mind corners fill ring money trifles wide pockets emptied golden shower amongst sifted handfuls dust floor anything else could find serve packing finally covering goat hair blanket took bed 
slowly found lid box nailed resting every strokes hammer whilst watched intent idle fashion wondering strange form madness 
length last nail driven seated box put hand inner pocket find note book incontinently fainted 
struggled feet sprinkled water face till revived rolled floor presently sank sleep torpor 
first lamp gave 
light japhet said maqueda dark place 
child kings answered man would obey could oil 
half hour later second lamp went 
light remained made arrangements could knowing soon darkness would us 
simple fetching jar two water placing arms ammunition hands spreading blankets lie side side upon one believed would bed death 
thus engaged japhet crawled circle outer gloom 
suddenly saw haggard face appear looking like spirit rising grave 
lamp burned moaned began fail whilst watch tunnel mouth half way died altogether 
wire thing speaks guided could never reached 
lost darkness city perished alone among ghosts 
well said oliver 
anything report nothing lord least little 
moved small rocks piled crept hole till came place blessed light day fell upon one little ray still light day 
think something fallen upon tunnel broken perhaps one outer walls palace 
least looked crack saw everywhere ruins ruins still smoke 
among heard voices men shouting 
one called companion strange gentiles child kings perished fire found bones would known guns carried 
friend answered strange indeed magicians perhaps hidden away somewhere 
part hoped sooner later would found put death slowly deserved led astray child kings brought many heaven descended abati death 
fearing lest find kill drew near could tell voices crept back story 
said nothing seemed nothing say sat sad circle watched dying lamp 
began flicker leaping like thing alive sudden panic seized poor japhet 
walda nagasta cried throwing feet called brave man brave sun stars shine 
dark amongst many angry spirits hunger gnawing bowels great coward joshua coward let us go light yet time 
let us give prince 
perhaps merciful spare lives least spare die sun shining us 
maqueda shook head whereon turned orme went lord would blood child kings upon hands thus repay love lead forth 
harm come otherwise must perish misery 
hear man says maqueda said orme heavily 
truth 
really matter us whether die power abati starvation fact think prefer former end doubtless hand laid 
go nay answered passionately 
hand would laid hand joshua rather touch die hundred deaths 
let fate take course told believe open us gate see 
believe vain another gate pass together oliver beyond gate lies peace 
bid man silent drive away 
let trouble 
lamp flame sank low 
flickered twice thrice time showing pale drawn faces us six seated like wizards making incantation like corpses tomb 
went 
long place least three whole days nights believe course soon lost count time 
first suffered agonies famine strove vain assuage great draughts water 
doubt kept us alive even higgs may remembered teetotaller afterwards confessed loathed sight taste water ever since 
indeed drinks beer wine like people 
torture could eaten anything 
fact professor manage catch eat bat got entangled red hair 
offered bite remember grateful declined 
worst also little food hard ship biscuits saved purpose namely feed maqueda 
managed 
certain intervals would announce time eat hand maqueda biscuit 
would pretend eat also saying much felt refreshed food longed smacking lips biting piece wood could help hearing us 
piteous farce went forty eight hours last wretched japhet quite demoralized mood acting betrayed us exactly remember 
maqueda would touch nothing greatly matter one biscuit left 
offered whereon thanked us courtesy toward woman took biscuit gave japhet ate like wolf 
time incident discovered japhet missing least could longer touch answer called 
therefore concluded crept away die sorry say thought little suffered suffered suffered also 
recall overtaken last sleep strange fit came upon us 
pangs passed away much pain mortification follows wound horrible craving nutriment
