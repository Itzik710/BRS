knew mother married lived long way 
knew also mother favorite barbara 
conversation gathered event something happening realize go live mother 
clare imaginative child topic dreams mysterious mother never seen 
many time barbara saw quietly dressing hushing doll clare mind work puzzling incomprehensible reason barbara evident dislike absent mother 
shocking thing could done thought clare make bab angry poisoned sister drowned cat stolen big crown queen head romance little child always incongruous sensational 
truth nothing sensational little commonplace character history little clare mother whose maiden name orige williams 
spoilt child wealthy old cornish gentleman pretty pet lavished love bounty never crossing cradle 
repaid children thus trained often crossing matter concerning much cared 
set heart marrying rich knight whose estate lay contiguous entirely self centred chose make runaway match young lieutenant avery whose whole year income equal one week father rent roll 
bitterly disappointed mr williams declared made bed lie one penny would ever bestow lived would bequeath bulk property nephew 
consequence threat reached ears orige romantic high flown fancied heroine martyr capacity either 
sort language delighted spoke friendless orphan sacrifice love truth honor 
never seemed occur deceiving father led believe last moment intended conform wishes acted untruthfully dishonourably love callous every shape except love self 
eighteen months walter orige avery lived bradmond time clare born 
weeks old summons came father rejoin ship 
gone two months news reached bradmond naval skirmish spaniards scilly isles great havoc made among queen forces list dead lieutenant walter avery 
orige romance took new turn 
pictured widowed nightingale love lorn desolate leaning bleeding breast upon thorn moaning forth melancholy lay 
others done since fancied poetical silly 
barbara took grim notice handkerchief perpetually going tearless eyes whit less particular usual know supper 
six whole months state things lasted 
orige arrayed deepest sables spoke wretched widow could never taste hope baby poor hapless orphan yet unwitting misery 
declined see visitors persisted miserable disconsolate taking lonely walks brood wretchedness 
end time electrified husband family one announcement marry 
love time course indeed thought duty 
sir thomas enville widower three children kind would make good father clare 
beautiful estate north 
would thousand pities let opportunity slip 
thought duty begged one would worry opposition everything already settled 
kate avery walter elder surviving sister exceedingly indignant 
gentle unsuspicious mother astonished puzzled

sir thomas liked adorn pretty plaything fine dresses rich jewellery surrounded every comfort allowed go every party within ten miles spend much money pleased 
precisely orige beau ideal happiness 
small cup seemed full evidently clare necessary ingredient compound 
one taken trouble weigh sort label prejudices barbara polwhele would found heaviest object papistry second dirt third mistress walter 
lieutenant avery barbara darling cradle considered widow outraged memory marrying short time death 
provocations barbara never heartily forgave 
great struggle keep feelings much possible background conscientious motive ought instil clare baby mind faintest feeling aversion towards mother 
idea child permanently sent enville court intensely distasteful 
yet wherever clare went barbara must go also 
promised mrs avery clare grandmother dying bed never leave child free long childhood lasted rather break word would gone siberia enville court 
barbara eyes would little choice two places 
enville court lay sea coast barbara abhorred sea brother walter avery died lancashire looked upon den witches arid desert bare comforts life long way large town barbara used live within easy walk one felt short though sent banishment

may added though blanche know father specially begged mr tremayne examine matter set blanche right points whereon might gone wrong 
thus brought stand forced action blanche nature behave manner mule predicament affect stronger contrary convictions really felt 
true said rather bluntly think little difference many doctrines held rival churches 
difference betwixt heaven earth answered mr tremayne 
nay well nigh said betwixt heaven hell believe devil perverter truth corruptions papistry

one honor ten thousand fold dearer unto heart maid honor god eternal father 
honor toucheth ready pay

would ask remember mistress blanche hath told us clean contrary 
blanche looked astonished expression 
whosoever shall father heaven brother sister mother

neither lady anne stanley set faintest claim succession though seymour least might done decided show justice law succession stood 
two royal wills king james scotland cousin lady arbella stuart entirely dispossessed claim made law stood unaltered henry eighth
