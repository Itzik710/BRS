thought proper solemnly relinquish violent pretensions parliament acknowledge neither one house houses independent king possessed military authority 
preamble statute went far renounce right even defensive arms king much observation made regard concession esteemed singular 
terms taken full literal sense imply total renunciation limitations monarchy privileges subject independent sovereign 
rights subsist without remedy still less rights exposed much invasion tyranny even ambition subjects must never resist follows every prince without effort policy violence rendered absolute uncontrollable sovereign needs issue edict abolishing every authority liberty moment effect annihilated 
meaning absurd impute present parliament though zealous royalists showed measures cast regard national privileges 
probably sensible suppose sovereign invasion public liberty entirely unconstitutional therefore expressly reserve upon event right resistance subject must liable objection
