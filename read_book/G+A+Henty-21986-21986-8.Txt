chapter iv 
back school 
long time many breaks read edgar letter end rupert madge could compose sufficiently accompany father drawing room 
broke met mother captain clinton said come must pull together see done talk whole matter calmly great effort recovered composure 
first place must try find edgar 
got twenty four hours start us much 
suppose think rupert doubt went town night train 
doubt got away time father course might gone train passes gloucester somewhere time 
think likely rupert 
say sure go london almost always goal people make unless case boys want go sea would make liverpool port 
think edgar likely 
think special fancy sea may assume gone london 
money five pound note sent three days ago father clear ticks pay journey home 
meant said taken note know grudge 
think pound left know note came said money enough last end term 
would five pound note untouched got london driven could get think six seven pounds watch chain 
would give enough keep little time 
couple years older say would probably enlist made minds go army 
although lads enlist proper age recruiting officer doctor would pass eighteen 
first thing advertise first place advertise offering reward information whereabouts second place advertising direct begging come home 
would never come father rupert said looking letter captain clinton still held hand 
would depend advertised 
suppose say statement woman believed much doubt 
others looked intense surprise 
oh father could say rupert exclaimed 
oh could say quite quite content know either us might son would matter much felt loved us equally could say rupert captain clinton said gravely still think great ground doubt 
really father oh pleased think yes sure could bear know edgar real son would different learn lips know love still instead hearing dreadful way edgar 
doubt father seemed reading letter certain 
really doubt percy mrs clinton asked 
indeed lucy give reasons 
first place woman left india weeks affair 
certainly could seen children returned england far know never seen since 
seen never spoken come sort contact therefore possibly known 
saw cheltenham rupert says week met upon every possible occasion stared hard 
evident therefore time doubtful 
doubt used trying detect resemblance 
years boys constantly watching ways listening voices could detect resemblance extremely improbable able merely seeing score times walking streets 
say impossible could done say extremely improbable think much likely finding could see resemblance whatever determined speak first might happen find alone 
mark father rupert said 
yes mark mrs clinton repeated 
know mark rupert 
wonder never noticed lucy 
tiny one father 
never noticed indeed hardly see glass rather back shoulder edgar noticed one day 
larger head good sized pin 
little dark brown mole 
perhaps smaller lighter baby must would known 
rupert mere fact way prove son 
see edgar says letter 
remember woman could known boys mark know say recognized likeness appears edgar letter 
says said one us small mole shoulder 
knew rupert tiny mole said mark knew son 
suppose edgar replied yes mark shoulder might said mark distinguish son captain clinton others silent 
mrs clinton said know percy wish prove one boys naturally woman would wish benefit boy boy mark told edgar made mistake rupert son suppose lucy cared slightest son main object course extort money 
edgar say anything course first would try make ready sacrifice would scarcely say expected make handsome allowance came property doubt motive 
well see already begun edgar 
suppose said made mistake rupert son 
edgar would gone told would probably telegraphed could get rupert woman saw would known story would upset altogether 
court law would attach weight might say 
would stand confessed concerned gross fraud lied first unless position produce corroborative evidence prove child mark word would go nothing 
feel sure could produce evidence 
mark almost invisible one never afterwards noticed 
shown women acquaintance would come forward change children took place pointed children could easily distinguished inasmuch child peculiar mark 
feel sure even husband knew nothing mark believe party fraud 
terribly upset whole business took drink afterwards 
continual quarrels wife left went england 
believe could pointed child would done 
certainly attached little weight woman story come 
turned house told go court dare claim custody son 
must known weakness position say opened matter edgar determined stick knowing boy taken thus sudden would likely believe whereas said son would find already prepared probably confront 
see rupert truthfully advertise woman story believed much doubt regarded us sons 
glad father rupert exclaimed excitedly 
oh edgar written first instead going straight away 
would better captain clinton said blame 
think natural go 
would thought written would seemed wanted something anything would seemed better 
however must set something

would like rupert go back morrow stay away end term take advice go back would pity miss examinations 
think could get examinations father mind besides say fellows edgar going away see find next term begins need say nothing 
would account run away rupert anyhow 
think better go back boy tell facts story 
slightest discredit would better edgar known went influence mistake sorts reasons assigned absence 
course occasion go full details

turn friendly companionship elder boy greatest value 
easton never said much way sympathy indeed would jarred rupert feelings kindness said words could rupert looked back felt ashamed thought often joined laugh 
home points seemed peculiar school unnoticeable 
scrupulous attention dress strong contrast general carelessness others respect seemed natural house good many guests staying 
rupert edgar always particular home school easton indeed rupert thought anything less particular river smith week christmas rupert received letter father written nice saying letter edgar forwarded home giving brief words lad said well might uneasiness respecting 
tell us much captain clinton went pleased inasmuch seems edgar mean altogether drop sight hope write time time let us know rate well 
letter london post mark course shows nothing may written anywhere sent anyone perhaps waiter hotel stopped london arranged post letters might inclose 
letter greatly cheered mother spite could say hitherto dread edgar distress might done something rash 
never thought instant 
trust two boys well principled brave act coward part whatever might befall 
mother course agreed theory admitted edgar would never senses thing urged distress might great would responsible 
happily morbid idea dissipated arrival letter great hopes rouse shake state silent brooding causing much anxiety 
morning received letter already looks brighter like done since brought us news edgar disappearance

known considerable force enemy metemmeh would augmented addition thousands arabs engaged previous day probable enemy aware advance force battle even serious desperate first would fought reaching nile 
object night march reach river aware column started wells 
nile gained supply water ensured force would able withstand attack made 
nevertheless would far better risked another battle open made night march across unknown country 
guides differed among route pursued column marched complete circle advance guard coming rear 
thick groves mimosa passed causing greatest confusion among baggage animals 
great numbers lay die unable proceed step transport kinds got mixed together utter confusion

pretty mess sergeant said 
hear anything row enough rear baggage heard miles away 
earth lad well marching nearly south 
southern cross almost dead ahead us 
better steer go ahead morning 
camels set motion hours plodded 
desire sleep completely dissipated excitement situation talked low tones could make signs column day broke 
agreed plan keep got river arrived would water camels give feed rest start foot along bank one way found column 
safe lot firing sergeant said even arabs discover force morning get river certain turn attack soon get 
judging pace going constant halts baggage come little chance column getting river daylight nothing delay us expect shall 
one respect better edgar said soon natives make column swarming country look stragglers whereas ahead may get river without noticed 
think long morning breaks know sergeant think camels going faster 
think lad 
looks getting near water smell 
first signs daybreak apparent east character country changed could make clumps trees light grew brighter cultivated ground 
ten minutes later gave shout joy mounting slight ascent river lay 
minutes later bank 
camels rushing put noses water riders slipped backs regardless fact water knee deep wading back shore threw edge took long draughts clear water 
throwing clothes rushed indulged bathe 
camels filling nearly bursting lay stream sergeant edgar went compelled return shore set work cropping long grass grew abundantly riders sat made meal contents haversacks 
well rate sergeant said nothing present 
troops may within mile may ten miles saying 
nothing us wait hear something 
hear anything shall know either struck river struck far hear guns 
case opinion may well rest day 
move think decidedly better take saddles camels hide bushes move away distance hide 
evidently cultivated country natives sure see camels better near 
fear animals straying eating drinking day 
saddles accordingly removed camels backs hidden two men went back hundred yards river lay amongst bushes 
edgar dropping sleep sergeant exclaimed listen 
edgar roused distinctly heard boom distant gun 
one seven pounders sergeant said think hear sound musketry sure 
presently however wind brought distinctly sound dropping shots 
skirmishing lad suppose enemy hovering come close quarters yet 
horrible instead edgar exclaimed rose feet 
use thinking moving lad four five miles away certainly arabs probably round slightest chance joining 
nothing wait 
sound comes inland certain got river yet 
far judge pretty nearly behind us lick fellows likely come river somewhere near point 
evening 
may sure got water enough last day must move forward however many natives may way 
like last business us almost knew coming flat country shall plenty warning bet year pay get square 
think lad get set bandages right 
edgar uttered exclamation alarm 
large dark patch sergeant trousers 
dressing bathe bandages shifted little bleeding recommenced 
evident edgar great deal blood lost sergeant bowen lay faint exhausted upon ground 
unknown action camel set wound bleeding night although said nothing edgar difficulty walked river hiding place 
edgar ran river two water bottles returned found companion insensible 
unbuttoned tunic got wound blood still flowing 
washed made plug wet linen difficulty bandaged tightly 
time sergeant opened eyes 
try move edgar said 
staunched bandaged wound better soon 
bad job lad present want 
nothing present sergeant 
wait quietly fellows come river soon get assistance 
hear firing still edgar replied listening attentively minute 
expect formed another zareba abu klea leave camels march straight river 
steal edge desert mind left alone bit 
shall able judge far 
lad right 
long away shall anxious 
edgar made way quarter mile back 
cultivated fields stretched beyond rolling hillocks desert 
could see men horseback foot moving looking right saw half mile distant place extent felt sure metemmeh 
numbers men pouring town 
firing straight ahead somewhat left 
attack metemmeh shall right said 
march straight river shall right still 
shall move along 
lucky strike river town would next impossible get round without observed 
went back companion told seen 
evidently going another tough fight get water sergeant said 
hard cut 
good fighting 
great desire another fight like last edgar said 
one go sort thing quite enough 
hours passed slowly 
sergeant slept good deal anxious edgar several times dozed 
presently exclaimed fire become much heavier sergeant nearer 
listen arabs lad sergeant said raising elbow 
heavy nothing like roll musketry hear fellows begin 
say much nearer column part march towards river 
five minutes later dull continuous rattle came ears 

stopped said minute later roar suddenly ceased 
happened wonder ah 
like steady even 
musketry came sudden crashes 
volleys sergeant said 
near 
three four minutes sounds continued silence 
beaten sergeant said 
let get near time expect 
would independent firing 
long hear volleys may sure fellows pressed 
beyond occasional shot firing ceased 
far think away sergeant four miles think two good bit away left 
making river establish tackle metemmeh 
half hour river edgar said 
wait time start get party bring 
better wait morrow morning lad 
well 
may able crawl time 
anyhow hands full afternoon 
make zareba river attend wounded perhaps send back force bring camels baggage doubt left behind spot firing morning 
grub enough haversacks last us morrow plenty water fetching 
think best sergeant 
shoulder smarting good deal shall better hours rest 
soon getting dusk go get another supply water good twelve hours sleep without fear called outpost duty 
got three four nights sleep make 
broad daylight awoke 
sergeant got feet evident edgar altogether unfit walking 
shall saddle camel sergeant lad stay 
like enough arabs swarming within gun shot camp 
obstinate beggars know fairly beaten 
active might manage get foot man camel would sure seen 
careful lad go 
remember seen lost fellows could run certainty chance get without noticed 
like leaving sergeant 
must leave lad 
food speak left dangerous morrow next day day 
besides duty corps 
every musket may needed sooner go sooner shall fetched 
well start edgar said 
first went river filled two water bottles placed sergeant side emptied little food remained haversack 
couple days anything occur prevent sending 
shall well lad 
shall thinking 
gladdest sound ever fell ears tramp infantry shall know got safely 
good bye lad god bless edgar wrung sergeant hand unable trust speak turned started wood 
gone far found grove means large one trees opened 
bore left hoping would extend along river bank 
grove isolated large patch cultivated land stretched river 
half mile another grove whether extensive means telling 
standing edge trees could see several figures horseback moving saw natives 
hussars want two three days rest expect said horses fit go drive fellows town 
well goes descended bank river low kept along shelter reached next grove 
seemed much safer would determined keep shelter bank reached camp 
gone hundred yards farther sudden exclamation bank almost instant spear struck helmet head 
turned round brought rifle shoulder moment arab bank joined score others loud yells rushed upon 
illustration good bye lad god bless saw fire ensure death resistance worse useless 
therefore threw gun held arms 
arabs rushed upon body uplifted spears swords order sharply given one seemed leader lowered 
edgar however knocked kicked beaten cords placed round body arms felt lifted carried away 
thrown wood animated seemed angry discussion carried time 
picked good many arabic words enough enable understand discussion doubt subject dispute whether killed carried away prisoner 
time lifted cords round legs taken hurried along many curses occasional sharp prick spear judged favor sparing life present day 
prospects seemed desperate time concerned thought man perhaps father lying helpless wood vainly expecting return 
consider case altogether hopeless 
soon troops assembled river bank would sure move forward metemmeh even pass wood sergeant might gain sufficient strength reach edge get sight join 
unless one alternatives took place lost 
could blame misfortune befallen 
taken seemed far safest course accident one arabs standing moment edge river would got safely 
captors evidently fear attacked 
probably column gone fetch baggage yet returned small force left zareba river bank would certainly undertake offensive operation came back 
sorry persisted opinion remained sergeant another day two scouting party might passed near grove concealed 
however might made difference 
arabs evidently swarming country parties would likely occupy wood occupied one nearer english camp 
approached village arabs raised shouts triumph crowd gathered entered street gesticulating screaming furiously edgar thought would torn pieces 
however captors forced way crowd turned street entered court yard center stood house larger size majority composed town 
edgar legs tied thrown outhouse lay hours 
could hear almost continuous talking house voices occasionally rose angry altercation 
surprised killed entered place arabs fought courage engaged abu klea must suffered heavily fell back friends relatives fallen would thirsting vengeance upon european fell power 
considered probable people metemmeh lived passage caravans river traffic would heart much opposed mahdi khartoum cities 
force british fought abu klea composed partly mahdi regular followers partly wild tribesmen animated alike mahommedan fanaticism hope plunder although might unite attack christians little love 
band whose hands fallen might townspeople probably members tribe summoned arrest progress troops going relief khartoum 
detained prisoner instead killed edgar felt strong chance 
couple days force might attack metemmeh case might rescued 
however place considerable size containing present large number fighting men losses column suffered first fight subsequent encounters general stewart might well hesitate risk still greater loss already suffered attack upon place 
probable mahdi would send large body troops besieging khartoum soon heard arrival small british force river every gun might needed maintain position repel attacks arrival reinforcements across desert 
thus edgar felt doubtful whether attack would made present 
course soon reinforcements arrived boat column came river metemmeh would captured time might hundreds miles away 
boat column might get round six weeks reinforcements coming across desert korti would march edgar felt sure would long time camels condition work 
well filled two water bottles use sergeant edgar taken long drink one came near dark suffered good deal thirst pain caused tightness bound 
began think altogether forgotten door outhouse opened two arabs came seizing package dragged court yard 
received two three kicks intimation could sit roped unable accomplish seeing men pulled wall raised sitting position 
fire burning center court yard 
cushions front sat man recognized leader party seized 
arabs squatted ground standing round 
chief past prime life still powerful sinewy man 
features prepossessing edgar looking round thought expression face less savage majority followers 
christian dog speak language prophet asked 
speak little arabic edgar replied inwardly congratulating upon trouble taken pick little language time egypt 
answer evidently satisfactory 
chief bowed head 
good said 
kaffir henceforth slave tents sheik bakhat jahrin tribe 
pointed edgar understood captor intended keep property rate present bowed head signify understood 
english foolish enough come sheik asked 
must know stand power mahdi 
come interfere mahdi bring back countryman gordon friends khartoum 
never reach khartoum sheik said 
bones whiten desert 
edgar reply partly knowledge arabic insufficient discussion partly worth run risk exciting anger chief pointing failed prevent thousand men crossing desert metemmeh might similarly fail preventing force seven eight times amount marching banks river khartoum 
therefore remained silent 
mahdi invincible sheik went pause 
conquer egypt destroy kaffirs take city rome capture constantinople turks deny authority 
mahdi great man edgar said gravely although difficulty repressing smile 
say may happen seeing answer also considered satisfactory went slave hungry thirsty 
wounded bonds hurt greatly 
use order food drink given chief nodded motion hand two followers freed edgar bonds dish containing boiled meal jug water placed beside 
edgar drank deeply able take mouthfuls food feverish considerable pain wound arm would comparatively slight proper attention paid inflamed angry arm greatly swollen 
attention paid returned outhouse took karkee tunic tearing strips wetted laid shoulder 
presently door closed heard heap brushwood thrown effectual way preventing attempt escape door opened outwards slightest movement would cause rustling bushes arouse arabs sleeping court yard 
window 
edgar seeing escape question laid tried sleep pain arm great hours succeeded 
next morning allowed go yard time attention paid 
considerable hubbub heard town much shouting yelling 
arab ran gate news 
edgar could understand hurried words effect evident 
men seized arms sheik order edgar securely bound fastened outhouse 
course hour heard firing first dropping shots two three sharp volleys knew british advancing town arabs gone skirmish 
long pause heard sound english field pieces 
listened musketry vain 
reconnaissance said 
little guns would batter mud walls round town without expense ammunition could afforded 
doubt troops could take storm surely general would risk heavy loss would suffer got especially place would use took must fall matter course rest force arrives 
opinion little disappointed firing ceased knew triumphant yells arabs british force retiring 
short time heard clamor voices court yard presently unbound released 
kaffirs dare attack place arab said exultantly 
gone back camp 
day two forces khartoum berber destroy make slaves 
four days later great firing muskets triumphant yelling streets 
edgar felt anxious fearing expected reinforcements arrived tremendous attack made upon camp 
believe already taken place felt confident every pain taken strengthen position whatever numbers assault might made would repulsed 
presently however sheik deigned tell cause rejoicing 
news khartoum said 
city taken englishman gordon followers killed 
news certain 
brought us tribesmen sides river 
told mahdi irresistible 
blow terrible one edgar 
first place grievous think expedition made vain owing authority home delaying months making minds rescue gordon failed object noblest englishmen left die unaided sent 
thought intense disappointment would felt troops grief would england news known wondered would done next 
evident position altogether changed 
felt confident unless captors moved away town arrival main body expedition rescued seemed altogether uncertain whether expedition would come 
long gordon alive england bound make every effort rescue companions dead khartoum fallen might feel called upon attempt reconquest soudan 
probable however would best end cheapest way difficulty 
force enormous expense brought almost within striking distance khartoum could relied upon make way thither defeat armies mahdi recapture khartoum without great difficulty 
provisions stores purchased brought scarce outlay additional already incurred would entailed operation 
upon hand retire would leave whole soudan hands mahdi fanatics 
would mean destruction settled government established egyptians would expose egypt incessant invasions bound repel 
common sense humanity even economy seemed favor advance force khartoum 
british people roused anger fate gordon would probably call loudly vindication national honor act retribution murderers gordon 
edgar felt another way difficulty might present authorities home 
unlikely counsels first expedition would prevail would retire egypt without striking another blow 
case seemed nothing lifelong slavery 
edgar however age hope easily relinquished 
may slave long time said sooner later escape 
get speak language like native 
already almost burnt color shall ere long able pass one 
hard indeed time manage escape make way either back egypt red sea abyssinia 
feel sure could either one would something would make kill
