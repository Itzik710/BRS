since name margeril mentioned marchioness become possible paler ever 
old gentleman last words rose said anxiously write sir would useless 
wish 
embarrassment evident others quite surprised

alas poor woman could speak suspicions darkened whole life marquis de boiscoran cruel penalty wife called upon pay slight imprudence 
absolutely necessary said half stifled voice last hope go see de margeril 
folgat one suspected painful antecedents might life marchioness harassed memory 
interposed therefore saying events advice await end preliminary investigation 
may mistaken however answer sent jacques desire lawyer alludes consulted 
certainly wisest plan said de chandore 
ringing servant sent magloire ask call dinner 
jacques de boiscoran chosen wisely 
magloire looked upon sauveterre eloquent skilful lawyer district whole province 
rarer still far glorious besides reputation unsurpassed integrity high sense honor 
well known would never consented plead doubtful cause told number heroic stories thrown clients window ill advised come money hand ask undertake unclean case 
naturally rich man preserved fifty four five habits frugal thrifty young man 
married quite young magloire lost wife months never recovered loss 
although thirty years old wound never healed regularly certain days seen wending way cemetery place flowers modest grave 
man would laughed thing sauveterre dared respected highly 
young old knew reverenced tall man calm serene face clear bright eyes eloquent lips well cut delicate lines turns glowed scorn tenderness disdain 
like dr seignebos magloire also republican last imperial elections bonapartists greatest trouble aided though whole influence government shrinking unfair means keep chamber 
would successful influence count claudieuse prevailed upon number electors abstain voting 
man towards nine clock presented upon invitation de chandore house anxiously expected inmates 
greeting affectionate time sad touched dionysia heart painfully 
thought saw magloire far believing jacques guilty 
mistaken magloire let see clearly delicate manner sure still leave doubt 
spent day court heard opinions members court means favorable accused 
circumstances would evidently grave blunder yield jacques wishes apply change venue galpin magistrate 
investigation last year cried dionysia since galpin determined obtain jacques confession crime committed 
magloire shook head replied believe contrary madam investigation soon concluded 
jacques keeps silent neither silence accused caprice obstinacy interfere regular process 
called upon produce justification refuses law proceeds without 
still sir accused person reasons reasons force man let accused unjustly 
even case foreseen 
accused liberty answer question may inculpate 
nemo tenetur prodere se ipsum 
must admit refusal answer justifies judge believing charges true accused refute 
great calmness distinguished lawyer sauveterre terrified listeners except folgat 
heard use technical terms felt chilled like friends wounded man hear grating noise surgeon knife 
son situation appears serious sir asked marchioness feeble voice 
said dangerous madam 
think folgat every day adds danger exposed sure 
de boiscoran really innocent ah magloire broke dionysia friend jacques say magloire looked young girl air deep sincere pity said precisely friend madam bound tell truth 
yes know appreciate noble qualities distinguish de boiscoran 
loved love still 
matter look mind heart 
jacques man judged men 
clear public absolute evidence guilt hand 
evidence offer innocence moral evidence 
god murmured dionysia 
think therefore honorable brother magloire bowed folgat 
think de boiscoran innocent adopted unfortunate system 
ah luckily alibi 
ought make haste great haste establish 
ought allow matters go till sent court 
accused three fourths condemned already 
looked crimson de chandore cheeks growing pale 
yet exclaimed jacques change system one knows mulish obstinacy might quite sure 
unfortunately made mind said dionysia magloire knows well see letter 
nothing said let sauveterre lawyer suspect communications opened prisoner 
letter alluded became necessary take confidence 
first astonished looked displeased told every thing said great imprudence daring looking folgat added profession certain rules broken without causing trouble 
bribe clerk profit weakness sympathy paris lawyer blushed imperceptibly 
said never advised imprudence committed feel bound insist upon abandoned even blamed mean profit 
magloire reply read jacques letter said de boiscoran disposal shall go soon longer close confinement 
think miss dionysia insist upon saying nothing 
however means reaching letter well ready profit imprudence committed beseech name interest name dear speak explain prove innocence 
thereupon magloire bowed withdrew suddenly leaving audience consternation evident left suddenly order conceal painful impression jacques letter produced upon 
certainly said de chandore write might well whistle

doctor first went close doors carefully putting cane broad brimmed hat upon table said nothing new 
still insist upon ruining de boiscoran order shrink nothing 
asked de chandore 
doctor shrugged shoulders contemptuously 
really doubt sir replied 
yet facts speak clearly enough 
department certain number physicians keenly alive honor profession tell truth consummate apes 
grave situation folgat could hardly suppress smile doctor manner extraordinary 
one apes went length ears thickness skin surpasses others 
well one court chosen associated 
upon subject desirable put check upon doctor 
de chandore therefore interrupted saying fine fine learned brother fully persuaded mission physician employed court justice say amen stories prosecution 
cocoleu idiot says galpin peremptorily

dr seignebos solemnly put spectacles replied coldly opinion fully developed report cocoleu idiotic 
chandore started proposition seemed monstrous 
knew cocoleu well seen wander streets sauveterre eighteen months poor creature spent doctor treatment 
cocoleu idiotic repeated 
dr seignebos declared peremptorily look convinced 
large flat face disproportionate mouth yellow tanned complexion thick lips defective teeth squinting eyes deformed head sway side side heavy supported neck body deformed spine crooked find stomach big pendent hands drop upon thighs legs awkward joints unusually large symptoms idiocy gentleman find cocoleu

studied cocoleu sufficiently taken confess openly 
avowal mine evidence cunning astute obstinacy wretched creatures capacity carry design 
year experience sent cocoleu away declaring certainly believing incurable 
fact want cured 
country people observe carefully shrewdly taken tell almost man cocoleu bad idiot

found exaggerating imbecility could live without work done 
taken count claudieuse clever enough show much intelligence necessary make endurable without compelled work 
word said de chandore incredulously cocoleu great actor 
great enough deceived replied doctor yes sir 
turning folgat went told learned brother taking hospital 
found cocoleu obstinate ever silence even galpin induced break 
efforts obtain word fruitless although evident understood well 
proposed resort quite legitimate means employed discover feigned defects diseases learned brother refused encouraged resistance galpin know upon ground 
asked countess claudieuse sent talent making talk 
galpin would permit 
happens almost daily two physicians employed experts differ opinions 
courts would great deal force agree 
appoint simply third expert whose opinion decisive 
necessarily done cocoleu case 
necessarily continued dr seignebos court appointed first ass associate second ass 
agree shall accused convicted ignorance presumption 
came therefore said ask de chandore render little service 
wanted two families chandore boiscoran employ influence obtain commission physicians outside possible paris appointed examine cocoleu report mental condition 
undertake said prove really enlightened men poor creature partly pretending imbecile obstinate speechlessness adopted order avoid answers would compromise 
first however neither de chandore folgat gave answer 
considering question 
mind said doctor shocked silence mind pray view adopted every reason hope new turn given whole case 
yes ground accusation might taken prosecution kept folgat thinking 
exactly commenced last makes ask whether discovery cocoleu rascality would rather injurious beneficial de boiscoran 
doctor furious 
cried like know nothing simple replied advocate 
cocoleu idiocy perhaps serious difficulty way prosecution powerful argument defense 
galpin say de boiscoran charges basing capital charge upon incoherent words creature void intelligence consequently irresponsible 
ah permit said dr seignebos 
de chandore heard every syllable 
permit doctor said 
argument cocoleu imbecility one pleaded beginning appeared said conclusive need looking 
doctor could find answer folgat went let contrary established cocoleu really knows says changed 
prosecution justified opinion faculty saying de boiscoran need deny longer 
seen witness 
arguments must struck dr seignebos forcibly remained silent least ten long seconds wiping gold spectacles pensive air 
really done harm jacques de boiscoran meant help man long doubt 
replied dry tone discuss gentlemen 
ask one question yes believe de boiscoran innocence believe fully replied two men 
gentlemen seems running risk trying unmask impostor 
young lawyer opinion 
prove cocoleu knows says replied would fatal unless prove time told falsehood evidence prompted others 
prove means prove obstinacy replying questions arises fear answers might convict perjury doctor would hear nothing 
said rather uncourteously lawyer quibbles know one thing truth 
always tell murmured lawyer 
yes sir always replied physician always hazards whatever may happen 
de boiscoran friend still friend truth 
cocoleu wretched impostor firmly convinced duty unmask 
dr seignebos say probably confess personal matter cocoleu 
thought cocoleu taken cause host small witticisms suffered cruelly though allowed one see 
unmask cocoleu would given revenge return upon enemies ridicule overwhelmed 
made mind said whatever may resolve mean go work try obtain appointment commission 
might prudent folgat said consider thing consult magloire 
want consult magloire duty calls 
grant us twenty four hours hope 
dr seignebos frowned till looked formidable 
hour replied go daubigeon commonwealth attorney 
thereupon taking hat cane bowed left dissatisfied possible without stopping even answer de chandore asked count claudieuse according reports town getting worse worse 
hang old original cried de chandore doctor left passage 
turning folgat added must however confess received great news brought rather coldly 
fact news grave replied advocate made wish time consider 
cocoleu pretends imbecile least exaggerates incapacity confirmation de boiscoran last night told miss dionysia 
would proof odious trap long premeditated vengeance 
turning point affair evidently 
de chandore bitterly undeceived 
said think refuse support dr seignebos certainly honest man young lawyer shook head 
wanted twenty four hours delay must absolutely consult de boiscoran 
could tell doctor right take miss dionysia secret right murmured de chandore right

folgat dictated certain questions ask prisoner 
hastened write cipher four clock letter sent mechinet clerk 
next evening answer came 
dr seignebos doubt right dear friends wrote jacques
