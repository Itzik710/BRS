year later father died 
vincent nearly sixteen years old would upon coming age assume reins power orangery mother however would actual mistress long lived 
four years vincent passed english school done much render institution slavery repugnant father many serious talks last year life shown good deal said upon sides subject 
good plantations bad plantations vincent many good ones bad ones 
brutes found everywhere 
bad masters southern states bad landlords every european country 
even self interest alone planter greater reason caring health comfort slaves english farmer caring comfort laborers 
slaves valuable property worked badly cared decrease value 
whereas laborer falls sick unable work farmer simply hire another hand 
much interest planter keep slaves good health spirits farmer feed attend horses properly 
two consider slave fairly kind master full happy ordinary english laborer 
certainly work hard ill carefully attended well fed cares anxieties whatever old past work fear workhouse staring face 
time quite ready grant horrible abuses possible laws connected slavery 
selling slaves say breaking families selling separately horrible abominable 
estate sold together slaves upon would hardship matter estate changes hands england laborers upon work new master instead old 
liberate slaves estate morrow send north think would way benefited change 
would still work living naturally indolent shiftless would probably fare much worse 
selling families separately use lash set face strongly 
time boy whatever sentiments may subject must keep mouth closed 
owing attempts northern abolitionists come stirring slaves discontent advisable indeed absolutely dangerous speak slavery southern states 
institution must make best 
people sore foul slanders published northern writers 
many atrocities perpetrated undoubtedly brutes would brutes wherever born collect series atrocities string together story hold mrs beecher stowe picture slave life southern states gross libel anyone make collection wife beatings assaults drunken english ruffians publish picture average life english people 
libels done embitter two sections america anything else 
therefore vincent advice always kind slaves indulgent like children indulgence spoils time firm kind people avoid entering discussions expressing opinion regard slavery 
good much harm 
take things find make best 
trust time may come slavery abolished hope sake slaves done done gradually thoughtfully otherwise would inflict terrible hardship suffering upon well upon masters 
many conversations father son feeling subject ran high southern states former felt utmost importance son avoid taking strong line matter 
among old families virginia indeed far less feeling subject states 
knowing good feeling almost universally existed slaves gentry virginia regarded contempt calumnies subject 
secure affection slaves affection afterward abundantly proved course war scarcely saw ugly side question 
worst masters smallest ones man owned six slaves far apt extort utmost possible work planter owned three four hundred 
worst masters made little money trade speculation towns purchased dozen slaves small piece land tried set gentry 
virginia life large planters almost patriarchal one indoor slaves treated extreme indulgence permitted far higher degree freedom remark familiarity case servants english household 
nurses companions owners children grown regarded regarded almost part family 
course less connection planters field hands also part born estate children taught look white masters mistresses receive many little kindnesses hands 
cared sickness knew would provided old age 
little allotment could raise fruit vegetables fowls use sale leisure time 
fear loss employment pressure want ever present english laborers never fallen upon 
climate lovely one work far less severe men forced toil cold wet winter summer 
institution slavery assuredly capable terrible abuses marked many instances abominable cruelty oppression taken negroes well ordered estate kind masters probably happier class people laborers upon estate europe 
jonas pearson overseer time major wingfield authority time comparatively small major personally supervised whole working estate greatly liked slaves whose chief affections however naturally bestowed upon mistress childhood brought midst 
major wingfield liked overseer never ground justify making change 
jonas northern man always active energetic major wingfield orders strictly punctually carried although disliked man employer acknowledged excellent servant 
major death jonas pearson naturally obtained greatly increased power authority 
mrs wingfield great confidence accounts always clear precise although profits estate quite large husband lifetime always satisfactorily explained fall prices part crops affected weather 
flattered managed estate times rode made suggestions issued orders fits starts although jonas came two three times week house nominally receive orders managed adroitly believed everything done directions reality followed suggestions first place came 
aware however less content happiness estate old times 
complaints reached time time overwork harsh treatment 
upon inquiring matters jonas always plausible reasons give convinced right fault among slaves tried take advantage fact longer master eye upon accordingly tried shirk work throw discredit upon man looked interests mistress gradually mrs wingfield left management affairs hands jonas relied implicitly upon 
overseer spared pains gain good vincent 
latter declared horse rode sufficient life spirit jonas set inquiries foot selected horse speed bottom superior state 
one mrs wingfield acquaintances however upon hearing purchased animal told notorious vicious temper spoke angrily jonas subject presence vincent 
overseer excused saying certainly heard horse high spirited needed good rider thought selecting known mr vincent first class rider would care horse child could manage 
praise undeserved 
gentlemen virginia celebrated good riders major wingfield cavalry man anxious vincent maintain credit english blood placed pony soon able sit one 
pony kept use holidays uncle england upon return vincent except hours spent father almost lived horseback either riding estate paying visits houses planters 
hour everyday exercised father horses paddock near house major wheeled easy chair superintending riding 
horses little full spirit vincent powers often taxed utmost many falls soil light learned knack falling easily constant practice able age fourteen stick firmly even without saddle absolutely fearless animal mounted 
two years followed kept riding 
every morning breakfast rode richmond six miles distant put horse stable spent three hours school rest day would often ride schoolfellows also come distance return home till late evening 
vincent took english father rather virginia mother appearance character likely become tall brawny man former first love virginia heiress 
full life energy respect offered strong contrast schoolfellows age 
although splendid riders keen sportsmen planters virginia respects inclined indolence result partly climate partly waited upon childhood attendants ready carry every wish 
father cheerful disposition good temper together decisive manner frequently acquired service army time something warmth enthusiasm virginia character 
good rider somewhat surprised horse overseer selected 
certainly splendid animal great bone power mistaking expression turned back eye ears lay almost flat head anyone approached 
splendid animal doubt jonas said first time inspected certainly looks beast temper 
fear told mother exaggeration mr markham told day rode son said bought wildfire friend kept week vicious brute ever saw 
sorry bought sir jonas said 
course done heard things told one finest horses country little tricky price reasonable thought great bargain 
see wrong right mount think best send saturday market let go fetch 
see sir three four years older would different naturally age like ride horse 
give without trial vincent said shortly 
finest horse ever saw temper would cheap five times sum gave 
ridden good many bad tempered horses friends last year worst get 
well sir course please jonas said please remember harm comes strongly advised anything best dissuade trying 
vincent nodded carelessly turned black groom 
jake get cavalry saddle father high cantle pommel rolls knees 
like armchair one stick one deserves thrown 
groom putting saddle vincent stood patting horse head talking taking rein led inclosure 
want whip said jake offered one 
got spurs likely enough horse temper may spoiled knocking whip try kindness first 
like look massa vincent debble hoss dat 
think nice temper jake people learn control temper see horses rate try 
looks appreciates patted spoken already 
course treat horse like savage become savage 
stand way 
gathering reins together placing one hand upon pommel vincent sprang saddle without touching stirrups sat minute two patting horse neck 
wildfire apparently disgusted allowed mounted suddenly lashed viciously two three times refused move 
half hour vincent tried effect patient coaxing vain 
well fair means must foul vincent said last sharply pricked spurs 
wildfire sprang air began desperate series efforts rid rider rearing kicking quick succession seemed half time air 
finding efforts unavailing subsided last sulky immovability 
vincent tried coaxing patting success attended efforts applied spur sharply 
time horse responded springing forward like arrow bow dashed top speed across inclosure cleared high fence without effort set across country 
attempted take bit teeth sharp jerk drove spurs vincent defeated intention 
attempt check guide keeping light hand reins let go course 
vincent knew long horse going full speed could attempt trick unseat therefore sat easily saddle 
six miles wildfire continued course clearing every obstacle without abatement speed delighting rider power jumping qualities 
occasionally course taking would led obstacles impossible best jumper surmount vincent attempted put slightest pressure upon one rein direct easier point 
end six miles horse speed began slightly abate vincent abstaining use spurs pressed knees spoke cheerfully urging forward 
time time bent forward patted another six miles kept going speed almost great started 
allowed gradually slacken pace last first gallop trot ceased broke walk 
fine gallop old fellow vincent said patting nothing lose temper next road come upon turn face homeward 
half dozen lessons like doubt shall good friends 
journey home performed walk vincent talking greater part time horse 
took good deal six lessons wildfire would start without preliminary struggle master end kindness patience conquered 
vincent often visited horse stables taking apple pieces sugar spent time talking petting 
never carried whip never used spurs except forcing make first start 
horse naturally ill tempered vincent would probably failed happened afterward learn first owner hot tempered passionate young planter instead patient beat head rendered restive bad tempered 
vincent laid aside whip mounting first time probably would never effected cure 
fact animal longer fear old enemy whip much general course kindness good treatment effected change behavior 
vincent established good understanding wildfire altercation overseer found flog young negro dan 
pearson sent lad half hour message slaves work end estate found sitting ground watching tree discovered possum 
dan deserved punishment undoubted 
present regular employment upon estate 
jake father head stables dan made useful odd jobs horses expected become one regular stable hands 
overseer opinion already negroes stable could find employment urged upon mrs wingfield one hands boy dan sent fields 
however refused 
know quite right jonas say 
always four hands stable father time always though know easy time certainly like send fields 
dan think 
father age used lead pony first took riding vacancy dan must come stable 
could think sending field hand first place father sake still vincent 
dan used told see vincent get mischief little boy run messages special boy since came back 
vincent wanted regular house servant would broken old sam heart father boy husband another taken place vincent dan remained stable regarding vincent special master carrying messages friends odd jobs might require spending small portion time sleep 
thus object special dislike overseer first place succeeded way regard second useless hand overseer loved get much work possible everyone estate 
message somewhat important one wanted slaves work urgently required lost temper would done act would certainly bring collision vincent 
well aware lad really like efforts gain good failed foreseen sooner later would struggle power 
however relied upon influence mrs wingfield upon fact life owner orangery believed would able maintain position even vincent came age 
vincent side objected overseer treatment hands heard good deal dan already remonstrated mother subject 
however gained nothing 
mrs wingfield replied young interfere matters english ideas would virginia naturally slaves set overseer pearson longer master support obliged severe enforce obedience 
time vexed heart severity orangery estate best relations always prevailed masters slaves spoken jonas subject 
given answer given son slaves work master mrs wingfield way stranger 
set severe get work 
course wish like case must another overseer 
see fine estate going ruin 
believe abolition fellows getting among mischief bad spirit growing among 
assure lenient possible 
work must make long stay 
overseer way 
knew man good servant estate kept excellent order 
severities heard complaints means excessive expected northern overseer could rule entirely kindness owner estate could 
change would inconvenient would difficulty suiting well another time 
besides man sixteen years believed devoted interests 
therefore turned deaf ear vincent remonstrances 
always somewhat opposed left england school urging would learn ideas would clash people among life spent still considered views justified result 
overseer first give version story dan conduct going house vincent found sisters rosa annie garden returned two days visit friends richmond stayed chatting listening news hour meantime jonas gone seen mrs wingfield told story 
think mrs wingfield said finished better leave 
quite evident authority hands son interfere punish slave act gross disobedience neglect 
found tobacco required turning done afternoon owing orders carried tobacco improbably injured quality 
position difficult enough slaves see instead supported thwarted son authority gone altogether 
overseer carry work properly circumstances 
see matter jonas mrs wingfield said decidedly 
assured entire support see son interfere 
therefore vincent entered house began complaint found cut short 
heard story already vincent

dare say mother difficulty spoken go tell 
vincent found mother sitting left 
although sided jonas grievous hear complaints treatment slaves orangery

vincent satisfied 
chapter ii 
buying slave 
mrs wingfield talk matter overseer things went consequence smoothly 
vincent however adhered wish arranged soon could get nomination go west point american army sandhurst woolwich england 
could done however great political agitation sprang 
slave states greatly excited prospect republican president chosen republicans great extent identified abolition movement public feeling time run high became intensified time approached election new president threats democrats beaten republican elected slave states would secede union freely indulged 
virginia one northern slave states opinion somewhat divided strong minority extreme measures taken 
among vincent friends however part sons planters democratic feeling strongly ascendant sympathies wholly southern states 
right secede assumed unquestionable 
point fact great deal said sides 
states first entered union considered separate sovereign states possessing power authority manage affairs forming federation order construct central power operate effect mother country 
two years later constitution united states framed state giving certain portion authority reserving self government whatever rights specifically resigned 
mention made constitution right state secede union insisted state right secede chose declared right reserved opponents affirmed case could never contemplated 
thus question absolute right never settled became purely one force 
early november became known election mr lincoln republican candidate assured th month representatives south carolina met charleston unanimously authorized holding state convention meet third week december 
announcement caused great excitement considered certain convention would pass vote secession thus bring debated question issue 
although opinion virginia less unanimous southern states generally thought would imitate example south carolina 
day following receipt news vincent ridden plantations several friends talk matter returning homeward heard sound heavy blows whip loud curses moment later shrill scream woman voice rose air 
vincent checked horse mechanically exclamation anger 
knew well going beyond screen shrubs grew side fence bordering road 
moment hesitated muttering use touch horse whip gallop shriek rose louder agonizing 
cry rage vincent leaped horse threw reins top fence climbed moment burst way shrubbery 
close negro held four others two hold wrist holding arms extended full length white lad two years vincent senior showering blows heavy whip upon 
slave back already covered weals blood flowing several places 
yards distant black girl baby arms kneeling ground screaming mercy slave 
vincent burst bushes young fellow irritated cries turned round delivered tremendous blow whip bare shoulders 
time cry came lips slave stood immovable punishment inflicted upon made desperate effort break men held 
unsuccessful whip could fall woman shoulders vincent sprang forward seizing wrested hands striker 
oath fury surprise sudden interruption young fellow turned upon vincent 
coward blackguard andrew jackson vincent exclaimed white anger 
disgrace virginia ruffian without word young planter mad rage interference rushed vincent latter learned use fists english school riding exercises strengthened muscles opponent rushed met blow shoulder sent staggering back blood streaming lips 
rushed forward heavy blows exchanged closed grappled 
minute swayed fro although much taller young planter stronger vincent last came ground crash vincent uppermost jackson head fell coming force low stump lay insensible 
contest sudden furious none attempted interfere 
indeed negroes astonished moved moment vincent made appearance upon scene 
lad rose feet 
better carry house throw water said negroes turned away 
slave flogged broke others indeed loosened hold ran vincent threw knees taking lad hand pressed lips 
afraid done much good vincent said 
none better interference help 
saying made way shrubbery cleared fence mounted rode homeward 
fool said rode along 
worse poor beggar afterward still could help 
wonder row 
much expect jacksons stand well would good people round besides think jackson would like go court complain thrashed fellow head shorter 
blackguards like give abolitionists right hold slave owners tyrants brutes 
jacksons newcomers virginia 
six years estate cedars place called formed part put sale 
large one divided several portions suit buyers cedars purchased jackson successful storekeeper charleston decided upon giving business leaving south carolina settling landowner state 
antecedents however soon known richmond old virginian families turned cold shoulder newcomer 
man pleasant manners would gradually made way evidently gentleman 
habits trade stuck short time rumors slaves bought property found harsh cruel master 
would sufficient bring disrepute virginia rule slaves treated great kindness indeed considered position infinitely superior poorer class whites 
andrew jackson months school vincent unpopular rumors current treatment slaves estate known nickname slave driver 
vincent son white trader small cultivator knew well enough position would serious one would ride border state speed 
would denounced abolitionist would accused stirring slaves rebellion masters crime serious kind southern states 
placed heir great estate worked slaves cry could hardly raised 
might doubtless fined admonished interfering master slave sympathy better classes virginia would entirely 
vincent therefore little concerned doubted greatly whether interference done much harm good slave wife upon andrew jackson would vent fury 
rode direct stables instead alighting usual door

therefore decided upon borrowing boat friend next morning rode plantation father harry furniss convenient position pamunky one branches york river 
using sailboat present harry wish would let use week 
pleasure vincent fishing lines nets well like 
seldom use boat

chapter v secession 
vincent occupied affairs tony wife public events moved forward rapidly 
south carolina convention met third week december th month ordinance secession passed 
th january three days vincent returned home expedition florida followed example south carolina seceded 
alabama mississippi passed ordinance secession following day georgia th louisiana texas st february 
states ordinance secession received great rejoicings bonfires lit towns illuminated militia paraded streets many cases federal arsenals seized federal forts occupied state troops 
meantime northern slave states virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri remained irresolute 
general feeling strongly favor southern brethren anxious peace compromise arrived 
whether north would agree admit constitutional right secession whether would use force compel seceding states remain union still uncertain idea civil war terrible one general belief arrangement allow states go way would probably arrived 
time idea vincent going west point abandoned 
among acquaintances several young men already west point returned academy 
feeling strongly side secession 
great majority students came southern states sons northern men went principally trade commerce southern planters sent sons army great proportion officers army navy southerners 
professors west point military men feeling among well among students favor state rights considering according constitution allegiance due first states natives second place union 
thus many professors natives seven states seceded resigned appointments returned home occupy drilling militia levies called arms 
still hoped peace would preserved th april general beauregard commanded troops south carolina summoned major anderson command federal troops fort sumter surrender refusal opened fire upon fort following day 
th barracks fort set fire major anderson seeing hopelessness prolonged resistance surrendered 
effect news throughout united states tremendous mr lincoln called men militia various states put rebellion border states ordered send proportion 
brought matters climax 
virginia north carolina kentucky tennessee missouri refused furnish contingents act southern states virginia north carolina days later passed ordinances secession joined southern states 
missouri maryland delaware divided counsels 
struggle commence uneven one 
white population seceding states northern states 
north possessed immense advantage inasmuch retained whole federal navy thereby enabled cut communication southern states europe could draw unlimited supplies munitions war kinds across atlantic 
although people virginia hoped last peaceful arrangement might effected act secession received enthusiasm 
demand mr lincoln furnish troops crush southern brethren excited livliest indignation virginia felt course open throw lot slave states 
militia called volunteers called form provisional army protect state invasion north 
appeal answered enthusiasm men ages took arms wealthy raised regiments expense generally handing commands experienced army officers taking places ranks thousands lads fifteen sixteen years age enrolled men never done day work lives prepared suffer hardships campaign private soldiers 
mrs wingfield enthusiastic supporter state rights vincent told numbers friends going enroll soon lists opened offered objection

vincent often employed carrying dispatches major ashley stuart selected duty best mounted man troop

sometimes riding thirty forty miles getting occasional news stuart passed ahead would learn outpost colonel ten minutes ridden came vincent turn horse gallop back seldom succeeding overtaking active commander latter halted supper one villages men stationed 
sometimes good luck came upon earlier reading dispatch stuart would riding direction ashley command lay bid ride would chat terms friendly intimacy people knew richmond details work sometimes would sit together shade trees take contents haversacks share dinners

meal strolled see going 
evidently movement contemplation 
officers riding dashing general headquarters 
two three regiments seen marching plateau encamped town 
bells rang drums beat presently long trains railway wagons heavily laden began make way across bridge 
next morning movement continued unceasingly time military stores public property together much private property belonging inhabitants decided forsake homes time rather remain town occupied enemy could carried available wagons taken across bridge 
party engineers night hard work set fire railway bridge across river public buildings town 
main body troops moved across evening 
rearguard passed readiness destruction bridge 
general johnston preparing movement time foreseen position must evacuated soon enemy began advance upon either flanks considerable portion baggage military stores time previously sent interior virginia 
troops formed high grounds south river looked silence dense volumes smoke rising 
reality war 
hitherto military work many accustomed called militia state scene destruction gazed brought home struggle serious one war stern reality begun 
troops set march night bivouacked woods around charleston 
next day pushed across country took position covering winchester enemy finding johnston army front ready dispute advance recrossed river johnston concentrated force round winchester 
vincent joined corps afternoon infantry marched harper ferry general sending forward dispatches soon troops got motion 
find colonel stuart front enemy tell 
quite enough vincent found cavalry scouting close patterson force prepared attack enemy cavalry advance reconnoiter country blow bridges across streams fell trees take every possible measure delay advance patterson army attempt push toward winchester arrival general johnston force upon scene 
glad see back wingfield major ashley said rode 
colonel tells dispatch got last night johnston general said stuart information reached remarkably short time carried great speed orderly charge duty 
scarcely saddles since left 
however think use busy round enemy since arrived afternoon fancy must think us good deal stronger 
rate pushed cavalry forward say johnston morrow afternoon winchester safe anyhow 
federals recrossed river johnston taken position round winchester cavalry returned old work scouting along potomac 
th june movements considerable bodies enemy noticed johnston dispatched jackson brigade martinsburg orders send much rolling stock railroad could removed winchester destroy rest support stuart cavalry advanced 
number locomotives sent winchester along highroad drawn teams horses 
forty engines three hundred cars burned destroyed jackson advanced took position road williamsport cavalry camp little advance 
pleasant vincent duty spent time friends schoolfellows jackson brigade 
july scouts rode camp news strong force advancing williamsport 
jackson advanced th virginia infantry numbering men one gun stuart cavalry started make circuitous route harassed flank rear enemy 
intention part jackson fighting battle orders merely feel enemy whose strength far great withstood even brought whole brigade action numbered three brigades infantry cavalry artillery 
hours little confederate force skirmished boldly checked advance enemy whose general naturally supposed advanced guard strong force therefore moved forward great caution 
confederates threatened flanks masses federals fell back good order 
loss trifling either side fact small force hours checked advance army greatly raised spirits confidence confederates 
stuart small cavalry force coming upon enemy rear captured good many prisoners colonel stuart capturing forty four infantry 
riding distance ahead troop find position enemy came upon company federal infantry sitting field idea whatever confederate force neighborhood 
stuart hesitate moment riding shouted order throw arms dead men believing surrounded federals threw arms confederate cavalry came marched prisoners 
jackson reaching camp struck tents sent rear formed whole brigade order battle 
federals however instead attacking continued flank movement jackson fell back martinsburg halted night mile beyond town 
next day retired joined six miles johnston whole force 
four days little army held position prepared give battle enemy advanced federals though greatly superior numbers remained immovable martinsburg johnston great disgust troops retired winchester 
soldiers longing meet invaders battle general bear mind force command might moment urgently required join main confederate army aid opposing northern advance upon richmond 
stuart cavalry kept constantly informed strength enemy gathering front 
making circuits round martinsburg learned farmers number troops day came along federals knew nothing force opposed believed far outnumbered general johnston knew patterson force numbered men joined men since arrived winchester 
th july telegram government richmond announced federal grand army driven general beauregard pickets manassas begun advance johnston directed possible hasten assistance 
earthworks thrown winchester guns mounted upon town left protection local militia 
stuart cavalry posted long line across country prevent news movement reaching enemy 
soon done infantry strong marched 
troops high spirits knew long period inactivity although ignorant march meet enemy 
wagons rations need speed urgent even permit food cooked 
without halt pressed forward steadily two days march exhausted half famished reached manassas gap railroad 
put trains fast could prepared noon th joined beauregard manassas 
cavalry performed duty preventing news movement reaching enemy infantry nearly day march away stuart reassembled men followed johnston 
thus confederate plans completely successful 
enemy instead line battle main army detained winchester little confederate force facing reached beauregard time take part approaching struggle 
north doubt power grand army make way richmond entertained 
troops armed best weapons obtainable artillery numerous excellent army well fed confident men success regarded whole affair light great picnic 
grand army numbered men nine regiments cavalry forty nine rifle guns 
oppose confederate force arrival johnston army numbered infantry thirty five smooth bore guns cavalry 
many infantry armed shot guns old fowling pieces guns small ill supplied ammunition 
sharp fighting th federal advance across river bull run sharply repulsed therefore generals determined instead making direct attack st confederate position take wide sweep round cross river higher falling upon confederate left flank crumple 
night federal troops marched daybreak st nearly men position left flank confederates 
latter taken surprise stuart cavalry brought news federal movement general beauregard instead moving troops toward threatened point sent orders general longstreet right cross river soon battle began fall upon federal flank rear 
movement carried destruction federal army would probably complete one unfortunate accidents frequently occur war upset best laid plans order way never came hand late day error discovered late remedy 
eight clock morning two federal divisions reached river one engaged confederate force stationed bridge another crossed river ford 
colonel evans commanded confederate forces numbered fifteen companies left men continue hold bridge hurried oppose general hunter division crossed ford 
consisted infantry cavalry artillery another division equal force crossed red house ford higher 
check great force handful men seemed impossible colonel evans determined hold ground last enable general bring enforcements 
force consisted men south carolina louisiana contested every foot ground 
regiment formed advance federals charged supported artillery fire repulsed 
heavy federal line advanced however confederates slowly steadily pressed back general bee four regiments battery artillery came assistance 
newcomers threw fight great gallantry maintained ground almost annihilated fire enemy outnumbered five one 
fighting desperately fell back hunter division federals crossed red house ford suddenly poured took flank 
swept terrible musketry fire troops could longer resist spite efforts general rode among imploring stand firm aid arrived began fall back 
neither entreaties commands avail troops done could broken disheartened retreated great confusion 
moment seemed lost line glittering bayonets seen coming hill behind general riding haste toward found jackson advancing first brigade 
unmoved rush fugitives brigades bee evans jackson moved steadily forward firm resolute demeanor bee rode men pointing sword first brigade shouted look jackson standing like stone wall general words repeated henceforth brigade known stonewall brigade general nickname stonewall jackson ever afterward known 
greater part fugitives rallied took position right jackson federal forces hurrying forward assured victory found confronted suddenly bayonets 
moment pause pressed forward artillery preparing way tremendous fire 
jackson ordered men lie enemy arrived within fifty yards charge bayonet 
moment generals johnston beauregard arrived spot seeing desperate nature situation whole federal army pressing forward single brigade best prepare meet storm 
first galloped disordered lines bee exhorting men stand firm seizing colors th alabama johnston led forward formed fire 
beauregard hurried enforcements formed left jackson thus infantry artillery stuart two troops cavalry stood face face infantry seven troops regular cavalry behind lower fords men reserve 
men lying awaiting attack jackson rode backward forward front calm unconcerned appearance parade ground quiet bravery greatly nerved encouraged young troops 
tremendous artillery fire enemy ceased infantry came massive lines 
four confederate guns poured fire withdrew behind infantry 
line came within fifty yards jackson gave word men sprang feet poured heavy volley charged 
wild yell rose ranks closed mingled desperate conflict 
time wild confusion ardor courage jackson men prevailed burst center federal line 
immediately jackson charged beauregard sent forward rest troops time tremendous struggle took place along whole line 
generals bee barlow fell mortally wounded head troops 
general hampton wounded many colonels fell 
numerous federals although jackson pierced center masses drove back flanks threatened surround 
voice example cheered men hold ground officers closed ranks thinned enemy fire hour struggle continued without marked advantage either side 
jackson calmness unshaken even excitement fight 
one time officer rode another portion field exclaimed general think day going us jackson replied usual curt manner think sir better say anything 
resolute stand confederates enabled general beauregard bring fresh troops last gave word advance 
jackson brigade rushed forward receiving order burst federals engaged supported reserves drove enemy plateau 
federals though vastly superior force brought reserves prepared renew attack fresh men army shenandoah came upon field battle smith early brought divisions river whole southern line advanced charge drove enemy slopes toward ford 
panic seized regiments broke took headlong flight soon became utter rout 
many continued flight hours time federal army ceased exist confederates advanced jackson desired washington would fallen hands without blow struck defense 
first great battle war sometimes known battle manassas generally bull run 
exception one two charges little body confederate horse take part battle bull run 
aware utter stampede northern troops could safely pressed forward hot pursuit far washington numerically inferior federal cavalry ignorance northern infantry become mere panic stricken mob would imprudent extreme handful cavalry undertake pursuit army 
many confederates opinion decisive victory would end war north seeing south able well willing defend position taken would abandon idea coercing submission 
hope speedily dissipated 
north indeed alike astonished disappointed defeat army greatly inferior force instead abandoning struggle set work retrieve disaster place field force would believed prove irresistible

chapter vii 
merrimac monitor 
weeks vincent able walk unaided 
convalescence somewhat slow shock system severe one 
long railway journey injurious bandage become somewhat loose broken pieces bone grated upon much longer knitting together would treated spot 
soon could walk became anxious rejoin troop doctor said many weeks must elapse would able undergo hardships campaign 
reconciled extent delay letters friends troop perusal papers 
nothing whatever virginia 
two armies still faced northerners protected strong fortifications thrown round washington fortifications much formidable attacked confederates held force immensely superior numbers arms 
northerners indeed hard work collecting organizing army crush rebellion 
general scott succeeded mcclellan supreme command new general indefatigable organizing vast masses men raised north 
great efforts months defeat bull run north men arms 
move present made virginia sharp fighting border states especially missouri kentucky public opinion much divided regiments raised sides 
various operations undertaken federal fleet points along coast several important positions taken occupied impossible confederates defend long line seacoast 
south lost rather gained ground consequence victory bull run 
time unduly elated altogether disposed underrate enemies believe struggle good 
thus made effort corresponding north time went saw vastness preparations made conquest people southern states bestirred 
owing north command sea shutting principal ports rely upon everything north could draw arms ammunition requisites war markets europe 
foundries accordingly established manufacture artillery factories muskets ammunition percussion caps 
south fact manufacture everything cloth soldiers uniforms leather shoes past relied wholly upon north goods time impossible supply troops even necessary articles 
women throughout states set work spinning weaving rough cloth making uniforms 
leather however produced indeed efforts confederate authorities never throughout war able provide sufficient supply boots troops many battle soldiers fought almost barefooted reshod part stripping boots dead foes 
many articles could produced southern states confederates suffered much want proper medicines surgical appliances 
many necessaries depend solely upon ships succeeded making way enemy cruisers running blockade ports 
wine tea coffee imported articles soon became luxuries beyond means even wealthy 
sorts substitutes used grain roasted ground chiefly used substitute coffee 
hitherto south principally occupied raising cotton tobacco depending chiefly upon north food necessary abandon cultivation products sale devote land growth maize crops food 
time long period inaction came close vincent completely recovered strength ready rejoin ranks soon order came colonel stuart promised send directly prospect active service 
one vincent first questions soon became convalescent whether letter received tony 
come told among last batch letters crossed frontier outbreak hostilities mrs wingfield requested opened 
arranged merely contained tony address village near montreal vincent warned say nothing letter saying troubled times approaching tony left whose hands might fall 
vincent starting told mother share taken getting negro safely away mrs wingfield brought regard assisted runaway slaves escape light assisted steal kind property first greatly shocked heard son taken part enterprise however worthy compassion slave might however brutal master whose hands fled 
however vincent point starting war meet danger possibly death defense virginia said little little reference rather imprudence course taken regarded mind folly indeed criminality 
however promised soon tony letter arrived would still possible forward dinah child supplying money journey giving papers freeing slavery vincent duly signed presence justice 
letter came however already late 
fighting point commencing intercourse across border stopped trains taken conveyance troops even man would great difficulty passing northward unprotected negress baby journey would impossible 
mrs wingfield therefore written four times fortnightly intervals tony saying impossible send dinah present dispatched soon troubles upon receipt another letter saying address unchanged giving new one 
letters duly posted probable one would time reach tony mails sent europe whenever opportunity offered taken steamer running blockade southern port 
dinah therefore still remained orangery 
well happy life delightful one indeed toil hardship jacksons although anxious join husband knowledge well safe pursuit sooner later would join child sufficient make perfectly contented 
vincent illness constant attendant child longer required care passed much time nursery young children slaves looked two three aged negresses past active work 
therefore begged mrs wingfield allowed take place bedside young master giving trial mrs wingfield found quiet gentle patient installed able obtain rest needed feeling confidence vincent would well attended absence 
vincent well enough sisters surprised change taken place since started months war 
much grown though done considerably much older manner appearance 
man work work requiring vigilance activity courage could longer treat boy 
became stronger took riding plantation upon wildfire horse still troop colonel stuart promised see animal well cared one ride upon 
hope like jonas pearson better used vincent mrs wingfield said day two started rejoin troop 
say mother replied shortly 
man civil civil fact like believe honest 
mean would cheat though may anything know pretends violent secessionist comes vermont natural imagine would sing different tune bluecoats ever get richmond 
still nothing particular say except like trust 
long everything goes well confederacy suppose matters ever get worst see fellow mischievous 
illustration map country richmond fort monroe 
however hear obeyed orders flogging estate since went away 
fact far see keep anything like sharp hand slaves used fields work seems done slovenly way 
game know doubt whatever game mind 
prejudiced boy mrs wingfield said laughing 
first man strict furious think lenient suspect call game sort 
hard please indeed 
vincent smiled 
well told shall see 
hope wrong pearson believe 
may prejudiced nothing persuade jackson learned dinah owe visit sheriff searching plantation tony 
however whatever man heart far see injury long things go sincerely trust never opportunity 
winter vincent made acquaintance many southern leaders 
town center movement heart confederacy 
capital southern states efforts northerners principally directed flocked leading men parts country 
although every virginian family members front feeling anxiety reigned everywhere semblance gayety kept 
theater opened parties balls given order keep spirits people example higher rank 
balls differed widely appearance eighteen months 
gentlemen almost uniform already calicoes cheap fabrics worn many ladies foreign dress materials could longer purchased 
mrs wingfield made point always attending entertainments daughters young people afforded cheerful break dullness monotony usual life owing absence almost young men army long cessation pleasant interchange visits impromptu parties social gatherings formed feature life virginia 
balls would dull affairs residents richmond present leave granted much possible officers stationed regiments within railway run town eagerly availed change monotony camp life girls reason complain want partners 
receptions given president davis vincent met leaders confederacy civil military 
many personal friends wingfields secession movement began among general magruder commanded troops round richmond 
early winter general called orangery 
going make call upon patriotism planters neighborhood mrs wingfield said lunch time 
see armies facing federals opposite washington offer firm front foe marching north unfortunately command sea nothing prevent embarking army board ship landing either james york rivers case might make rush upon richmond would time bring troops aid 
therefore proposing erect chain works two rivers able keep even large army bay enforcements arrive large number hands required going ask proprietors plantations place many negroes spare disposal 
doubt response quest meet general 
present scarcely enough work slaves 
intend grow tobacco next year rot warehouse comparatively small number hands required raise corn crops 
hundred seventy working hands orangery shall happy place hundred disposal long time may require 
want fifty course 
everything else must present give way good cause 
thank much mrs wingfield offers put name first list contributors 
seem quite recovered said vincent minutes afterward 
yes ashamed staying long general 
feel pain times nothing front doctor says importance rest long possible stayed 
major ashley promised recall soon prospect active work 
think quite likely active work soon anywhere else general said 
know pretty well washington though nothing decided upon party favor landing force shall hot work 
say like get commission appoint one aids de camp 
knowledge country make useful ashley specially mentioned name one dispatches commission asking 
fighting round interest defending home taking part general engagements safety state 
enable good deal home although far slaves behaved extremely well saying exactly may happen northerners come among us 
rejoin corps afterward know nothing comes 
vincent first inclined decline offer mother sisters pleased near finally accepted thanks principally influenced general last argument possibly might trouble slaves event landing james peninsula northerners

anyhow shall glad know 
young jackson away know one stuart troops horse though never happened run since war began 
firing hardly ceased harrison landing general jackson force men composed division commanded general winder general ewell division portion general hill started rapidan check general pope plundering wasting country advanced marching south object reach gordonsville would cut line railway connecting richmond west virginia 
vincent glad regiment appointed would jackson command would campaigning old division consisted largely virginian troops contained many old friends

mcclellan marched troops across james peninsula harrison landing yorktown greater portion embarked transports taken rappahannock aquia creek landed marched fredericksburg 
lee instead attacking mcclellan march across peninsula determined take army north join jackson attack pope joined mcclellan army 
pope although already largely enforced retired hastily took new position strongly fortified could attacked 
general stuart come lee command cavalry 
shall see work remark round fires th virginia cavalry 
hitherto although several times engaged federals forced remain part inactive owing vast superiority force enemy cavalry stuart come felt certain whatever disparity numbers would soon dashing work done 
except upon actual duty strict lines military discipline much relaxed among cavalry troopers almost sons farmers planters equal social rank officers many personal friends relatives 
several vincent schoolfellows ranks two three fellow officers often gathered together round camp fire chatted old schooldays mutual friends 
many already fallen virginia regiments stonewall jackson brigade terribly thinned loss many friends knowledge turn might come next suffice lessen high spirits brave young men 
hard work rough life exposure hardship braced invigorated attaining far vigorous manhood would ever possessed grown somewhat sluggish enervating life led young planters 
many young men campaign began never done half hour hard work lives 
waited upon slaves exercise riding 
months almost lived saddle slept open air thought lucky could obtain sufficient meal roughest food satisfy hunger day 
respect however cavalry better comrades infantry scouting small parties wide extent country sure meal hearty welcome whenever could spare time stop half hour house farmer 
glorious life wingfield chatted future school never dreamed life though us talk entering army even occasional skirmish indians limit ideas 
yes glorious life vincent agreed 
imagine anything exciting 
course risk shot somehow one never seems think 
always something think time one starts scout daybreak one lies night one senses stretch 
besides fighting defense country merely profession though suppose makes much difference one 
far read soldiers enjoy campaigning seem make difference foe fighting 
like feel little sure shall win long run 
chorus indignant protests possible doubts issue 
thrashed every time met wingfield 
well vincent said 
virginia held held 
beat back scott mcclellan thrashed pope stonewall jackson dozen battles west virginia 
must remember parts gradually closing ports already taken closely blockaded 
pushing along lines great rivers worst fill vacancies hired emigrants fast one army disappears another takes place 
believe shall beat shall prove proved one southerner fighting home liberty match two hired soldiers even good large sprinkling yankees among 
long run sure shall win go putting big armies field day must get used 
course possible may day capture washington north may get weary tremendous drain money men caused attempt conquer us 
hope may like think win long run 
never feel doubt winning battle begin 
fear may get used north tired 
expect hear talk wingfield always seem capital spirits 
capital spirits vincent replied ready fight always confident shall lick yankees fact doubt whether long run shall outlast interfere slightest degree comfort present 
sorry though fellow pope carrying war brutally instead manner general mcclellan commanders waged 
proclamation army must subsist upon country passes gives direct invitation soldiers pillage order farmers refuse take oath union driven homes sent south means ruin peaceful inhabitants scarcely man part virginia heartily us 
hear one officers said prisoner captured morning says pope already sees made mistake yesterday issued fresh order saying proclamation meant authorize pillage 
finds inhabitants whatever private sentiments maintained sort neutrality hostile drive cattle woods even set fire stacks prevent anything carried yanks troops find roads broken bridges destroyed sorts difficulties thrown way 
always pay even war brutal 
glad see found mistake soon another officer said 
mcclellan waged war like gentleman blackguards allowed carry fire sword land soon find game two play matters become horribly embittered 
shall never vincent said 
generals gentlemen lee jackson many others true christians well true soldiers sure never countenance side whatever northerners may 
ready fight hordes yankees hired soldiers often advance us sure none us would fire homestead ill treat defenseless men women 
scandal brutalities committed ruffians call southerners 
guerrillas missouri tennessee equally bad whether side president would send couple regiments hunt fellows bring dishonor cause 
south free without aid ruffians kind better lay arms 
bravo wingfield spoken like knight chivalry one others laughed 
many bands done good nevertheless 
kept enemy busy occupied attention large force might otherwise woods yonder pope 
agree would better whole thing fought large armies good deal said bands severe upon 
composed men made desperate seeing farms harried buildings burned enemy 
denounced traitors neighbors side retaliate know altogether blamed 
know place home burned people insulted ill treated inclined set avenge 
would vincent agreed upon wrong upon innocent people 
well side destroy people farms showing two play game make observe laws war 
grant would much better thing take place northerners begin sort work may sure retaliation 
anyhow glad officer th virginia guerrilla leader missouri 
well talking dry work 
one got full canteen vincent said 
dan managed buy gallon rum farmhouse yesterday

word passed line perfect silence observed move forward column ranks closing much possible lose touch 
heads bent blankets wrapped around cloaks cavalry rode pouring rain

half hour brisk riding knew sharp sound beat horses hoofs left soft track forest upon regular road 
thank goodness vincent said low tone next neighbor 
mind brush enemy like idea moment brains may knocked branch tree 
agree replied fancy every man felt 
doubt 
hitherto sound heard save jingling accouterments dull heavy sound horses tread could heard mingled buzz voices occasionally low laugh 
accustomed wet soaking scarcely inconvenienced 
forest felt sure guide enemy longed discover 
another hour rapid advance continued felt sure must penetrated enemy lines well rear 
last heard challenge sentry 
stuart voice shouted charge full gallop rode village catlet station orange alexandria railroad general pope headquarters 
another minute midst enemy camp wildest confusion reigned 
federal officers rushed tents made darkness soldiers lying line railroad leaped feet opened heavy fire invisible foes 
cavalry broken camp tents animals piles baggage could little impossible form broken unknown ground 
quarters pope soon discovered escaped leaving coat hat behind 
many officers captured quarters found box official papers invaluable among copies letters asking enforcements lists giving strength position troops particulars greatest value confederates 
time lost firing would set whole federal army alert might find retreat cut 
therefore placing prisoners center taking box papers cavalry called camp without delay started return ride 
take road come made long detour daylight breaking entered confederate lines without encountered foe time leaving catlet station 
short stay camp men returned empty handed 
northern army supplied abundance excellent food descriptions forming strongest possible contrast insufficient rations upon confederate troops existed troopers helped whatever could lay hands upon darkness confusion

thus formation arrived open v angle v pope force way 
longstreet could arrive however enemy hurled upon jackson hours confederates held vast federal army longstreet force far away lend hand 
ammunition failed soldiers fought piles stones night fell without impression made upon veterans 
general lee came general hood division hurled federals drove back 
evening longstreet force took position general lee assigned morning confederate army arrived battle recommenced 
struggle long terrible nightfall every attack repulsed confederates advancing sides drove northerners broken confused crowd darkness alone saving utter destruction 
one hour daylight defeat would complete battle bull run fought precisely ground 
however cover darkness federals retreated centreville whence driven following day 
tremendous fighting jackson command three long days engaged cavalry bore comparatively small part 
federal artillery powerful permit employment large bodies cavalry although time time charges made opportunity seemed offer battle fought infantry artillery 
end came jackson command time hors de combat 
long two days march least gathered corn apples sustain life three days fighting food whatever many weak could longer march

jackson marched away laid siege harper ferry important depot garrisoned men forced surrender mcclellan fresh army strong pressing forward succor arrived within day march 
soon jackson taken place hurried away troops join lee facing enemy antietam river 
upon following day another terrible battle fought confederates though strong repulsing every attack federals driving terrible slaughter back across river 
loss however heavy lee knowing could expect assistance enemy constantly receiving enforcements waited day collect wounded bury dead send stores artillery rear retired unpursued across rappahannock 
thus hard fought campaign came end 
vincent wingfield army retired across rappahannock 
portion cavalry followed broken federals edge stream reined horses round shot one federal batteries carried away cap fell dead horse 
night northerners crossed stream collect bring back wounded fallen near coming across vincent finding still breathed apparently without wound carried back across river prisoner 
vincent indeed escaped without wound stunned passage shot carried away cap missed fraction inch 
begun recover consciousness captors came action carrying completely restored 
fallen hands northerners well aware unable imagine happened 
remembered confederates moment fell completely successful could imagine subsequent attack federals turned tables upon 
fallen happened idea 
beyond strange feeling numbness head conscious injury could imagine horse shot must fallen upon head 
thought favorite horse killed afflicted almost much capture 
soon captors perceived prisoner consciousness returned reported officer stuart cavalry taken daybreak next morning general mcclellan rising acquainted fact vincent conducted tent 
unwounded sir general said surprise 
general vincent replied 
know happened believe horse must shot must thrown stunned however remember nothing moment heard word halt reached side stream found carried 
belong cavalry yes sir 
lee force engaged yesterday know vincent said 
came jackson division harper ferry evening 
need questioned mcclellan said 
know lee whole army strong opposed yesterday 
vincent silent 
glad see federal general usual enormously overrated strength force opposed 
hear whole garrison harper ferry released parole serve war 
ready give promise effect allow return friends must remain prisoner regularly exchanged 
must general vincent said quietly 
could remain home remain inactive every man south fighting defense country take chance exchanged 
sorry choose alternative mcclellan said 
hate see brave men imprisoned day braver men across yonder stream found 
officers men astonished 
seem thin worn scarce able lift musket clothes fit scarecrow indeed pitiful objects look way fight wonderful 
could believed seen men could charged across ground swept tremendous artillery musketry fire wonderful tell young man even though beat us proud countrymen believe general jackson ride camp would cheered lustily heartily men 
fifty sixty prisoners taken captured hand hand struggle taken place parts field got separated corps mixed enemy carried field retired 
part accepted offered parole fifteen like vincent preferred northern prison promising abstain fighting defense country middle day placed together tent guard rear camp 
next morning came news lee fallen back 
exultation among federals unmingled strong sense relief heavy losses inflicted previous fighting taken ardor attack mcclellan army glad indeed called upon make another attempt drive confederates position 
vincent less pleased news 
knew thin ranks confederate fighting men greatly worn exhausted fatigue want food although day repulsed attacks masses well fed northerners tremendous exertions could often repeated defeat river rear approachable one rough narrow road would meant total destruction army 
next morning vincent companions put train sent alexandria 
reason complain treatment upon way 
well fed starvation diet last six weeks rations seemed actually luxurious 
federal troops alexandria part young recruits arrived north west looked astonishment upon thin ragged men several barefooted 
possible scarecrows could every battle driven back well fed cared northern soldiers like one burly young soldier western state asked guard 
sir sergeant charge party replied 
much look gosh see fight think looks 
soldiering young farmer said solemnly sooner back home better 
seem altogether strange fight hard say must look upon comfort killed rather live like 
shout laughter prisoners showed young rustic objects pity consider life altogether intolerable even circumstances moved away meditating discomforts war upon remarks would made return home sorrowful plight confederate prisoners 
bargained fight said though expect shall like draw back time comes starved till nigh skeleton going barefooted rags tramp look aint reasonable 
yet known among fifteen prisoners half possessors wide estates brought childhood midst luxuries young farmer never dreamed 
among many soldiers sympathy took active form men pressed forward gave packets tobacco cigars little presents two three pressed rolls dollar notes hands words rough kindness 
aint ill feeling us rebs 
done work like men doubt thinks cause right maybe turn come next see inside one prisons south 
soldiers together feel 
discipline small matters never strictly enforced american armies sergeant charge offered opposition soldiers mingling prisoners walked along 
two days later sent railway great prison elmira state new york 
reached jail prisoners separated vincent officer assigned quarters twenty others rank 
prisoners crowded round entered eager hear last news front heard guards news constant victories northerners every defeat transformed northern papers brilliant victory shattered remains various armies returned alexandria formed truth gradually leaked 
thus antietam claimed great northern victory although mcclellan troops battle hurled back shattered broken across river two days afterward lee retired 
one prisoners also dressed cavalry uniform hung back rest going window looked vincent chatting others 
presently turned round vincent recognized surprise old opponent jackson

first start seeing dan vincent scarcely surprised often thought boy would fancied supposed dead would go straight back orangery quite possible hear prisoner dan might take head endeavor join 
making escape appear difficult undertaking friend outside 
watch kept vigilant one numbers prisoners taken sides regarded great importance indeed difficulty lay rather making across country southern border escaping prison friend outside disguise readiness matter comparatively easy 
required adventure long rope sharp file dark night 
chief difficulty occurred vincent arose fact twenty prisoners ward 
could hardly file bars window unnoticed would naturally wish share flight one person might succeed evading vigilance guard unlikely extreme twenty would alarm given would recaptured 
spared trouble making mind plans time finished letter hour hucksters allowed sell goods passed gates shut quiet 
thought came conclusion plan would conceal somewhere prison hour locked wards 
alarm would given list names called lock search would course made 
still could find good place concealment might succeed since search dark would close minute would made next morning 
disadvantage would sentries would specially alert unless fugitive succeeded way passing gates disguise must still within walls might attempt scale night 
certainty largely increased danger vincent went bed night without finally determining better done 
next morning walking grounds determined place would choose concealment adopted plan thought evening 
lower rooms upon one side building inhabited governor officers prison spring open window unnoticed became dusk hide cupboard bed would safe time however close search might parts building would scarcely suspected rate first alarm concealed officers quarters

took melon room would sure find men would naturally called upon divide fruit yet nowhere else could hide 
long time sat back wall melon beside abusing folly told dan send rope small lengths could hide

risky business would gladly tossed melon wall dared detected would punished much severe imprisonment dan might arrested punished severely 
unfortunately weather means hot would look strange take coat besides could coil rope round without observed idea abandoned

walked two three miles across country 
fields part deserted although saw cultivated patches evident inhabitants quitted part country scene almost continued fighting commencement war sufferings inhabitants greatly heightened bands marauders moved plundering destroying pretense punishing considered hostile cause whose favor nominally least enrolled

would good thing said dan generals sides district would agree month truce join hunting hanging marauding scoundrels 
side mosby leaders bands composed almost entirely gentlemen never accused practices kind exceptions little choose 
walking four five miles sat till evening going river endeavored find boat could cross disappointment craft kind visible although many places stages riverside evidently used farmers unloading produce boats 
vincent concluded last period struggle boats must collected either sunk carried away one parties prevent crossing river 
hitherto carefully avoided farmhouses appeared inhabited vincent determined approach one endeavor gain information distance next bridge whether guarded troops find possible position northern forces tennessee present posted points present ignorant 
passed two three large farmhouses without entering although greater part male population away one armies might still find two three hands buildings 
besides late whatever politics inmates would suspicious late arrivals would probably altogether refuse admittance

leave front captain wingfield shall ready start night sir 
case trouble come evening 
fast train going ammunition lee ten clock shall bag dispatches trouble deliver 
find last moment 
give orders horse box attached train 
expressing thanks vincent took leave 
left general quarters young man alighting horse gave shout greeting 
wingfield good see thought pining yankee dungeon got knocked head crossing lines 
sprung arrive got yesterday sundry adventures tell presently 
arrive front came days ago week leave urgent family business young man laughed going back afternoon four clock train 
stay till ten vincent said go back together 
special train going ammunition everything make way long behind four clock likely enough may pass way 
horse box attached take one horse room 
brought horse harry furniss said certainly go ten clock 
long talk 
think seen since day asked lend boat two years ago 
spare two hours vincent asked 
great favor 
harry furniss looked watch 
eleven clock lot people lunch half past one must back 
manage easy enough vincent replied two hours time leave home 
man vincent 
wait five minutes see someone 
minutes later harry furniss came mounted 
way vincent want way jackson place cedars tell ride 
vincent recounted feud jacksons date purchase dinah moore friend aware present sale 
heard attack upon young jackson tony disappearance dinah moore 
surprised wingfield surmises correct old scoundrel carried girl avenge upon tony 
course could prove would serious offense stealing slave force crime heavy penalty cost men lives 
see anything like positive proof however strong case suspicion may 
see going say get 
going tell say done girl son arrested treachery soon sets foot confederacy 
treachery furniss said surprise 
treachery guilty saw one escaped rather wondered time two mixed together anything 
heard recaptured black fellow slave read account 
got proof say perhaps proof would hold court law vincent replied proof enough make absolute certainty mind 
vincent gave account escape anonymous denunciation dan 
said one dan knew intended escape one knew clothes purchased one could possibly known disguised preacher dan servant 
therefore information must given jackson 
least doubt blackguard give wingfield proof 
consider proof absolute positive proof vincent asserted one else could known 
well see matter fact officer know might possibly given information 
idea absurd 
never quarrel owed liberty 
wingfield 
certain jackson know circumstances see absolute proof one man 
true quarrel jackson two years see made become friends prison much selected among score others room companion flight 
know jackson well believe guilty act gross ingratitude ingratitude treachery people know would hardly credit possible man could villain 
defense would set would first place shadow evidence turned traitor 
second place would sure say accusation confederate officer monstrous preposterous entertained moment doubtless negro although denies fact really chattered doings negroes lodging someone got know disguise would wear 
know wingfield ninety nine every hundred white men south would rather believe negro chattered confederate officer guilty gross act treachery ingratitude 
vincent silent 
felt companion said truth weapon hoped force elder jackson saying done dinah would probably fail purpose 
old man astute perceive real proof son would therefore unlikely admit committed serious crime forego revenge 
try rate said last refuses publish story papers 
fellow gets back yankee land may either call demand court inquiry 
may succeed getting verdict twelve white men think convince everyone class fellow battle expected got three months leave move heaven earth find woman jackson either bolt stand trial prospect ten years imprisonment convicted 
either case likely son venture back brought action chance getting damages would small one 
another half hour ride brought cedars 
dismounted house fastening horses portico knocked door 
opened negro 
tell master vincent said mr wingfield wishes speak 
andrew jackson came door 
owe great pleasure visit mr wingfield said grimly 
come ask done dinah moore every ground believing caused kidnaped mother house 
serious charge young gentleman andrew jackson said one shall call upon justify law courts 
men charged criminal actions even young gentlemen good virginian families 
shall quite ready meet mr jackson whenever choose visit rather give opportunity escaping consequences follow detection author crime warn bring crime home whatever costs time money 
offer produce woman child shall prosecution take place remain silent concerning fact affects honor son 
andrew jackson face perfectly unmoved conversation heard allusion son 
face changed visibly 
know nothing concerning attack honor son mr wingfield said effort speak unconcernedly 
charge follows vincent said quietly imprisoned elmira number officers among son 
thinking time unpleasantness existing us come end offered hand 
accepted became friends 
short time afterward mode escape offered proved sincerity feelings toward offering another officer means sharing escape 
accepted 
outside walls furnished disguises prepared assuming minister 
separated going different directions accompanied negro servant whose fidelity owed escape 
two days afterward anonymous writer communicated police fact escaped disguise minister accompanied black servant 
fact known negro two officers 
negro released certainly betrayer officer could certainly possible motive betraying 
remains therefore son whose hostility notorious expressed bitterness many occasions among others hearing friend mr furniss 
case intention charge military authorities act treachery 
said willing forego keep silence conduct reference slave dinah moore restore child uninjured house caused taken 
sallow cheeks old planter grown shade paler listened vincent narrative burst angry tones dare sir bring infamous accusation son accusation like wholly unsupported shred evidence doubtless negro confided associates plans assisting escape prison one denunciation come 
go sir report lies fables invented assured son seek compensation gross libels courts 
well sir vincent said prepared mount horse take trouble look papers morrow see threats action libel effect whatever upon 
man hard rock wingfield furniss said rode together 
wilted little telling story moment saw definite proofs expected would ready defy 
shall shall ride back richmond give full account escape jail state firmly believe information disguise given jackson result personal hostility many young men richmond well aware existed time us 
well must like wingfield think risky business 
may vincent said little doubt long jackson exchanged shall discovered dinah shall prosecute jackson theft kidnaping case young man hardly venture prosecute indeed show face part country 
evening two young officers started front next morning richmond papers came sensational heading alleged gross act treachery ingratitude confederate officer 
th december vincent joined army fredericksburg 
reported general stuart received great cordiality 
time wingfield said 
believe another twenty four hours battle fought 
last two days moving front apparently want us believe intend cross somewhere town news get spies effect feints intend throw bridge across 
know anyhow got two trains concealed opposite near river 
burnside likely find hard nut crack 
course superior number us always always beat well level ground think chances getting heights means hopeful 
change commanders 
mcclellan fought drawn battle us antietam showed really able general operations front richmond 
army confidence far best man got far fools washington second time displaced jealous 
burnside shown good man minor commands think equal command vast army besides know friends washington protested advance across river overruled 
see fredericksburg add another long list victories 
vincent shared tent another officer rank general stuart staff 
sat chatting till late still dark suddenly aroused outbreak musketry river 
general right captain longmore vincent companion exclaimed 
evidently throwing bridge across river fire hear comes two regiments mississippians posted town barksdale 
work minute throw clothes hurry

minutes later officer rode 
wood thrown fire light vincent recognized stonewall jackson 
news us asked 
yet sent officer inquire 
enemy trying bridge river 
suppose jackson replied 
ordered one brigades come head bank soon formed help barksdale need want take town 
commanded hills opposite side know brought also artillery 
minutes captain longmore returned 
enemy thrown two pontoon bridges across one one old railway bridge 
mississippians driven back pushing work soon get finished general barksdale bids report force command repulse attempt cross 
light breaking east roar musketry continued canopy fog 
generals lee longstreet others arrived upon spot vincent surprised orders issued troops enforce general barksdale 
presently sun rose gained power fog slowly lifted seen two pontoon bridges complete fire mississippians heavy although enemy several times attempted cross recoiled 
suddenly gun fired opposite height signal hundred pieces artillery opened fire upon town 
many inhabitants left soon musketry fire began slopes behind soon presented sad spectacle 
men women children poured town bewildered din terrified storm shot shell crashed 
higher higher crowd fugitives made way reached crest among weeping women crying children many scantiest attire carrying articles dress valuables caught startled terrible rain missiles 
minutes smoke began rise town followed tongues flame half hour place fire score places 
day bombardment went without cessation fredericksburg crumbled ruins 
still spite terrible fire mississippians clung burning town amid crashing walls falling chimneys shells exploding every direction 
night fell enemy poured across bridges barksdale contesting every foot ground fell back burning city took position behind stone wall rear 
throughout day single shot fired confederate artillery inferior power enemy general lee wish finally hinder passage federals stubborn resistance barksdale force intended give time concentrate army soon knew certain point enemy going cross wish therefore risk destruction batteries calling federal fire upon 
day troops brought position 
longstreet left jackson right guns forty seven number readiness take post morning slopes front 
extreme right general stuart posted cavalry horse artillery 
night passed quietly daybreak troops drawn positions 
soon sun rose seen night enemy thrown bridges across greater portion army already 
indeed already movement confederate position attack directed toward portion line held jackson division 
general stuart gave orders major pelham commanded horse artillery immediately brought guns began battle opening fire flank enemy 
guns northern batteries replied hours artillery duel continued federal guns heavy execution 
time attacks threatened various points ten clock fog lifted mass troops advanced jackson 
suffered come within eight hundred yards gun fired fourteen guns opened upon effect fell back confusion 
one clock another attempt made covered tremendous fire artillery 
time columns attack kept bay fire confederate batteries advanced great resolution pushed way jackson first line forced fall back 
jackson brought second line drove enemy back great slaughter advance checked fire northern artillery 
day fight went federals attempting crush confederate artillery weight fire order infantry columns might advance 
although outnumbered two one confederate guns worked great resolution day passed darkness began fall without retiring positions taken 
sunset general stuart ordered batteries right advance 
opened fire northern infantry effect fell back position near town occupied morning 
left equally terrible battle raged day northern troops compelled cross open ground town base hill suffered terribly fire never succeeded reaching confederate front 
throughout day confederates held position ease general lee considered affair nothing demonstration force feel position expected even sterner battle following day 
jackson first second lines composed less men repulsed without difficulty divisions franklin hooker strong longstreet force never really pressed enemy although side force men 
morning northern army seen drawn battle array advance fresh assault movement made 
general burnside favor fresh attack generals commanding various divisions felt troops repulse day equal work unanimously opinion second assault attempted 
remaining hours order battle fell back town two days later whole army recrossed rappahannock river 
loss confederates men part killed wounded enemy artillery federal loss less 
general burnside soon afterward resigned command general hooker officer politics president advisers appointed succeed 
cavalry called upon act day vincent duties confined carrying orders commanders various batteries artillery posted part field placed general stuart orders 
many narrow escapes shot fragments shells passed day uninjured 
general lee blamed taking advantage victory falling upon federals morning battle although assault might possibly successful conscious immense inferiority force troops would compelled advanced attack across ground completely swept fire magnificently served northern artillery posted upon commanding heights 
moreover ignorant full extent loss inflicted upon enemy expected renewed attack 
therefore doubtless unwilling risk results victory gained victory expected gain enemy renew attack movement might successful would rate cost tremendous loss men men already becoming scarce confederacy 
soon enemy fallen back across river certain little chance another forward movement part considerable time vincent showed general stuart permit received return home spring leave received general permission retire staff time

anxious news came great battle fought last friday heard next morning enemy repulsed easily anxious although morning list killed wounded published minds set rest 
mother tremendous artillery battle little least side 
never heard anything like sunrise sunset 
artillery fire frightening dangerous except comparatively close quarters 
enemy must fired least fifty shots every man hit 
counted several times fully hundred shots minute think lessened much whole day 
think must fired two three hundred rounds least gun 
roar incessant din made replies artillery bursting shells rattle musketry din times almost bewildering 
wildfire hit piece shell fortunately large one much worse shock knocked legs course went thought moment hit 
far hollow affair 
enemy fought obstinately enough without slightest spirit dash get anywhere near line went back good deal quicker came 
going us three months vincent hope mother least advance

afraid drawing rather heavily mother vincent put
