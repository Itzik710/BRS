separately looked direction one another without word returned unread parlor shutting door drawing green silk curtain close better read privacy 
coulson philip felt something unusual going perhaps full consideration possible contents london letter attention immediate business 
fortunately little shop 
philip indeed quite idle john foster opened parlor door half doubtfully called room 
door communication shut three coulson felt little aggrieved 
minute ago philip level ignorance former evidently going raised

certain circumstances mentioned regarding transactions fosters manufacturer could known confidence one fosters man said perfect stranger 
probably would unwilling incur risk done manufacturer dickinson account belonged denomination publicly distinguished excellent philanthropic character letters provocative anxiety especially since morning post brought writer full name various particulars showing intimate knowledge dickinson affairs 
much perplexed consultation john hit upon plan sending hepburn london make secret inquiries respecting true character commercial position man whose creditors month ago esteemed honor

pretty late afternoon indeed almost evening arrived small inn quay side intended sleep 
rough kind place frequented principally sailors recommended daniel robson known well former days 
accommodation however clean homely people keeping respectable enough way 
still hepburn rather repelled appearance sailors sate drinking bar asked low voice another room 
woman stared surprise shook head 
hepburn went separate table away roaring fire cold march evening great attraction called food drink 
seeing men eyeing sociable idea speaking asked pen ink paper intention defeating purpose pre occupation part 
paper came new pen unused thickened ink hesitated long began write last slowly put words dear honoured uncle pause meal brought hastily swallowed 
even eating kept occasionally touching letters words 
drunk glass ale began write fluently time giving account plough 
came another long stop weighing mind say kinraid 
thought second writing sylvia telling much might treasure lover words like grains gold lighter dust meaning philip mind words specksioneer used counters beguile lead astray silly women 
prove constancy action chances giving proof infinitesimal philip estimation 
latter mention bare fact kinraid impressment robson would natural course things remembering last time philip seen either company 
twenty times put pen paper intention relating briefly event befallen kinraid often stopped though first word would irrevocable 
thus sate pen hand thinking wiser conscience looking beyond next step bade take indefinite future caught fragments sailors talk end room made listen words 
speaking kinraid thought filled mind like actual presence 
rough careless way spoke specksioneer admiration enough powers sailor harpooner passed jesting mention power amongst women one two girls names spoken connection 
hepburn silently added annie coulson sylvia robson list cheeks turned paler 
long done speaking kinraid paid shot gone away sate attitude thinking bitter thoughts 
people house prepared bed 
silent guest took heed mute signs 
length landlord spoke started gathered wits together effort prepared retire rest 
signed directed letter uncle leaving still open however case sudden feeling prompt add postscript 
landlord volunteered information letter guest writing must posted early next morning going south mails direction left newcastle every day 
night long hepburn wearied passionate tossings prompted stinging recollection 
towards morning fell dead sound sleep 
roused hasty knocking door 
broad full daylight overslept smack leaving early tide 
even summoned board 
dressed wafered letter rushed neighbouring post office without caring touch breakfast paid embarked 
board experienced relief always undecided man generally first one paltering duty circumstances decide 
first case pleasant relieved burden decision second responsibility seems shifted impersonal events 
philip sailed mouth tyne great open sea 
would week smack reached london even pursued tolerably straight course keep sharp look possible impressment crew many dodges adventures end fortnight time leaving monkshaven philip found safely housed london ready begin delicate piece work given 
felt fully capable unravelling clue information deciding value knowledge gained 
leisure voyage wisely determined communicate everything learned dickinson short every step took matter letter employers 
thus mind lodgings might appeared fully occupied concerns others 
times miserable luxury dwelling upon affairs lay bed till fell restless sleep point steps tended walks ascertained 
gave memory regret often deepened despair seldom cheered hope

letter despatched hepburn began wonder hoped writing 
knew daniel could write rather could make strange hieroglyphics meaning puzzled others often pen ink signs seldom employed robson never far philip knew purpose letter writing 
still craved news sylvia even sight paper seen perhaps touched thought trouble plough say nothing one twopence postage prepaid order make sure letter reception frugal household haytersbank well lost mere chance uncle caring enough intelligence write reply even get friend write answer case perhaps philip might see name mentioned way even though sent duty 
post office dumb letter came daniel robson 
philip heard true employers pretty frequently business felt sure would named ill befallen uncle family knew relationship intimacy 
generally ended formal letters formal summary monkshaven news never mention robsons well soothe philip impatient curiosity 
never confided attachment cousin one way sometimes thought coulson taken present appointment confidential piece employment ill would written asked go haytersbank farm let know 
time transacting affair sent great skill indeed several ways quietly laying foundation enlarging business monkshaven 
naturally grave quiet slow speak impressed saw idea greater age experience really possessed 
indeed encountered london thought absorbed business money making 
yet time came could wind affairs return monkshaven would given possessed letter uncle telling something sylvia 
still hoped hear robson although knew hoped reason 
often convince good argument wish need never expected end reasoning find might saved trouble wishes untouched strong enemies peace mind ever 
hepburn baulked hope mordecai sitting haman gate success errand london well worldly affairs tasteless gave pleasure blank void intelligence concerning sylvia 
yet came back letter fosters pocket curt yet expressive deep gratitude discreet services london another time fact philip life ordered differently might given man unworthy pleasure remember without penny simply diligence honesty faithful quick sightedness interests masters risen hold promise successor ranked trusted friend
