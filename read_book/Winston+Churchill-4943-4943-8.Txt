centralisation power assured concentration military material

berber metemma known abu hamed believed fulfil condition 
berber metemma important strategic points 
improbable dervishes would abandon keys khartoum soudan without severe resistance 
seemed likely indeed khalifa would strongly reinforce towns desperately contest possession 
deserts korti metemma suakin berber contained scattered wells small raiding parties might cut railway perhaps starved army head 
therefore dangerous project railway towards either berber metemma actually hands 
argument circular 
towns could taken without strong force strong force could advance railway made railway could made till towns taken 
korti metemma suakin berber routes therefore rejected 
resolution exclude latter strengthened fact labor building railway hills behind suakin would great 
route via abu hamed selected exclusion alternatives 
distinct apparent advantages

great omdurman army taken field possibility would become certainty 
young kordofan general saw opportunity begged allowed seize 
khalifa sent army back city badly informed numbers disposition egyptian force allowed metemma dervishes move 
mahmud received permission advance end january
