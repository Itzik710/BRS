bladud received orders silence obeyed unquestioning unhesitating promptitude one surest evidences fitness command 
meanwhile mate accustomed captain habits needed instructions caused sailors lay shields swords sight feet might approach pirates character simple traders completely cowed appearance foe 
increase aspect fear sail lowered drew near oars used complete distance yet intervened two vessels 
humble submissive approach however throw pirates quite guard 
stood arms prepared spring board victim close enough 
pirate vessel lay motionless water presented broadside trader 
captain took care steer relative position maintained 
pirate chief huge man rude armor breast plate thick bull hide shield left arm gave orders pull oars one side vessel two might brought alongside 
fifty yards apart moment 
order could carried effect however arkal uttered low hiss 
instantly double banks oars bent almost breaking point penelope leaped forward like sentient creature 
man seized sword shield sprang bladud forgetting helmet shield hurry moment poised mighty javelin astonished owner enemies days gone another moment hurled shrieking air

whole incident sudden pirates scarcely time recover surprise bow penelope crashed side vessel stove trader like war vessels period provided ram purpose 
penelope recoiled shock yell rage burst pirates volley javelins stones followed owing confusion resulting shock ill directed found mark caught shields 
another discharge could made pirate vessel heeled sank leaving crew miscreants struggling sea

chapter three 
voyage 
weather always suppose always capricious 
uncertainty character levant atlantic days old always smiling day frowning morrow playful lamb one day raging like lion next 
rough handling experienced penelope beginning voyage rude boreas kindly retired spicy breezes africa rippled sea sufficient force intensify heavenly blue fill great square sail occasion ply oars 
one dark starlight moonless night time quiet talk prevailed stem stern vessel grizzled mariners spun long yarns prowess experiences deep benefit awe stricken youthful shipmates whose careers commencing 
heard doubt great sea serpent observed little maikar speedily recovered flattening bladud subjected busy enlivening knot young fellows bow ship 
course cried one father used tell small boy 
never saw though tin isles albion said met men spoken shipmates heard men seen days described exactly 
ah remarked another met man seen first voyage quite youth said bull head horns dreadful long body scales something like ass tail end 
pooh nonsense exclaimed little maikar twirling thumbs smoking introduced world period thumb twirling would seem served ancient world leisurely pastime quite well better least led infer fact herodotus makes mention anything like vague mysterious sensation unsatisfied desire fill mouth smoke early ages would certainly done taste smoke natural craving thumb twirling unsatisfactory occupation 
absolute silence father history think almost proves point 
nonsense repeated little maikar 
youth man told serpent accounts wild description youth prone strange imaginings seems interrupted grave man twirled thumbs slow deliberate way contemplative man smokes seems truth great sea serpent golden fleece 
believe either 
well say returned little man gazing fixedly grave comrade face saw great sea serpent eyes exclaimed group drawing heads closer together looks expectancy 
ay mates expect wild descriptions monsters bulls horns asses tails 
like truth truth brute far away time saw man us could tell exactly like tried description different gave agreed point certainly serpent 
listeners seemed rather disappointed meager account sudden conclusion bidden fair become stirring tale sea maikar aroused expectations stating firm belief nonsense one sea serpent 
could one demanded ceasing twirl order might clench fist smite knee emphasis 
got grandfather asked turning suddenly grave man 
certainly got two come answered taken rather aback brusque apparently irrelevant nature question 
two repeated little man think likely sea serpent must two grandfathers also undoubtedly two grandmothers well 
perhaps got yet replied grave man contemplative look side rippling sea gleamed phosphoric brilliancy 
exactly continued maikar eager tone course also must two grandfathers besides mother likely great sea serpent father large family 
implies wife suggested one seamen 
necessarily objected elderly seaman lands lying far north albion acquired something tendency object everything times said characterise people far north 
necessarily repeated serpent may bachelor family 
short laugh illogical man group made irrelevant observation led conversation totally different channel relegated great sea serpent time oblivion men thus engaged philosophising bow bladud captain chatting subdued voices stern 
impossible said latter reply remark made former impossible visit father court year though would please much cargo intended south western cassiterides 
get round river banks home stands would oblige run far towards cold regions waters yet visited though know pretty well hearsay 
another voyage may accomplish one 
sorry arkal things put another time often put altogether 
men tin isles often visit father town boats copper tin tracks forest horses traverse 
could visit us overland would journey many weeks trusty mate might look ship absence 
besides diggers may enough metal ready fill ship may idle long time 
say captain arkal frowned wont considering knotty question shook head 
doubt wise venture much said moreover yet end voyage 
little use troubling one self end anything beginning 
nevertheless rejoined bladud consider possible end yet beginning seems unreasonable though undoubtedly may never reach end 
many fair ship sets sail never returns 
ay true know cost returned captain first venture 
long time ago loaded ship size one sent command one best friends euxine sea gold 
think old story jason ship argo sailing search golden fleece running strong youthful brain 
besides course heard report much gold direction hopes strong know world runs gold 
anyhow ship sailed never saw friend 
since contented copper tin 
slight increase wind moment caused captain dismiss golden memories look inquiringly windward 
squall methinks said bladud 
puff replied friend ordering steersman alter course little 
squall puff strong enough cause penelope make graceful bow controlling element cleave sparkling water prow swiftly left gleaming wake lambent fire astern 
short lived however followed calm obliged little maikar comrades cease story telling ply fifty oars 
thus pace kept going though quite swiftly running stiff breeze 
gods propitious said captain going prosperous voyage 
many gods propitious asked bladud 
question much deep answer 
deep think use would thinking returned captain lightly 
leave matters learned 
mate added turning subordinate going rest 
see keep open eye squalls pirates 
apt come least expect 
neither squalls pirates destined interfere penelope greater part voyage 
day day skies clear sea comparatively smooth winds favourable 
sometimes put ashore weather became stormy circumstances favourable 
occasions lighted camp fires trees ruddy light glowed grand effect picturesque sailors sat stood reclined around 
times obliged keep open sea occasionally met traders like returning home course glad fraternise time exchange views 
meet anything like piratical vessel happened late evening managed plying oars vigorously shade night escape second encounter robbers sea 
thus course time length great inland sea traversed southern coast known france reached captain prophecy regard prosperous voyage thus far fulfilled 
chapter four 
storm wreck

every moment gale increased obliging mariners show corner sail 
even last taken whole dismal day black night followed penelope drove helplessly wind bare pole 
fortunately gale favourable enabled lay course required skill seamanship captain arkal prevent pooped swamped waves rolled hissing hungering mightily swallow 
right man right place times imminent danger important safety craft peace mind whose lives jeopardy 
board little vessel hurricane felt much comforted knowledge captain right place 
although square man means fitted round hole knowing prince bladud felt anxiety management craft gave contemplate grandeur storm howling blast creaking spars bursts rattling thunder rendered conversation question 
slight lull however bladud asked question whether captain knew part coast running 
exactly replied running long darkness guess 
holds much longer like shall put head wind wait light 
may driven far left islands hereabouts must keep well clear 
would put bay shelter befell us 
ho mate 
ay captain 
see put sharpest pair eyes bow let second pair watch first lest owner go sleep 
little maikar sir shouted mate watching

daybreak second day gale moderated little enabled show corner sail encourage hope worst 
fresh outburst greater fury soon dashed hopes obliged captain throw overboard spare spars heaviest part cargo 
still gale increased impatient waves began lip poop occasionally unable refrain tasting cargo must go muttered captain gloomy frown 
resolute gave orders effect 
presently order given take soundings 
done found twenty fathoms water 
taking another cast depth reported fifteen fathoms 
charts covered soundings guide mariner days require much experience convince seaman land probably near sudden change twenty fifteen fathoms 
arkal however unprepared quickly gave orders stand let go anchors 
moment voice little maikar heard shouting stentorian tones land ahead captain replied sharp let go four anchors promptly dropped stern 
moment placed helm fair amidships made fast rudder bands 
stern penelope formed like bow sharp cut water means instantly presented sea thus avoiding necessity danger incurred modern ships similar circumstances anchoring head swinging round 
hungry waves hissed tumultuously cleft passed ship disappointed still enough water beneath permit tossing fro rising like duck strained tugged anchors 
operations performed mists darkness seemed lift little revealed wild rocky line coast waves breaking madly 
hope pray gods men said mate whose courage quite equal position 
gods growled captain bitterly saw ruined man even though escape life 
one god said bladud quietly things well 
spoke captain whose eyes ceased look searchingly along coast observed something like bay short way left place lay 
looks like sandy bay said 
sandy bay exclaimed anxious mate let us anchors run 
easy mind keep advice till asked returned captain look scorn 
destined escape shall escape without making haste 
doomed die nothing save us manly die leisurely way hurry 
see clearly shall know better act 
although manner submitting inevitable quite suit mate felt constrained repress impatience coolness captain quieting effect men inclined give way panic 
sight bladud sat leaning hilt sword expression appeared serene contentment also quieting effect men 
increasing light showed sandy bay spot might possibly reached safety orders given cut cables loose rudder bands hoist sail 
minutes vessel ran swiftly towards bay reaching shore struck violence 
fore part penelope stuck fast immovably last ravenous waves attained longed meal 
burst stern swept decks tore fastenings revelled among tackling began tumultuously break ship 
launch skiff shouted captain hastening lend hand operation 
men slow obey touched water swarmed overloaded upset left occupants struggling water 
number men could swim immediately jumped overboard tried right skiff failed effort broke rope held

long way often scene enacted heard bubbling cry men whose powers failing 
carried currents point westward apparently dashed rocks 
others sank half distance traversed 
bladud captain looked maikar left

swimming thus back captain arkal leading keep right direction three ultimately cast rather exhausted condition shore little bay 
chapter five 
wreck 
southern shore known france hero comrades misfortune cast 
time write need hardly say land nameless 
even old roman name gaul yet given rome founded 
fair land vast wilderness known slightly adventurous mariners east spirit columbus pushed discoveries trade far beyond pillars hercules 
course land vast solitude inhabited sparsely wandering tribes driven westward conquest desire adventure characterised human race suppose ever since adam eve began explore regions beyond eden 
like great wilderness lying north canada present time also home innumerable wild animals afforded uncivilised inhabitants food clothing 
captain arkal one three survivors wreck seen coast knew anything bladud entered mediterranean many years passed far southward see northern land 
staggered beach place thundering waves sent spray bladud looked round anxiety 
surely said crew must escaped 
hardly three survivors many 
party halted looked back seething waves escaped 
would foul shame us said captain try lend helping hand comrades shall find none 
observed started spite warning made straight land instead keeping well windward avoid swept round point rock west 
led right direction alone 
others saved must side point 
speaking captain hurried woods intending cross neck land separated bay beyond point referred 
strength returned ran intense desire render aid late comrades might stand need seemed serve stead rest 
come quick cried little maikar whose catlike activity strength enabled outrun bulky companions 
may late swim know 
reached crest ridge minutes later halting looked dismay bay beyond point full great rocks boulders among waves rushed fury spouted jets air covered sea foam 
living soul landed said captain tone showed clearly given hope 
may swept round next point suggested maikar eagerly commencing run forward spoke 
bladud followed captain evident regarded effort useless 
proved longer toilsome march expected pass beyond second point last reached speck resembling human seen coast length many miles 
hope murmured bladud 
none returned captain 
little maikar speak expression countenance showed opinion 
resumed captain brief silence would starve must go straight back see whether provisions washed ashore 
however return spot landed knew current carried hapless comrades westward must borne remains wreck direction 
descending therefore foam covered bay referred searched margin carefully time found nothing even scrap wreck 
last give despair turn method obtaining food observed portion wreck driven high beach cleft rock 
running eagerly towards found plank 
bladud captain looked moment two silence maikar gave vent groan disappointment 
never mind said prince lifting plank laying shoulder quiet thoughtful way peculiar serve make fire keep us warm 
need kept warm weather fine hot said maikar rueful expression 
moreover need food eat plank prince reply led way towards neighbouring cliff 
think better make fire woods bladud asked captain 
would oblige one us watch case natives wolves attack us none us fit state watch 
must sleep 
sleep without first eating said maikar remonstrative tone 
go woods first try catch something foot run hare deer bear wild boar even rabbit legs swift enough though short equal 
well neither bow shaft good sword would little use game waste time strength woods might find honey suggested maikar 
find honey berries answered little man 
berries nearly ripe yet 
true forgot 
say know man interposed captain laugh never ashamed confessing ignorance regard things bound know 
lead bladud follow 
know woodcraft either us 
sea battle would claim lead 
land babe freely resign helm one knows steer 
agreeing arrangement bladud led companions steep face cliff projecting ledge reached wide enough form camping ground perpendicular cliff back sides precipitous render approach enemies whether two four legged exceedingly difficult 
piling stones head path reached rendered impossible one approach without awakening sleepers 
bladud using sword hatchet chipped pieces plank directed companions cut away wet parts reduce dry parts shavings 
obeyed order silence wonderingly fire seemed useless encampment well sheltered wind said weather warm 
means cord rude bow drill made piece dry wood leader soon procured fire minutes bright flame illumined persons cliff behind 
shades evening falling time aspect things much improved change 
comrades said prince undoing breast tunic drawing either side flat mass dark substance resembled old dried cow hide shall supper rest 
dried meat exclaimed little maikar eyes indeed whole visage blazing delighted surprise 
right 
maikar 
knew would hungry got ashore caught two pieces meat stuffed breast leaving one arkal 
may quite enough perhaps hope keep quiet till morning 
nay shall content fair share may claim share hand procuring 
wise 
came think say truth lay claim neither wisdom forethought answered prince dividing food equal portions 
meat chanced lying close hand leap sea 
seen sooner would advised take way 
set cook 
feel sleepy half inclined eat raw 
jerked dried meat thus opportunely brought away may said half cooked drying process indeed sometimes eaten dried condition inconvenient cook 
minutes therefore supper ready minutes disposed strong jaws sound teeth good appetite make short work victuals 
time night set gale moderating stars come seemed every prospect speedy favourable change weather 
darkness came wolves creatures night furred feathered 
former party protected steep ascent barricade latter kept swooping darkness ever anon glaring moment round inquiring eyes sweeping affrighted unearthly silence 
little heed paid sights sounds however adventurers filled sadness loss ship comrades 
spoke little meal partially drying lay feet towards fire almost instantly fell asleep 
trained hardy life feel want couch covering healthy exhaustion prevented dreams disturbing repose 
gradually fire died howling wolves ceased night birds betook haunts sound heard around camp except soft breathing sleepers booming distant waves 
chapter six 
first anxieties troubles 
day followed wreck well advanced sleepers awakened 
first thoughts thankfulness escaped life 
arose feelings loneliness sorrow sad fate crew penelope though possible comrades reached shore beach extended westward event probable 
still bare hope induced rise haste 
hurried breakfast remnants previous night supper proceeded along coast several miles carefully searching shores every bay 
noon halted 
scraps dried meat still remained dined sitting grassy slope consulted future proceedings 
done asked captain bladud seated silence minutes 
would rather hear opinion first returned friend 
must still continue act captain fitting age sit helm act part guide forester seeing somewhat accustomed woodcraft 
remainder band said little maikar wiping mouth finishing last morsel sit judgment deliberations 
returned bladud 
wisdom said lies small compass find 
captain arkal whose knitted brows downcast eyes showed thoughts busy looked suddenly 
likely said ships come near coast gale driven us far usual track trading ships towns large small know 
would useless therefore remain hope picked passing vessel 
walk back home east next impossible far distant lie us hellas far reaching gulfs bays besides great mountain ranges never yet crossed tops clouds covered summer winter eternal snow 
hope remains us said maikar sigh except join wild people land people live die like savages 
patience maikar yet finished 
besides interpolated bladud wise judge never delivers opinion heard sides question 
knowledge lie coast lands feel sure isles cassiterides must lie continued captain pointing westward travel diligently unlikely shall come upon coast land almost opposite 
may find perhaps make boat could cross sea part narrow white cliffs land easily distinguished 
doubt shall find ship belonging one countrymen take maikar back homes prince doubtless able return father court foot 
seen speech phoenician captain included southern shore england idea cassiterides 
notion direction islands lay however somewhat incorrect founded partly experience partly also misconception prevalent time islands referred lay little way north spain 
plan seems good one said bladud thought help thinking quite right notion direction tin islands 
left albion kept careful note daily runs somewhat curious points opinion lie 
pointed almost due north 
captain smiled shook head 
bladud looked maikar also smiled shook head 
want opinion said little man gravely two great good wise men differ widely likely truth lies somewhere 
judgment therefore cassiterides lie yonder 
pointed air confidence north west direction 
seem said bladud maikar right seem equally confident views captain middle course may safest 
however decide otherwise course submit 
nay returned captain abuse power given 
let us decide matter lot 
ay let us draw lots echoed maikar shove matter shoulders shoulders chance 
thing chance said bladud soliloquising tone 
however let wish 
recognize justice two voices overriding one 
lots drawn accordingly longest fell little seaman 
without discussion therefore course suggested adopted 
comrades said prince rising drawing knife like sword procured egypt white metal must set work make bows arrows animals wont walk man request killed cooked long maikar shouting food 
sorry good javelin grandfather went carcase pirate chief remarked captain also rising seems way handled bladud could killed deer well men 
killed deer truly arrow handier surer 
ay sure hand good eye direct returned arkal make pretence either 
ship indeed manage hit cool often case fight men shafts quite thrown away deer boars birds make nothing 
mistake maikar much better bow 
worse observed little man quietly 
well said bladud laugh must make hunter party 
conversing thus entered forest soon found trees suitable purpose cut boughs using swords hatchets 
already shown prince brought sword shield knife shore 
captain arkal maikar also saved swords knives attached girdles time leaped wreck 
somewhat inferior weapons worn bladud made bronze 
swords seamen unlike prince short double edged shaped somewhat like used long afterwards romans made weight lacked sharpness 
take many hours party direction prince form three strong serviceable bows several arrows latter feathered dropped plumes shod flint according fashion times 
bowstrings made first tough fibrous roots tree split threads plaited together 
course good deer sinews purpose remarked bladud stringing one bows fitting arrow must content kill deer animal 
perhaps shall opportunity soon 
remark seemed prophetic last word passed lips fawn trotted glade right front party stood paralysed surprise 
captain maikar reduced much condition made attempt use bows 
ho exclaimed former got moment bladud bow twanged arrow quivered breast fawn fell dead without struggle 
well done exclaimed captain heartily 
luck always attends prince shall fare well journey 
altogether luck returned 
see spot bark yonder tree size maikar mouth gapes astonishment see clear enough stopped abruptly yet speaking arrow quivered center spot referred 
captain talked luck maikar shutting mouth snap felt words could justice feelings sprang hastened commence operation flaying cutting fawn 
thus provided food spent rest day preparing journey drying sun making tough serviceable bowstrings sinews fawn fitting arrow heads feathers otherwise arranging prolonged march country entirely unknown character inhabitants 
comes head said captain maikar must provide shields spears sort people land warlike may defend 
say returned prince rising spoke going towards long straight bough neighbouring tree fixed critical gaze 
one sweep heavy sword severed stem returned companions 
taken ill tree testing strength arm asked maikar 
neither friend must javelin make equipment complete would advise captain provide like weapons may meet four footed well two legged foes parts 
show point things flint

chapter seven 
converse adventures way 
day beginning break east prince raised head bundle leaves formed pillow looked sleepily around 
companions lay still sound asleep sprawling abandon characteristic heroes antiquity 
characteristics wonderfully similar modern heroes 
instance captain lay flat back mouth wide open musical solo proceeding nose maikar lay side knees doubled arms extended full length front hands tightly clasped pleading one mercy suddenly petrified fallen side 
rising softly bladud took bow quiver buckling sword left encampment without disturbing sleepers 
proceeded mile startled several wild turkeys birds species rest 
one instantly brought 
following soon shot another returned camp found comrades left musical nose anything emphatic 
although naturally grave man bladud means destitute sense humor disinclined occasion perpetrate practical joke 
contemplating sleepers moment retired paces concealed long grass position pitched one huge birds air fell captain upturned visage 
snore changed yell alarm mariner sprang grasped sword course lay handy beside 
electrified yell maikar also leaped feet sword hand 
ye mean cried captain turning fiercely 
mean replied maikar equal ferocity 
barely uttered words second turkey hit full face tumbled ashes fortunately extinguished fire 
come come interposed prince stepping forward deprecating smile quarrelling among friends especially beginning long journey 
see fetched breakfast 
instead tumbling fire putting maikar think would wiser see spark left blow flame 
quick hungry 
need hardly said orders received laugh prompt obedience part little man 
yes fire said blowing tremendous energy flame produced 
know something within loud voice utters one word food food food may get birds ready fire ready two winks 
occasion however give advice friends already birds plucked split open breast laid flat interiors scraped summary manner 
plucking indeed could wished fingers failed singe flames accomplished perfect satisfaction men way particular 
sharp pointed sticks thrust expanded carcases stuck front blaze roast 
underdone meat abomination luxury others reminding one ancient proverb tastes differ 
say whether occasion uniformity action heroes result taste haste certain fowls half roasted one side turned let fire get breakfast begun meat yet frightfully underdone 
thereafter three men arose like giants refreshed may say maikar indeed mentally though physically giant buckled swords slung bows quivers backs along turkey remains took shields javelins 
laid course stars night set journey unknown wilderness 
part country passed beginning march broken diversified hill dale places clothed forests others covered grass many wild animals seen browsing 
however remarkably timid fled first sign approaching travellers impossible get within bow shot 
judge much hunted said bladud halting ridge note wild flight herd deer caught eight 
likely fall hunters long fear remarked captain 
fear asked maikar 
may numerous savage may take fancy make slaves us number three could resist fancy without losing lives 
would pity returned maikar one life lose 
three lives lose amongst us objected captain 
makes one retorted seaman 
true maikar must lose rather become slaves 
right captain 
never never shall slaves said bladud 
say history repeats 
perhaps sentiment 
events british prince gave utterance day well known sentiment embalmed modern song shouted many briton tremendous enthusiasm though absolute truth

stars alike ye understand fool could understand well course understand 
noticed doubt stars groups groups may alter position regard groups never change regard

well star shows exactly cold regions lie extending arm pointing course know cold regions lie know hot regions must lie back follows pillars hercules lie pointing west home lies somewhere pointing eastward
