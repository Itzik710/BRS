fortunately maggie deep sense humor hardly resented even tactful hints dropped time time conventional part conversation effect christianity course played higher light dawned 
mrs stapleton quite say outright amounted much 
even laurie came downstairs appeared lady go church yet broad mindedness object

maggie irrepressible burst internal laughter however gave hint presence steady features 
glanced laurie eating mutton depressed air 
talking mr vincent great spiritualist went vivaciously last week 
heard mrs baxter suggesting place great emotions felt colored stained objectively old walls weather beaten 
interesting conversation cardinal newman subject smiled brilliantly maggie reassure orthodoxy scarcely six weeks ago 
pregnant silence

mrs baxter looked helplessly girl maggie came rescue 
sounds rather advanced us said

limitations removed going another room 
together hands father maggie recognized jetsam christian science 
death paul says thy sting grave thy victory mrs stapleton flashed radiant look helpfulness round faces lingering instant laurie leaned back 
followed silence

guest rose brilliant patient smile swept 
maggie crossed looked laurie 
boy expression half disgust half interest eyelids sank little rose 
maggie went others 
ii dreadful woman observed mrs baxter half hour later two strolled back garden path seeing mrs stapleton wave delicately gloved hand encouragingly back throbbing motor

drew cigarette lighted 
know lot people think something said 
spiritualism 
daresay said maggie 
perceived corner eye laurie looked suddenly sharply 
loathed little knew subject cordially completely could hardly put words 
nine tenths believed fraud matter wigs indian muslin cross lights tenth generous estimate affair dingiest foulest backstairs life 
prophetic outpourings mrs stapleton altered opinion 
oh feel like went laurie 
turned 
laurie said think perfectly detestable 
acknowledge know much little know enough thank 
laurie smiled faintly patronizing way 
well said indulgently think much use discussing 
indeed said maggie nose air 
much said sounds stamping whoaing stable yard presently sent girl indoors hurry 
mrs baxter still mildly querulous drive 
appeared maggie perceived kind veiled insult things talked house seem fit scheme universe 
mrs baxter knew perfectly well every soul left world went either called paradise extremely exceptional cases place name places way entirely absorbed attention inhabitants 
established view members spiritual world apart unhappy ones kind anglicans minds doubt enlarged considerably original lines 
tales like cardinal newman therefore extremely tiresome upsetting 
maggie theology also also appeared quite impossible cardinal newman frequent drawing room mr vincent order exchange impressions mrs stapleton elementary answer 
thing simply untrue end 
found difficult therefore follow companion train thought 
said demanded mrs baxter presently 
understand ideas materialism 
think called materialization explained maggie patiently 
said things favorable medium good one soul wanted communicate could make kind body called astral matter medium sitters 
surely bodies like say think 
said 
dear please explain 
want understand woman 
maggie frowned little 
well first thing said souls want communicate begin generally things like table rapping making blue lights 
know go 
sometimes gain control medium trance speak write hand 
things favorable begin draw matter make kind body thin ethereal pass hand 
things get better better go still make body solid touch sometimes rather dangerous still sort way connected medium 
think idea 
good well see mrs stapleton thinks really souls world tell us kinds things true

mrs baxter often stop vicarage altogether approve vicar wife 
good deal pride old lady seemed occasionally mrs rymer understand difference hall parsonage 
envied sometimes secretly romanist idea celibacy much easier get spiritual adviser consider wife 
matter clergyman must settle put slight air dignity became well little four clock victoria turned steep little drive led vicarage 
iii thee dusk already fallen laurie strolling vaguely garden heard carriage wheels draw gate outside 
ridden alone mind run certain extent might expected upon recent guest startling conversation 
intelligent young man least taken pseudo mystical remarks 
yet something extreme assurance affected man may smile sourly good story bad taste 
attitude fact christians circumstances 
instant believe things really literally happened yet difficult advance absolutely conclusive argument 
merely come way appeared conflict experience usually found advocates persons mrs stapleton 
two things however prevailed keep matter mind 
first sense loss experience sore hot within unapproachable emptiness death second maggie attitude 
plainly sensible controlled young woman takes position superiority apt unless young man company happens love sometimes even provoke irritate camp opposition 
still apt relations line even greater tenderness 
laurie favorable moods receive dicta vicar 
announced immediately mrs baxter received maggie hands first cup tea 
mr rymer tells nonsense said 
laurie looked 
said 
mr rymer tells spiritualism nonsense

laurie took bun thoughtful air 
mr rymer know much think mother dear boy think knows anyone need know 
besides come think could cardinal newman possibly appear drawing room particularly mrs stapleton says christian longer 
possible rather pleasing double interpretation laurie decided worth humorous 
witch endor asked innocently instead 
old testament answered mother rapidly 
mr rymer said something 
oh really samuel appeared mr rymer thinks things permitted permitted 
laurie drank cup tea 
humiliating fact extreme grief often renders mourner rather cross 
distinct air crossness laurie moment

went door easy rather long steps disappeared 
heard steps inner hall 
door closed overhead 
mrs baxter contentedly poured another cup tea 
poor boy said 
thinking girl still 
glad got something occupy mind 
end room first floor laurie possession 
big place two windows large open fire skillfully masked fact bedroom disposing furniture help screen manner completely hide bed washing arrangements 
rest room furnished pleasing male kind fashion big couch drawn across fire writing table chairs deep easy chair near door long high bookcase covering wall door windows 
college oar hung pleasant groups pictures scattered walls 
maggie often come except invitation seven clock evening half hour go dress thought would look minutes 
still little uncomfortable quite know ridiculous told sensible boy like laurie could seriously affected considered wicked nonsense spiritualism 
yet went telling laurie grief excuse showing little marked friendliness 
besides would like ask whether really going back town thursday 
tapped twice answer came seemed rather breathless voice spoke 
boy sitting bolt upright edge sofa couple candles side book hands 
strained intensely interested look eyes 
may come minutes nearly dressing time said

think said nodding book 
filled lungs smoke exhaled slowly 
think extraordinary said shortly 
way paused answering 
answered deliberately 
human evidence worth anything things happen said 
things dead return 
maggie looked aware deliberate attempt dramatic brevity 
watching end cigarette elaborate attention face white rather determined look seen twice presence domestic crisis 
really mean believe said touch careful bitterness voice 
said else well else human evidence worth nothing 
maggie understood perfectly realized occasion force issues 
still put tone faint irony voice 
really believe cardinal newman comes mr vincent drawing room raps tables really believe possible get touch call dead 
instance course depends evidence 
cardinal newman studied evidence cardinal newman remarked laurie head voice 
let look book said maggie impulsively 
handed began turn pages pausing read particular paragraph nearly minute examined illustration 
certainly book seemed interestingly written read argument two appeared reasonably presented 
yet extraordinarily repelled even dead paper ink hands 
something obscene 
finally tossed back couch 
laurie waited said nothing 
well asked last still refraining looking 
think horrible said 
laurie delicately adjusted little tobacco protruding cigarette 
little unreasonable asked 
hardly looked yet 
maggie knew mood well 
reserved occasions determined fight 
argument useless weapon 
dear boy said effort sorry 
daresay unreasonable 
kind thing seem disgusting 
come talk tell said laurie 
maggie silent 
well yes 
want 
laurie smiled might seen 
well else want say glanced purposely book 
maggie ignored glance 
came see getting 
mean book every way 
looked swiftly suddenly saw agony sorrow acute beneath attempts superiority courteous fractiousness set face 
filled suddenly enormous pity 
oh laurie sorry cried 
anything nothing thanks nothing said quietly 
pity misery surged within cast prudence winds 
realized fond boy till saw look eyes 
oh laurie know like know sorry 
spoil said wildly hardly knowing feared 
beg pardon know mean 
spoil fancying things 
maggie said boy quietly must let alone 
help 
help repeated 
must go way 
please say 
stand 
followed dead silence 
maggie recovered stood 
rose 
forgive laurie must say 
remember always anything gone 
iv ladies went bed early stantons 
ten clock precisely clinking bedroom candlesticks heard hall followed sound locking doors 
signal 
mrs baxter laid aside embroidery punctuality religious sound bell said two words dears 
occasionally exclamatory expostulations two piquet table nine cases ten game designed eye upon clock hardly delay followed 
mrs baxter kissed son passed arm maggie laurie followed gave candles generally took one 
evening piquet 
laurie stayed later usual dining room wandered rather restlessly joined others 
looked london evening paper little paced vanished returned ladies making ready depart 
gave candlesticks came back drawing room 
fact far perturbed excited mood even maggie idea 
interrupted half way book read steadily five minutes dinner indeed gone back finish afterwards 
finished wanted think 
surprising effect coming upon state mind intensely stirred depths sorrow 
crossness said natural psychological result emotions emotions none less real 
froth whipped cream real cream 
laurie seen perfectly well extreme unconvincingness mrs stapleton genuine enough little shrug disapproval answer maggie lunch yet lady remarks sufficient ignite train thought 
train smoldered afternoon fanned ever slightly two breezes sense maggie superiority faint rebellious reaction come upon regard personal religion 
certainly mass said amy morning almost superstitious rather religious instinct 
fact state religious unreality occasionally comes upon converts within year two change faith 
impetus old association absent force novelty died 
underneath must remembered one thing intensely real sense loss one soul wrapped 
even afternoon yesterday even morning lay awake conscious irresistible impulse demand sign catch glimpse denied 
mood read book wondered excited 
opened beneath sham mysticism intolerable affectations grotesque parody spirituality largely aware glimmering avenue faintly possible hope never dreamed hope least half self deception tempting certain characters 
book written living man whose name address given stories startling theories apparently consonant partly known facts stories theories met precisely overmastering desire little wonder affected 
naturally even reading thousand answers adverse comments sprung mind suggestions fraud lying hallucination yet possibility remained 
living men women usual complement senses reason declared categorically detail date place taken possible precautions fraud received messages dead messages purport understood none seen eyes sufficient light actual features dead loved even clasped hands held instant bodies seen die eyes buried 
ladies footsteps ceased sound overhead laurie went french window opened passed lawn 
astonished warmth september night 
little wind chilly afternoon dropped coming dark high overhead could see great masses leaves motionless sky 
passed round house beneath yews sat garden bench 
darker outside lawn 
beneath feet soft needles trees looked still sunk thought could see glimmer star two branches 
fragrant kindly night 
hamlet half dozen houses beyond garden came sound house still behind 
illuminated window somewhere first floor went looked like soul leaving body sleepy bird somewhere shrubbery chirped mate silent 
still labored argument putting weighing emotion rose irresistible torrent consideration ceased 
one thing remained must amy must die 
five six minutes moved attitude clenched hands tensely strung muscles sudden passion cast 
minutes willed whole power come warm fragrant darkness hidden eyes sweet silence round sleep kept guard 
things happened things must happened love man mightiest forces creation 
surely happened must somewhere world man man called back dead husband sobbing silently dark child wailing mother surely force world history willed back mysterious dark space dear personality even heaven could give even compelled semblance life sort body clothe 
things must happened secrets well kept 
boy willed yet dark remained empty shadow faintly outlined face even instant blotted star stared touch shoulder whisper ear 
seemed strove silence must done limit power concentrated intense 
yet happened shuddered little shudder fear touch delicious trembling expectation 
yet happened 
laurie relaxed muscles therefore let breath exhale long sigh remembered book read mrs stapleton feverish self conscious thought

real agnostic matter 
read several books impressed 
great deal seems nonsense perhaps better say understand 
materializing business instance understand minds dead affect see affect matter table rapping instance still appearing able touch see think position ended rather lamely 
fact little disconcerted eyes

mr vincent sat motionless little speech looking offensively yet effect making young man feel rather like defiant naughty little boy trying explain 
laurie sat back drew cigarette rather hard 
understand perfectly said steady voice

theologians believe tell us thing except peculiar circumstances lives saints 
bound believe theologians say asked quietly 
well would rash indeed began laurie

approach side try find instead whether things actually happen 
wish rude mr baxter remember theologians foolish say church know theologians know made mistake galileo 
laurie winced little 
mr jamieson cleared throat gentle approval 
ask accept anything contrary faith went gently really wish look matter must set aside present presuppositions 
must begin assuming theologians always right even asking things happen 
one point happen last words curious little effect sudden flame 
spoken smoothly quietly suddenly put unexpected emphasis little sentence end 
laurie jumped internally 
yes point assented internally 
went slow reassuring voice flicking ash cigarette possible doubt things happen may ask books read laurie named three four 
convinced altogether 
yet accept human evidence great many much remarkable things catholic

heavy beard brows hid half face whole glowed passionately voice even little trembling gestures laurie sat astonished 
every word uttered seemed fit case express almost perfect vehicle vague thoughts struggled heart last week 
amy man spoke amy eyes hair peering glorious gloom catch glimpse lover meaningless light earthly day 
mr vincent cleared throat little sound two motionless women stirred rustled little 
sound hansom spanking trot wintry jingle bells swelled distance passed went silence spoke

desires communicate one loves earth human innocent desire 
yet lost connection machinery spoken connection know nothing matter spirit except exists 
well least bend every power possesses upon medium mean matter alone communication made man island beyond power human voice use instrument however grotesque signal passing ship 
would decent man mr baxter mock pathos effort even grotesque thing like flannel shirt end oar yet men mock tapping table well longing soul uses every means disposal concentrates every power possesses 
unreasonable unchristian dishonoring love god think sometimes succeeds able comparatively exceptional circumstances establish connection material things perfectly normal natural earthly life tell mr baxter

six weeks since experience queen gate gone variety emotions 
bewildered terror first nervous interest next truculent skepticism third lately astonishment nervous interest begun revive 
first filled unreasoning fear 
walked back far gate park hardly knowing went conscious must company fellows upon finding south side hyde park corner travelers crossed nervous haste might jostle human beings 
dined restaurant knowing band would playing drunk bottle champagne gone rooms cheered excited leapt instantly bed fear courage evaporate 
perfectly aware fear sickening kind repulsion formed large element emotions 
nearly two hours unless three persons lied consummately essential sleepless self underlies strange company become identified horrible manner soul dead person 
informed morning slept night corpse bed 
woke half dozen times night pleasant curtained bedroom time terror upon 
stories true thing still haunted air remarkable considered afterwards sign demanded effect hoped 
reassured 
days went left peace horror began pass 
turned thing mind dozen times day found absorbing 
began reflect nothing way evidence 
hypnotic sleep might explain whole thing 
little revelation made unconsciousness sitting beneath yews might easily accounted fact knew deeper element experience known told aloud 
proof anything 
remained rapping medium called appearance sleep read books 
convinced previously besides surely doubtful whether rapping really taken place might normal cracks sounds woodwork intensified attention listeners proof might produced way intense power living person present surely conceivable conceivable hypothesis besides got amy within week original experience skepticism dominant 
lines thought work incessant repetition 
normal life lived large businesslike face lawyer faced day day theater two couple dinners even noise london streets appearance workaday persons gradually reassured 
therefore received nervous little note lady laura reminding ance held baker street begging attendance wrote proper letter back thanking kindness saying come conclusion kind thing good work begging make excuses mr vincent 
week two passed nothing whatever happened 
heard lady laura answered polite refusal adding little state mind silence fell 
last mr vincent called person one evening dinner

back confusion thought escaped 
definite test offered least good faith test lacking doubt whatever would borne facts 
conceivable hypothesis would explain except one offered confidently grave dignified man sat looked something interested compassion heavy eyes coincidence absurd

mrs baxter gone bed half hour 
wickedly grotesque said indignantly 
seriously believe poor amy soul entered mind hour half lady laura drawing room 
purgatory heaven utterly ridiculously impossible speak patience 
laurie smiled rather wearily contemptuously 
point said simplest hypothesis believe soul somewhere natural want oh dash maggie think remember love well added 
maggie made tiny mental note 
deny instant odd story said 
kind explanation oh speak 
allowed last thing really believe coincidence whole thing turned upside 
laurie wish reasonable 
laurie glanced 
sitting back curtained shuttered window beyond lay yew walk lamplight tall stand fell full upon 
dressed rich darkish material breast veiled filmy white stuff round strong arms lay bare elbow along arms chair 
pleasant wholesome sight 
face troubled great serene eyes serene usual 
astonished persistence attacked 
whole personality seemed thrown eyes gestures quick words 
maggie said please listen 
told actually convinced 
say conceivably possible

threw head back chair remained looking ceiling 
think souls dead ah repulsive outside night still 
hard frost kept world iron bound sprinkle snow last two three days afternoon thaw begun 
twice dinner come thud masses snow falling roof lawn outside clear sparkle candles seemed little dim hazy 
would comfort get garden reflected 
two sat windless silence thaw became apparent every instant 
silence profound little noises night outside drip eaves slow deliberate rustle released leaves even gentle thud lawn yew branches helped emphasize stillness 
like murmur day rather like gnawing mouse wainscot death chamber 
requires almost superhumanly strong nerves sit night conversation kind opposite apparently reasonable person white twitching terror even though one resolutely refrains looking without slightly affected 
one may argue oneself extent tap one foot cheerfully floor fill mind painstakingly normal thoughts yet something conflict however victorious one may 
even maggie became aware 
one single moment allowed two little sudden noises room could possibly proceed cause whatever except stated relaxation stiffened wood influence thaw 
laurie arguments prevailed shake smallest degree resolute conviction nothing whatever preternatural certainly queer story 
yet sat lamplight laurie speechless great curtained window behind became conscious uneasiness could entirely repel 
physical said result change weather silence fallen proximity terrified boy 
looked across 
lying back old green arm chair eyes rather shadowed lamp overhead quite still quiet hands still clasping lion bosses chair arms

necessarily childish 
dream tonight chair dinner 
well laurie began 
ten minutes talked without ceasing 
mr vincent smoked tranquilly putting seemed laurie quite unimportant questions nodding gently time time 
frightened ended laurie want tell means 
drew long inhalation pipe expelled leaned back 
oh comparatively common said common people temperament mr baxter mine tell prayer enabled get end interesting 
fancy mean ordinary dream oh yes objective 
real experience 
mean mr baxter listen minute two 
ask questions like end 
first catholic told believe say among things spiritual world real thing always present less 
well course agree though agree altogether geography details world 
believe take world continually us room speak great deal senses tell us us always multitude influences good bad indifferent really present spirits suppose said laurie 
begin 
two kinds dreams 
stating belief mr baxter 
make comments like afterwards 
one kind dream entirely unimportant merely hash r chauff e thoughts little things experienced reappear hopeless sort confusion 
kind dream forget altogether generally five minutes waking 
another kind dream forget 
leaves vivid impression upon us waking experience actual incident 
exactly 
understand 
ever heard subliminal consciousness mr baxter medium smiled 
fortunate said 
run death well put untechnical way 
part us lies ordinary waking thoughts part us dreams reside habits take shape instincts intuitions rest generated 
well ordinary dreams asleep part active 
pot boils speak uncontrolled reason 
madman man part supreme waking life well 
well part us communicate spiritual world 
let us say two doors leads senses come waking experiences stored door yes medium hesitated 
well said natures instance mr baxter door opens rather easily 
door went think call dream 
said quite unlike ordinary dreams 
yes 
sure since experience exactly many others circumstances 
laurie moved uncomfortably chair 
quite understand said sharply 
mean dream certainly 
least dream ordinary sense 
actual experience 
asleep 
certainly 
one usual conditions almost indispensable condition fact 
objective self mean ordinary workaday faculties lulled subjective self call like real self essential self survives death self simply went inner door saw seen 
laurie looked intently 
touch apprehension face 
mean said slowly saw limitations space forth facts fancies certainly 
theology hint something kind laurie silent 
idea theology told point 
people experience asked suddenly 
medium smiled 
tell said 
one man artist another matter temperament 
see begun develop temperament last marked one begin 
laurie interrupted 
yes yes said 
another point 
fear tried awaken passed medium face shade gravity 
shade 
reached rather quickly pipe laid aside blew carefully answering 
said seemed boy affected carelessness 
oh common experience 
think much mr baxter 
never healthy sorry said laurie deliberately 
must ask tell think 
must know 
medium filled pipe 
twice began speak checked long silence laurie felt fears gather upon tenfold 
please tell mr vincent said 
unless know everything known go another step along road 
really mean 
medium paused pipe filling 
tell said slow virile voice 
sure turned back well known danger avoided prudence certainly shall turn back 
well mr baxter take word ever heard phrase watcher threshold laurie shook head 
said 
least think 
well said medium quietly call fear spoke interrupt 
tell know 
much 
paused stretched hand matches took one 
laurie watched fascinated action 
outside roared oxford street one long rolling sound sea within quiet retired silence boy noticed company 
fancy wondered medium lit pipe leaned back 
tell know said quietly 
much 
really phrase used sums pretty well 
tried get beyond world sense become aware certain facts world generally knows nothing 
one facts door life guarded certain know really nothing except presence causes appalling fear experience 
set god knows main business seems restrain possible entering body left 
occasionally presence perceived side often 
present death beds seen seen oh yes 
seen dying person 
usually glimpse might said mistake 
believe appalling terror shows even people fear death perfectly resigned nothing conscience well personally believe fear comes sight personage 
laurie licked dry lips 
told believe one word 
evil asked 
shrugged shoulders 
relative term said 
one point view certainly necessarily 
good medium smiled little 
question soon cease ask 
must remember hardly know anything yet 
one thing seems certain investigate point view one even principal one 
christianity fancy says thing glory god whatever may comes even salvation souls 
laurie wrenched attention focus 
danger said 
certainly 
always danger mean prayed ah another question short succeeded getting past well failed 
fell silence 
seemed laurie world falling 
yet far sure whether illusion 
extreme quietness confidence man enunciating startling theories effect 
practically impossible boy sit still nervous experience hear unmoved apparently reasonable connected account things certainly incomprehensible hypothesis 
remembrance startling uniqueness dream still vivid surely fitted yet one thing broke medium quiet voice 
ever experience kind thing recommend pray 
exercise individuality assert lean another 
quite strong enough 
mean mean exactly say 
called prayer really imaginative concession weakness 
take short cut rather 
assert individuality 
laurie changed attitude 
uncrossed feet sat little 
oh pray want said medium 
must remember mr baxter quite exceptional person 
assure conception powers 
must say hope take strong line 
paused 
ances instance 
know little dangers going turn back overhung kindly eyes looked keenly instant boy restless face 
know said laurie must think got 
look mr vincent said seems extraordinarily er extraordinarily plausible 
even quite sure whether going mad 
like perfectly mad dream things one top 
paused looking sharply elder man away 
yes laurie began finger pencil lay chimney shelf 
see mean said 
disputing er point view sincerity 
wish would give another proof two 
enough oh suppose reasonable 
know seems suddenly demonstrated twice two made five 
surely proof yes know 
quite see 
yet want one something quite absolutely ordinary 
things spirits rest something ever much simpler beyond mistake oh daresay 
ask yet another know 
think hypnotized laurie shook head 
fool said 
give pencil said medium suddenly extending hand 
laurie stared moment 
handed pencil 
little table arm chair couple feet laurie stood whisky apparatus box cigarettes 
medium without moving chair lifted set floor beside leaving woven grass surface table entirely bare

large piece furniture brought room rest furniture takes upon different value 
picture well fire place must perhaps moved 
values relations balance require readjustment 
last night laurie indeed convinced one sense spiritualistic phenomena yet reached point significance affected everything else 
new sideboard speak brought room put temporarily wall vacant space looked owner room yet realized necessity rearranging whole 
last night something happened changed 
beginning perceive need complete review everything 
lay quiet indeed startlingly alert first reviewed single fact 
hour passed away anything particular happened 
sat four complete silence hands upon table occasionally shifting little hearing sound one another breathing faint rustle one ladies dresses sufficient light screened fire single heavily shaded electric burner recognize faces even first minutes distinguish small objects read large print

sat thoughts first racing brain time went moving slowly brain becoming ever passive last compelled make little effort drowsiness begun envelop 
altogether three four times even begun wonder whether able resist much longer sudden trembling table awakened alert conscious moment sat every faculty violently attentive follow 
trembling curious sensation beneath hands 
first might caused passing heavy van street van 
increased spasms recoils till resembled continuous shudder living rigid body 
began also tilt slightly way 
laurie knew well meant nothing rather need 
movement passed reverse motions sinking last complete stillness conscious disappointment 
moment later however glanced medium cabinet drew breath sharply mr jamieson sound wheeled head swiftly look 
cabinet somewhere overhead behind curtain faint perfectly distinct radiance visible 
diffused glimmer unmistakable shone faintly clearly upon medium face 
light laurie could make every line every feature drooping clipped moustache strong jutting nose lines nostril mouth closed eyes 
watched light deepened intensity seeming concentrate hidden corner top 
smooth steady motion emerged full sight appearance like softly luminous globe pale bluish color undefined edges floating steadily forward motion like air balloon room

every single act therefore new significance 
venture indeed little opportunity heroism 
certain evidence senses death interlude life becomes merely part long process conduct life religion moment two laurie genuinely dismayed 
looked catholic religion perceived whole thing changed 
longer seemed august dominant 
contemplated mass previous morning seemed rather absurd 
trouble energy innumerable acts efforts faith religion seemed necessarily untrue certainly possible man hold simultaneously catholic spiritualistic beliefs hint last night christianity yet face evidence senses catholicism seemed shadowy thing 
might well true philosophy may true matter much enthusiastic frenzy artist loves portrait original possibly misleading inadequate portrait 
laurie seen original last night seen disembodied soul garb assumed purpose identification need religion experience sufficing suddenly speculation fled away presence personal element

considered liberty liked till dinner one 
rest day concern us 
looking round garden morning fine solid figure man rather baggy trousers short coat expansive waistcoat every button duty 
like mr james morton beat even narrower one barrister even better trodden never strayed except four short weeks summer hurried across ireland got late went picnics ecclesiastics straw hats joined cheerful songs evening 
priest perfectly defined duties admirable punctuality conscientiousness 
disliked english quite extraordinarily sense duty never suspected flock saxons adored people adore brisk businesslike man large heart peremptory ways guide father perfectly aware 
sermons consisted cold cut blocks dogma taken perseveringly sermon outlines served sunday sunday sauce slight delightful brogue 
could never kindled thames indeed river could bridge solid stones perhaps even desirable 
maggie begun disliking 
thought rather coarse stupid changed mind 
may called subtle patience things scruples nuances shades tone meaning put plain question plainly gave plain answer knew looked always relief intricate world 
maggie therefore bother much went plain issues respected liked accordingly 
good morning child said loud breezy voice came find hideous little sitting room

seems sensible fellow said 
ah wanted ask father

think need afraid said 
course know souls come back like 
somewhere else 
fraud practically fraud said superstitious forbidden church 
straight enough 
least clear issue begin attack laurie upon 
evil said 
real power underneath mr rymer said mrs baxter always thought 
priest face became theological 
let see sabetti says said 
fancy turned chair fetched volume behind 
ran finger heavy paragraphs turned page two began running comment translation necromantia ex necromancy arising invocation dead let see yes spiritism consulting spirits order know hidden things especially pertain future life certainly divination properly called full even impiety magnetism use turning tables 
reason baltimore fathers testify knowledge must necessarily ascribed satanic intervention since manner explained 
began maggie 
one moment child yes 
express divination 
ah tacit divination even openly protested commerce demon intended per se grave sin sometimes excused mortal sin account simplicity ignorance lack certain faith 
see child set book back place far fraud diabolical 
end 
think fraud asked girl paling little 
laughed resonance warmed heart 
pay attention 
tell like said grave sin play get thinking devil everything 
maggie puzzled 
devil asked least case think smiled reassuringly

well rate small commentary present situation priest stopped look bulbs coming bed beside stooped breathing heavily smooth earth round one large finger 
spiritualistic nonsense course whole thing trick

yet unwholesome unhealthy 
worst converts could content sober workaday facts catholic creed 
must always running novelty mortal sin anyhow sinner faintest idea large dinner bell pealed back door priest went roast beef yorkshire pudding apple dumplings single glass port wine end 
iii strange maggie felt steadied encouraged presence something least resembling danger 
long laurie merely tiresome foolish distrusted made little rules resolutions deliberately kept interiorly detached 
something definite look sensitiveness vanished 
something trust decide 
father mahon given point work fact thing serious pursuit forbidden reality behind whether indeed reality allow consider 
laurie state nerves sufficiently troublesome bring letter friend guide state playing tricks forbidden ground enough 
interview father mahon precipitated half formed resolution tea went upstairs write mr cathcart 
unconventional thing sufficiently perturbed disregard drawback wrote sensible letter explaining first without names mentioned described adopted brother position indicated experiences occupied last page asking two three questions begging general advice 
mrs baxter displayed symptoms dinner girl recognized well enough 
comprised resolute avoidance laurie name funny stiff little air dignity touch patronage 
interpretation things old lady wish subject mentioned interiorly best ignore forget 
maggie felt vaguely comforted left freer hand 
lay awake long time night

still clung wrists looking struck paralysis fear change furious hostility flamed face 
lips writhed back half snarling half smiling let go let go hissed 
father laurie wrenched backwards striking chin knee

one moment thought going spring 
feet snarling 
silence interminable instant stream words scorching ferocious snarled like furious growling dog string blasphemies filth 
much understood

two stood 
words horrible hear silence horrible thousand times man faces suddenly opened door furnace sees white cavern within 
first speak 
better take care said 
iii scarcely knew found chair figure seated opposite 
seemed direct assault useless 
indeed longer capable making 
nausea returned sensation weakness 
knees still lax useless hand turned chair arm shook violently 
yet curious sense irresponsibility longer terror nothing overpowering weakness reaction 
sat back silence minutes looking fire figure opposite noticing however helplessness seemed gone 
hands dangled longer sat upright hands clasped yet curious look stiffness unnaturalness 
began deliberately attempt gather forces appeared lost nervous grasp faculties 
longer quick grip command begun 
passivity rather activity seemed strength suddenly appeared inevitably without movement sound began internally pray closing eyes careless indeed unfearing 
seemed one hope 
behind steady movement sufficient least elicit acts petition intellect observed thousand images thoughts 
perceived silence house breathless spring night outside considered mr cathcart inn across road mrs baxter upstairs contemplated future would morrow easter day past scarcely present 
relinquished plans intentions hopes leaned simply upon supernatural like tired child looked pictures 
remembering afterwards recalled fact process prayer seemed strangely tranquil consciousness rest recuperation marked traveler feels turns lighted house stormy night

engine running free clenches upon wheel cog 
moment aware opened eyes saw looking straight intently questioningly 
moment perceived first time conflict lay externally thought interior region wholly ignorant 
word action something else half understood struggle closed eyes quite new kind determination 
self command needed steady interior concentration forces 
began resolute wordless play dismissing series efforts intellectual images thought play seemed affected boy opposite new way

saw struck upon new path led somewhere 
must follow 
little sound roused opened eyes looked 
shifted position moment heart leapt hope 
sat leaning forward elbows knees head hands shaded lamplight seemed shaking 
moved rustle dress seemed reach 
glanced dropped head caught clear sight face 
laughing silently overpoweringly without sound moment nausea seized fiercely gasped catching throat stared bowed head shaking shoulders horror felt 
laughter worse little perceived unreality 
like laughing machine 
silence gave peculiar touch 
wrestled driving despair 
courage love 
leaned back without speaking closing eyes shut terror began desperately resolutely bend task 
little sound disturbed 
shifted position looking straight curious air detached interest 
face looked almost natural though still flushed forced laughter mirth gone 
spoke abruptly sharply tone man speaks tiresome child little conversation followed found taking part unnatural dream 
better take care said 
afraid

lay quite quietly watching tired eyelids still unshuttered windows splendid glow seen behind twisted stems front slender fairy forest birches side garden 
immediately outside window lay path deep yew needles ground ivy beyond wet lawn glistening strange mystical light morning 
need remember consider 
knew every step process night 
laurie lay opposite deep sleep head arm breathing deeply regularly little smoking room seen cigarettes laid ready coming last night 
still log alight hearth noticed 
got chair softly stiffly felt intolerably languid tired 
besides must disturb boy 
went knees infinite craft picked coal two fender dropped neatly core red heat still smoldered 
fragment wood detached fell sharp sound knew even without turning head boy awakened 
faint inarticulate murmur rustle long sigh 
turned round 
laurie lying back arms clasped behind head looking quiet meditative air 
appeared astonished perplexed 
little white looking tired light dawn eyes bright sure 
rose knees still silent stood looking looked back 
need speech 
one moments one even say words use one regards thing like stretch open country 
contemplation comment needed 
eyes wandered away presently tranquility brightening garden outside slowly awakening mind expanding within sent little scrap quotation answered 
yet early came sepulcher 
run mary spoke 
easter day laurie 
boy nodded gently saw eyes slowly closing yet half awake 
went past tiptoe window turned handle opened white tall framework like door 
gush air sweet wine laden smell dew spring flowers wet lawns stole meet blackbird shrubbery across garden broke song interrupted chattered melodiously scurried vanish long curve behind yews 
world beast bird still half awake hamlet outside fence beyond trees rose yet skein smoke sound feet upon cobbles 
time future presented 
minutes passed enough 
regarded indeed fact old man asleep inn old lady upstairs rehearsed nothing said 
even think hour whether go bed presently 
traced sequence thought scarcely gave glance past present absorbed even present fraction lay attention wet lawn brightening east cool air joy come morning enough 
came long sigh behind moment afterwards step upon floor laurie stood 
glanced sideways wondering instant whether mood grave tired boyish face answer enough 
met eyes let stray garden 
first speak 
maggie said think best never speak one another 
nodded went understand little 
wish understand 
shall ask questions nothing need said anybody 
agree agree perfectly said 
word mother course 
course 
two silent 
reality rather faculties memory consideration reality apprehended coming back girl beginning stir mind 
began gently without perturbation recall passed long crescendo previous months gathering mutter spiritual storm burst last night even roar flare storm mad instinctive fight conscious life identity struggled 
seemed storm like others material plane washed things clean discharged oppression half conscious 
neither alone emerged clear shining rain boy stood seemed share joy 
stood together spiritual garden lovely morning clumsy translation another tongue 
stirred air wine soul coolness clearness beyond thought radiance shone bathed within sunlight filtered water 
perceived experience initiation stood one transparent least transparent wondered whether would see confident 
space silence perceived understood perception everything 
saw flaws plainly cracks crystal yet matter crystal crystal waited confident understand 
one fraction mind broke 
first time since opened eyes heart began beat 
lain hidden long crushed stone seal bidden lie still yet held resolute unknown night gone asserted waited liberation 
yet dare began laurie 
glanced terrified lest heart declare plainly eyes lips saw still looked across garden yet seeing nothing thought written glory sky leaf grass 
face caught splendor east saw lines would tell always anguish come terror heart leapt side spite confidence bade fear lest mistake conventional shame say 
turned troubled eyes looked face looked trouble cleared 
maggie said 
epilogue worst said maggie four months later patient female friend adored confidante worst least sure believe even 
tell dear said girl 
two sitting delightfully contrived retreat cut lower end double hedge 
two sides rose masses august greenery hazel beech close roof walls summer house long path ran green gloom old brick steps beneath yews two girls rested pleasant apparatus tea silver china damask delightful barbaric contrast surroundings 
maggie looked marvelously well considering nervous strain come upon easter time 
collapsed altogether seemed easter week long rest one dear french convent week ago entirely forbidden nuns speak experiences soon heard rough outline 
mrs baxter spent time rather melancholy travel continent coming back evening 
seems exactly like bad dream said maggie pensively beginning measure tea small silver scoop 
oh mabel may tell exactly mind talk oh said girl little comfortable movement 
tea poured plates set ready hand maggie began 
seems perfectly dreadful doubts know queer seems 
kind thick hedge waved hand illustratively hazels beside kind thick hedge easter suppose illness nuns tell 
well like 
see laurie mr cathcart rest like figures moving beyond seem behaving rather madly saw something see oh hopeless well first theory little figures included really see something really something somebody makes dance like 
yes grammar understand well come back presently 
next theory maggie sipped tea meditatively next theory whole thing simple imagination rather imagination acting upon little facts coincidences perhaps little fraud 
know way jealous irritable way everything seems fit every single word person suspicious utters fits corroborates idea 
mere imagination real facts kind matter choose take facts one way another 
select arrange thing perfectly convincing 
yet know nine cases ten simply lie oh explain things certainly 
explain instance pencil affair stood end laurie eyes really stand 
says whole thing seems rather dim seen vivid dream 
one sugar things appearances laurie saw extraordinary effect finally upon 
oh yes time night easter eve mean absolutely certain thing real actually obsessed thing personality mean came instead somehow 
mr cathcart tells right well come presently 
happen certainly explain good many things one explain yet one instantly rush conclusion done devil 
people say know little indeed inner working selves 
instinct instance 
know nothing except 
inherited experience rather clumsy phrase piece paper gummed cover crack wall 
brings third theory 
maggie poured second cup tea 
third theory rather vague altogether 
yet see quite well may true one 
please interrupt till quite done 
got us certain powers understand 
instance thought projection 
shadow doubt 
sit send message thinking oh vaguely course 
another form mean sympathy intuition 
well know people think haunted houses explained 
murder going murderer murdered person probably fearfully excited anger fear 
means whole stirred right bottom hidden powers frightfully active 
well idea hidden powers almost like acids gas hudson tells us actually stamp upon room degree sympathetic person comes years afterwards perhaps sees whole thing happened 
acts upon mind first course outwards senses reverse order generally see things 
well illustration 
idea know whether things happened pencil rappings automatic writing right appearances laurie saw result inner powers look 
one person projects thought another arrives generally like faint phantom thing thinking 
thinking ace hearts see white rectangle red spot middle 
see well multiply hundred times one see might possible thought mr vincent laurie together might produce kind unreal phantom could even touched perhaps oh know 
maggie paused 
girl side gave encouraging murmur 
well said maggie slowly 
stupid yes first theory shows unreal 
forgotten 
well first theory dear brethren divides two heads first theory spiritualists secondly theory mr cathcart 
dear mabel even though believe one word says 
well spiritualist theory seems simple r rot 
mr vincent mrs stapleton rest really think souls people actually come back things really truly poor dear amy nugent led laurie dance 
quite quite certain true whatever else yes come coincidences presently 
possibly amy come back things hurt laurie horribly tried 
dear quite frank common little thing besides hurt hair head 
mr cathcart 
long pause 
small cat stepped suddenly hazel tangle behind eyed two girls 
quite noiselessly caught maggie eye opened mouth pathetic curve intended represent appeal 
darling cried maggie suddenly seized saucer filled milk set ground 
small cat stepped daintily set work 
yes said girl tentatively 
oh mr cathcart well must say theory fits father mahon says 
know theology say particular thing devil actually happened given instance really happen devil 
well mr cathcart idea 
long story mind 
first believes devil quite extraordinary way oh yes know real indeed 
believes air simply thick utmost get hold human beings 
yes suppose believe expect since quantity things like bad dreams used think devil turn indigestion rather skeptical 
well mr cathcart believes indigestion speak devil 
believes evil spirits us time trying get crack find one person produce lunacy must say seems rather odd way lunatics often become horribly blasphemous things like another shattered nerves 
take advantage says weak spot anywhere 
one easiest ways spiritualism 
spiritualism wrong know well enough wrong trying live life find things beyond us present 
wrong lowest estimate outraging human nature 
yes mabel phrase 
good intentions therefore protect us least 
go ances good intentions like like holding smoking concert powder magazine behalf orphan asylum 
least protection profane dear least protection open concert prayer 
got business 
blown 
danger oh danger mr cathcart says 
ances genuine automatic handwriting rest deliberately approach powers friendly way sort passivity got get open widely possible entrance 
often get bothered 
sometimes done 
particularly hard get 
course one senses especially decent people would dream knew meant 
creatures whatever may always pretend somebody else 
sharp pick kinds odds ends little tricks little facts impersonate someone inquirer fond say sorts pious happy little things first order lead 
go long time saying religion quite true 
way rather odd way catholic church seems one thing like almost anything else spiritualist catholic 
generally though tell say prayers sing hymns 
father mahon day arguing hymns church said heretics always went hymns go 
begin hint religion worth much attack morals 
mr cathcart tell said got bad could take care 
maggie paused looking rather serious 
voice risen little new color come face talked 
stooped pick saucer 
dearest better oh yes done said maggie briskly 
hardly 
well idea 
want get possession human beings move start like 
well mr cathcart says happened laurie 
one beasts came impersonated poor amy 
picked certain things appearance trick stammering playing fingers grave finally made appearance shape 
understand murmured girl 
oh dear bother 
lot astral substance 
besides mr cathcart says 
told sure believe one word 
idea 
maggie stopped suddenly leaned back staring luminous green roof hazels 
small cat could discerned half way leafy tunnel swaying body preparation pounce overhead sounded agitated twittering 
mabel seized pebble threw success swaying stopped reproachful cat face looked round 
said mabel comfortably well really think maggie smiled reflectively 
exactly know least 
said seems like dream bad one 
think nastiest thing added vindictively ever come across want hear one word long live 
oh dear sensible normal love ordinary little things garden chickens cat dog complaining butcher 
imagine anybody wants anything else 
yes suppose sort way believe mr cathcart 
seems granted spiritual world naturally grant far intelligent explanation 
seems intellectually far broad minded explanation really take facts facts accounts reasonably 
whereas subjective self business oh frightfully clever ingenious assume great deal 
seems rather like people say electricity accounts everything electricity imagination theory well appeals emotionally happen chickens butcher mood least convince 
yes suppose mr cathcart theory one ought believe way one believe least prevent feeling extraordinarily unreal impossible 
anyhow matter much 
leaned back comfortably smiling long silence 
divinely beautiful august evening 
sat little could seen except long vista path arched hazels whence cat disappeared ending three old brick steps wide flat lichened mossed set flower pots leading yew walk 
whole air full summer sound life scent heavy redolent streaming old box lined kitchen garden right beyond hedge orchard left 
kind atmosphere suggesting nature sensible mood full blooded normal perfectly fulfilling vocation utterly unmystical except subtle interpretation unsuggestive since already saying could said following every principle lived furthest confine contents 
presented kind rounded completion satisfactoriness suggested entirely sensuous comfortable person 
corners vistas hinting anything except perfectly normal lawn set garden mystery implication theory glimpse theory except proclaimed 
something air seemed breathe maggie expression contentment smiled softly happily clasping arms behind head 
looked perfectly charming thought mabel laid hand delicately friend knee share satisfaction verify participation speak 
seem done much harm said 
thank extremely well content 
looked door without least wishing least want look 
nice view 
er religion said younger girl rather awkwardly 
oh religion right said maggie 
church gives much good rest tells quiet bother peep pry 
listeners hear good suppose true senses 
rate going best mind nothing except business 
rather unenterprising certainly like oh mabel want absolutely ordinary rest life 
extremely rare original know 
somebody say nothing uncommon common sense well going 
genius understand kind infinite capacity taking pains sort 
sort infinite capacity without 
like wagner know 
well wish bach sort kind thing anyone ought able mabel smiled doubtfully 
lady laura saying began presently 
maggie face turned suddenly severe 
wish hear one word

hope spend rest days sackcloth scourge added 
oh tell mrs nugent evening laurie came home yes
