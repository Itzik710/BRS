later publication folio world seems taken interest literary matters 
mr greenwood says multitude would take ben jonson noble panegyric shakespeare poet au pied de la lettre enlightened would recognize esoteric meaning

enlightened aware ben said shakespeare swan avon meant somebody else

one may read mr greenwood three books note engaging varieties views vary suits argument unaware justify varyings 
thus one john davies wrote rhymes speaks english terence mr shakespeare good 
period patriotic english critics called comic dramatist english terence english plautus precisely american critics used call mr bryant american wordsworth cooper american scott scots called rev mr thomson scottish turner 
somewhere believe exists belgian shakespeare 
following practice davies call either english terence english plautus 
aristophanes would generally recognized like one ancient authors another 
thus davies apt choose either plautus terence even betting selected 
chanced choose terence curious suggests suspicions mr greenwood baconians 
full suspicions suit baconians mr greenwood find contemporary recognition author 
consequently mr greenwood finds davies curious first sight inappropriate comparison shake speare terence worthy remark terence author whose name alleged used mask name nom de plume writings great men wished keep fact authorship concealed 
davies felt bound bring roman parallel shakespeare choice terence plautus 
meres used plautus davies used terence 
mr greenwood j shows us plautus would 
could shakespeare write courtesans cocottes ladies highly born cultured refined supposed parallel plautus shakespeare breaks every point 
thus mr greenwood showing plautus could serve davies serve search roman parallel good 
mr greenwood also writes shakespeare likened latin comedian surely plautus writer compared 
k yet plautus man used parallel shakespeare 
course roman comic dramatist closely resembles author like 
selected either plautus terence meant celebrated comic dramatists 
plautus parallel 
yet surely plautus author compared davies says mr greenwood 
davies tried plautus comparison bad terence curious terence absurdly accused nom de plume great concealed poets rome 
known facts terence says baconian critic consulted smith biographical dictionary almost unavoidable inference john davies made comparison shakspere knew point common cases 
common point taken men famous comic dramatists roman literary gossips said baconians mr greenwood say terence said mask name shakespeare mask name 
second opinion hint literature time good

thus even actor habitually spelled name shakspere william shakespeare practically baconian theory pseudonym one man poet also real name another man well known actor concealed poet

nay sure would capable collaborating man george wilkins perhaps writing quite well even better 
follow author either venus adonis hamlet

therefore though bookless debarred pursuits literature partnership wilkins

whoever wrote plays actor bacon man moon whoever legally owned manuscripts equally incurious negligent preservation correct text 
shall see later baconians urge without evidence bacon edited gave ben jonson duty editing first collected edition work done indescribably negligent reckless manner mr greenwood repeatedly states edition opinion contains least two plays shakespeare concealed poet masses non shakespearean work 
could happen bacon one hypothesis either revised plays entrusted task strict editor ben jonson imagine 
also one difficulties mr greenwood theory 
thus argue actor author must conscious great powers 
therefore actor author actor wholly neglected collect printed print manuscript works 
argument equally potent authorship plays bacon 
left manuscripts unpublished till 
could avow authorship cry baconians giving various exquisite reasons 
indeed bacon author might care divulge long association cry players man like stratford 
occasion avow 
merely suggest players safe channel collect publish works old friend shakspere 
thus indifferent main author plays whether actor statesman actor least blame chaos first collected edition made grave bacon busy revising superintending latin translations works scientific subjects

neglect characteristic playwrights next generation

arguments orthodox stratfordian apt reply finds plays poems plenty inaccurate general information classical subjects information whole literature england abounded 
also finds plays knowledge certain latin authors proved translated date shakespeare drew 
much latin shakespeare knew opinion presently explained 
reply baconians anti willians must say author plays lore scholars also possessed use knowledge like scholar 
see scholar could make scansion blank verse proves author make second syllable name posthumus cymbeline long 
must read famous line horace thus eheu fugaces posthoome posthoome could scarce scape whipping even stratford free school 
way makes penultimate syllable andronicus short equally impossible 
mr greenwood shall see denies titus andronicus also appears credit one older plays revised improved dressed taken authorship several cases 
scholar would corrected accepted false quantities 
cases greeks trojans cite plato aristotle troilus cressida plato aristotle lived thousand years latest conceivable date siege troy possibly suppose scholar would permitted freak winter tale borrowed earlier novel absurdity calling delphi delphos non existent word confusing delphos delos placing delphian oracle island 
play author quite needlessly makes artist giulio romano contemporary flourishing age oracle pythian apollo 
least would ignorance 
think sufficient testimony ben inability refrain gibes shakspere want scholarship 
rowe traditions davenant tells conversation suckling davenant endymion porter hales eton ben harped want learning hales snubbed

pursuing facts find sturley wrote latin richard quiney shakespeare friend could read sturley letter could read latin 
young richard quiney apparently aged eleven wrote latin father 
young richard quiney son shakespeare friend richard quiney course latin age eleven would prove schoolboy stratford one stratford boy could write latin generation following shakespeare

thus say persian attire

two great poets write fear death cries new born children dissolution recombination nature old age ideas common obvious ideas glorified poetry shakespeare told borrowing lucretius juvenal critic leaves reader find study latin passages quote 
arbitrary taste matters mr collins like mr grant white independently finds shakespeare putting thought alcibiades plato mouth achilles troilus cressida mr j robertson suggests borrowing seneca mr collins find smallest parallel

three pages parallels sophocles therefore follow 
curiously close similarities expression also barred 
four pages examples therefore follow sophocles aeschylus plays fragments euripides homer 
identities sentiment similar circumstances cited two pages cited similarities however striking may metaphorical expression safely used several pages follow 
finally mr collins chooses single play aias sophocles tests shakespeare unluckily part titus andronicus mr greenwood regards usually non shakespearean unknown great author

sorts parallels shakespeare greeks mr collins tells us count proofs shakespeare knew greek tragedians

chapter xii ben jonson shakespeare evidence ben jonson identity shakespeare author shakspere actor strength stratfordian faith says mr greenwood 
think admitted various jonsonian utterances regard shakespeare means easy reconcile one 
difficult reply briefly mr greenwood forty seven pages evidence jonson 
first whenever written words reported conversation ben speaks shakespeare name speaks works drummond hawthornden commendatory verses folio probably posthumously published discourses writes shakespeare friend fellow players shakespeare friend dramatist 
three occasions ben tone varies 
said drummond hawthornden apparently two separate occasions shakespeare lacked art made mistake wreck sea coast bohemia 
ben spoke gruffly briefly shakespeare drummond also spoke disparagingly beaumont panegyrised epigram folio praise commendatory verses folio 
spoke still harshly drayton compared homer virgil theocritus tyraeus told unkind anecdote marston first quarrelled made friends collaborating play generously great peril sharing imprisonment 
drummond jonson merely said beat marston took away pistol 
sir john beaumont brother dramatist ben written hyperbolical eulogy verse luckily sir john drummond ben speak 
ben panegyric verse hyperbolical conversation despiser others praiser 
compare ben three remarks donne made drummond 
donne deserved hanging breaking metre donne would perish understood donne points first living poets 
mr greenwood effort disable jonson evidence rests contradictions estimates shakespeare poetry notices scattered thirty years 
jonson argued occasion mean 
must mean great unknown 
yet proved ben least consistent critics depended occasion humor moment 
commonplace literary history 
baconians know mr greenwood knows ignores bases argument facts may unknown readers 
noted ben words touched panegyric 
thirdly probably ben wrote manuscript book discourses affectionate critical page shakespeare man author 
always prose verse recorded conversation ben explicitly identified shakspere william stratford author plays usually ascribed 
baconian judge webb extreme old age anti shakespearean mr greenwood others choose interpret ben words theory tongue cheek like odysseus mingled things false true know true false undo many knots ben tied tongue 
succeed shall see 
addition three known mentions shakespeare name ben certainly appears satirise rival much earlier date especially pantalabus playwright poetaster actor poet plagiarist epigram poet ape published collected works probably written early 
well known shakespeare company acted ben every man humour 
appears conceived grudge actors apparently shakespeare playwrights poetaster satire playwrights actors calls apes 
apparent attacks shakespeare ben angry envious would direct know poet player period could apply 
example poetaster histrio actor advised ingratiate pantalabus gent man parcel poet father man worship tell thee 
perhaps unmistakably blow shakespeare recently acquired father arms pleasure writing gentleman 
parcel poet gent man pens lofty new stalking style thus author pens high style 
called pantalabus greek words take means poet plagiarist 
jonson repeats charge verses called poet ape takes makes man wit told slights 
scene added poetaster author ben advised sad serious verse wound pantalabus railing saucy jests obviously slighting charges plagiarism 
perhaps ben glancing shakespeare accused plagiary angry rival would merely laugh 
reply poetaster namely satiromastix dekker marston introduces jonson babbling darkly mr justice shallow innocent moor othello 
question administering strong pills jonson lumps hard indigested stuff bitter satirism arrogance self love detraction black stinking insolence fetch pill reply ben purge poets poetaster

stupid old nonsense less obscure indications jonson spite stage quarrel shakespeare unmistakable proof lies verses poet ape

jonson already poetaster using term poet ape calls actors large apes 
jonson thought well rhymes included epigrams first folio 
date year shakespeare death really loved shakespeare says verse prose ben might suppressed verses 
drummond noted preferred jest friend usually understood man apt resent blunt shaft obsolete wit 
like moliere shakespeare outlived charge plagiarism made long ago jealous ben 
poet ape actor playwright would thought chief words could apply shakespeare rival save ben near throne 
playwright actor confessedly grown little wealth credit scene actor playwright could said 
author works jonson laughed calling plays works works frippery wit tissue plagiarisms case pantalabus 
told slights successful authors accused often plagiarism jealous rivals wisely moliere 
poet ape began career picking gleaning buying reversions old plays 
means shakespeare work earlier plays company acquired shakespeare presume bacon much bad humor gist rhymes poet ape 
ben thinks shakespeare works larcenous still works poet actor 
hope clear poet ape like pantalabus takes grown little wealth credit scene thinks chief contemporary dramatists nobody shakespeare 
hence follows works poet ape works shakespeare 
ben admits nay asserts existence works says may reach time calls mass plagiarisms jealous rage 
view suit mr greenwood shows ben regarding shakespeare ape actor also poet author works 
yet ben words mean nothing actor author works ben accuses plagiarism 
mr greenwood thinks epigram proves merely jonson looked upon shakspere indeed refers one put forward writings others plain english impostor 
work goes name truth work somebody else 
mr greenwood put interpretation greene words shakescene showed interpretation impossible 
utmost entitled say shake scene meant shakspere greene accuses player shakspere putting forward work perhaps parts work really indebted another

b way ben words tortured sense work goes poet ape name truth work somebody else 
c mr greenwood tries find anti willian hypothesis greene groatsworth wit ben epigram 
neither 
jonson accusing shakespeare pretending author plays written somebody else making man wit men dramatists day 
thus future may judge shakespeare work well 
living recognized dramatists shakespeare said plagiarise boldly robbed leave rage pity 
ben mean shakespeare publishing whole plays author works tissues scraps stolen contemporaries us robbed 
found heard works player poet would chief dramatist day except signed william shak c 
none thus ben date identifying shakspere actor author shakespearean plays expects reach posterity times may judge times hour 
thus ben expresses accordance humor occasion discrepant opinions works never varies identification author plays 
works ben wrote splenetically poet ape works playwright actor could nobody actor shakespeare far ben knew 
later altered circumstances wrote works different terms utterances easily reconcilable whoever real author works may 
bacon mr greenwood anonymous equivalent bacon author ben came know attitudes towards works still irreconcilable ever

everybody knows many falsehoods justifiable actually duty tell

appendix ii chettle supposed allusion shakspere discussing contemporary allusions william shakspere shakespeare however spell name relied chettle remarks kind hart dreame concerning greene groatsworth wit 
chettle speaks saying letter written divers play makers offensively one two taken 
appears one two chettle means two 
neither take offence acquainted time edited groatsworth one care never 
know gentlemen quondam acquaintance addressed greene 
usually supposed marlowe peele lodge nash 
know two take offence man chettle care acquainted 
according chettle seen demeanor less civil excellent quality professes profession say besides divers worship reported uprightness dealing argues honesty facetious grace writing approves art 
speaking observation chettle avers person speaks civil demeanor apparently excellent quality professes profession 
speaking evidence divers worship man said possess facetious grace writing 
writings published chettle bookish man would read formed opinion 
works lodge peele marlowe published 
writing quality professes profession man chettle refers 
hand profession greene quondam acquaintance writing spend wits making plays 
thus man wrote whose profession writing far appear one addressed greene 
seems undeniable greene addresses gentlemen playmakers spend wits making plays actors greene purpose warn rich ungrateful actors 
greene friends moment wrote one profession actor greene warning actors directed actor intelligible 
mr greenwood writes shown george peele one playwrights addressed greene peele successful player well playwright might quite truly alluded facetious grace writing excellent quality professed professional actor 
confess know george peele oxford ever player successful player 
one may ask george peele profess quality actor professional actor occasional playwright apt believe greene seriously advised put faith members profession 
successful member profession profession greene complains exploited dramatic authors peele stood danger 
thus see chettle professional actor reported facetious grace writing identified peele 
identification seems impossible 
peele marlowe literary gentlemen lodge filibustering though literary man yet become physician 
none three profession literature far aware 
man special profession also wrote one three tom nash mere literary gentleman pamphleteer playwright 
know name one three greene addressed groatsworth though atheistic writer tragedies seems meant disgracefully meant marlowe 
know chettle expressing regrets greene language one applauded exercise profession according divers worship also facetious grace writing 
seen less civil excellent quality professes whether means chettle seen excellence profession tell certain chettle remark least contrasted gives merely report facetious grace writing man question 
writing part profession conceive lodge peele marlowe nash 
mysterious personage malone dyce steevens collier halliwell phillipps knight sir sidney lee messrs gosse garnett mr j c collins say shakspere 
mr fleay mr castle whose mind legal pointed weird shake scene shakspere greene meant shakspere attacked greene 
chettle says groatsworth wit letter written divers play makers offensively one two taken 
mysterious one therefore one playwrights addressed greene 
consequently followers malone wrote messrs fleay castle mistaken mr greenwood say sir sidney lee j c collins dr garnett mr gosse way moral reprobation may read curious pages 
meanwhile take chettle strict grammarian words letter written divers play makers offensively one two taken excluded letter assuredly written 
whose mind legal certain chettle mean letter written divers play makers one two makers plays offensively taken 
opinion seems less improbable person chettle apologetic excels quality profession contrasted identical facetious grace writing parergon bye work case 
whoever person certainly marlowe peele lodge nash 
must look person profession also reported facetious grace writing 
chettle held tight grammar greene referred one unknown one wrote stage another profession 
chettle thus tautly construed confess seems shakspere even mind 
quality professed actor also conceive reported facetious grace writing
