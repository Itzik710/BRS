bayete father chief chiefs lion elephant turned nursed us old overshadowed peoples took charge ended mastering boers single strength help fatherless trouble salutation father bayete sompseu preface writer romance encouraged task purpose somewhat beyond setting wild tale savage life 
yet lad seventeen years ago fortune took south africa 
thrown men thirty forty years intimately acquainted zulu people history heroes customs 
heard many tales traditions perhaps rarely told nowadays time come may cease told altogether 
zulus still nation nation destroyed chief aim white rulers root warlike spirit remarkable replace spirit peaceful progress 
zulu military organization perhaps wonderful world seen already thing past perished ulundi 
chaka invented organization building smallest beginnings 
appeared commencement century ruler single small tribe fell year beneath assegais brothers umhlangana dingaan servant mopo umbopo called also south eastern africa feet march power slaughtered million human beings 
attempt made pages set true character colossal genius evil man napoleon tiberiius one also brother successor dingaan need said 
author aim moreover convey narrative form idea remarkable spirit animated kings subjects make accessible popular shape incidents history part found scarce works reference rarely consulted except students 
obvious task presented difficulties since undertakes must time forget civilisation think mind speak voice zulu old regime 
horrors perpetrated zulu tyrants published polite age melanite torpedoes details therefore suppressed 
still much remains think wrong massacre fighting written except special correspondents sufferings mankind beneath one world cruel tyrannies form groundwork romance may invited leave book unread 
indeed nearly historical incidents recorded substantially true 
thus said chaka actually kill mother unandi reason given destroy entire tribe tatiyana cleft prophesied coming white man receiving death wounds 
incident missionary furnace logs impossible speak certainly 
came writer lips old traveller zulu discover confirmation 
still kings undoubtedly put soldiers many tests equal severity 
umbopo mopo named tale actually lived 
stabbed chaka rose great eminence 
disappears scene accurately known whether also went way assegai perhaps suggested came live near stanger name zweete 
fate two lovers mouth cave true zulu tale considerably varied suit purposes romance 
late mr leslie died tells book among zulus amatongas 
heard story day says power writing fiction possessed might worked first class sensational novel 
story woven plot book 
also writer indebted artifice umslopogaas obtained admission swazi stronghold told mr leslie zulu performed feat thereby wife 
also writer thanks due friends mr f b fynney late zulu border agent much information given bygone years word mouth recently pamphlet zululand zulus mr john bird formerly treasurer government natal whose compilation annals natal invaluable would study early history colony zululand 
wilder romantic incidents story hunting umslopogaas galazi wolves rather hyaenas true wolves zululand author say seem sort might well mythically connected names heroes 
similar beliefs traditions common records primitive peoples 
club watcher fords give zulu name u nothlola mazibuko historical weapon chronicled bishop callaway 
owned certain undhlebekazizwa 
arbitrary person matter discussed village would bring conclusion stick 
made good end zulu soldiers attacked killed less twenty watcher spears stuck thick reeds morass 
man strength great could kill leopard like fly hands much umslopogaas slew traitor story 
perhaps may allowable add words zulu mysticism magic superstition allusion romance 
little exaggerated 
thus writer well remembers hearing legend guardian spirit ama zulu seen riding storm 
mr fynney says pamphlet reference made natives spirit call nomkubulwana inkosazana ye zulu princess heaven 
said robed white take form young maiden fact angel 
said appear chosen person imparts revelation whatever revelation may kept profound secret outsiders 
remember zulu war nomkubulwana appeared revealing something great effect throughout land know zulus quite impressed calamity befall 
one ominous signs fire said descended heaven ignited grass graves former kings zululand 
another occasion nomkubulwana appeared one zululand result visit native women buried young children heads sand deserting time going away weeping returning nightfall unearth little ones 
divine personage therefore authority may said supernatural matters spoken pages 
exact spiritual position held zulu mind umkulunkulu old old great great lord heavens vexed question proper consideration reader must referred bishop callaway work religious system amazulu 
briefly umkulunkulu character seems vary idea ancestral spirit spirit ancestor god 
case able highly intelligent person like mopo story ideal would probably low one therefore made speak umkulunkulu great spirit god 
remains writer express regret story varied hue

dingaan heard message grew mad lion net desired maid everything yet things could win maid 
command great impi gathered sent swaziland halakazi tribe destroy seize maid 
matter came discussed indunas presence king amapakati council chief indunas spoke saying tribe halakazi great strong war would mean war swazis also moreover dwelling caves win 
also said time send impis seek single girl years gone since black one fell foes many soldiers land waxed slaughter half perished marshes limpopo 
time must given grow day little child like man wasted hunger

thus spoke boldly face king none dared speak chaka courage passed hearts indunas generals echoed words knew follies begin new war swazi people would greatest 
dingaan listened brow grew dark yet firmly seated throne dared put away words still many land loved memory chaka remembered dingaan murdered umhlangana also 
chaka dead people forgot evilly dealt remembered great man made zulu people nothing smith fashions bright spear lump iron 
also though changed masters yet burden lessened chaka slew dingaan slew also chaka oppressed dingaan oppress 
therefore dingaan yielded voice indunas impi sent halakazi seek maid named lily 
still hankered heart hour hated crossed robbed desire 
father told though know maid named lily daughter nada

chapter xxiv 
slaying boers morrow led umslopogaas apart spoke thus son yesterday know except mouth dingaan charged certain message dingaan king delivered ears king surely brought death upon people 
tree stands plain umslopogaas thinks tall shade equal shade 
yet bigger trees 
solitary tree umslopogaas topmost branches serve thicker trunk beneath shadow live many woodcutters go lop would grow high 
match dingaan though dwelling alone empty land grown great eyes eyes 
moreover umslopogaas know dingaan already hates words bygone years sent masilo fool black one dead heard words eat

indeed blood chaka veins could otherwise plan father asked 
say brought thus umslopogaas 
among tribe halakazi swaziland dwells maid named lily
