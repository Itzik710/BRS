first men moon hg wells chapter mr bedford meets mr cavor lympne sit write amidst shadows vine leaves blue sky southern italy comes certain quality astonishment participation amazing adventures mr cavor outcome purest accident 
might one 
fell things time thought removed slightest possibility disturbing experiences 
gone lympne imagined uneventful place world 
rate said shall find peace chance work book sequel 
utterly variance destiny little plans men 
may perhaps mention recently come ugly cropper certain business enterprises 
sitting surrounded circumstances wealth luxury admitting extremity 
admit even certain extent disasters conceivably making 
may directions capacity conduct business operations among 
days young youth among objectionable forms took pride capacity affairs 
young still years things happened rubbed something youth mind 
whether brought wisdom light doubtful matter 
scarcely necessary go details speculations landed lympne kent 
nowadays even business transactions strong spice adventure 
took risks 
things invariably certain amount give take fell finally giving reluctantly enough 
even got everything one cantankerous creditor saw fit malignant 
perhaps met flaming sense outraged virtue perhaps felt 
ran hard 
seemed last nothing write play unless wanted drudge living clerk 
certain imagination luxurious tastes meant make vigorous fight fate overtook 
addition belief powers business man always days idea equal writing good play 
believe uncommon persuasion 
knew nothing man outside legitimate business transactions opulent possibilities probably biased opinion 
indeed got habit regarding unwritten drama convenient little reserve put rainy day 
rainy day come set work 
soon discovered writing play longer business supposed first reckoned ten days pied terre hand came lympne 
reckoned lucky getting little bungalow 
got three years agreement 
put sticks furniture play hand cooking 
cooking would shocked mrs bond 
yet know flavor 
coffee pot sauce pan eggs one potatoes frying pan sausages bacon simple apparatus comfort 
one always magnificent simplicity always possible alternative 
rest laid eighteen gallon cask beer credit trustful baker came day 
perhaps style sybaris worse times 
little sorry baker decent man indeed even hoped 
certainly one wants solitude place lympne 
clay part kent bungalow stood edge old sea cliff stared across flats romney marsh sea 
wet weather place almost inaccessible heard times postman used traverse succulent portions route boards upon feet 
never saw quite imagine 
outside doors cottages houses make present village big birch besoms stuck wipe worst clay give idea texture district 
doubt place would fading memory things gone ever 
big port england roman times portus lemanis sea four miles away 
steep hill boulders masses roman brickwork old watling street still paved places starts like arrow north 
used stand hill think galleys legions captives officials women traders speculators like swarm tumult came clanking harbor 
lumps rubble grassy slope sheep two port levels marsh sweeping round broad curve distant dungeness dotted tree clumps church towers old medical towns following lemanis towards extinction 
outlook marsh indeed one finest views ever seen 
suppose dungeness fifteen miles away lay like raft sea farther westward hills hastings setting sun 
sometimes hung close clear sometimes faded low often drift weather took clean sight 
nearer parts marsh laced lit ditches canals 
window worked looked skyline crest window first set eyes cavor 
struggling scenario holding mind sheer hard work naturally enough arrested attention 
sun set sky vivid tranquillity green yellow came black oddest little figure 
short round bodied thin legged little man jerky quality motions seen fit clothe extraordinary mind cricket cap overcoat cycling knickerbockers stockings 
know never cycled never played cricket 
fortuitous concurrence garments arising know 
gesticulated hands arms jerked head buzzed 
buzzed like something electric 
never heard buzzing 
ever cleared throat extraordinary noise 
rain spasmodic walk enhanced extreme slipperiness footpath 
exactly came sun stopped pulled watch hesitated 
sort convulsive gesture turned retreated every manifestation haste longer gesticulating going ample strides showed relatively large size feet remember grotesquely exaggerated size adhesive clay best possible advantage 
occurred first day sojourn play writing energy height regarded incident simply annoying distraction waste five minutes 
returned scenario 
next evening apparition repeated remarkable precision next evening indeed every evening rain falling concentration upon scenario became considerable effort 
confound man said one would think learning marionette several evenings cursed pretty heartily 
annoyance gave way amazement curiosity 
earth man thing fourteenth evening could stand longer soon appeared opened french window crossed verandah directed point invariably stopped 
watch came 
chubby rubicund face reddish brown eyes previously seen light 
one moment sir said turned 
stared 
one moment said certainly 
wish speak longer asking much moment would trouble accompany least said placing beside 
habits regular 
time intercourse limited 
presume time exercise 
come enjoy sunset 
sir never look 
never look 
watched thirteen nights looked sunset 
knitted brows like one encounters problem 
well enjoy sunlight atmosphere go along path gate jerked head shoulder round never 
nonsense 
way 
night instance oh night let see 
ah glanced watch saw already three minutes precise half hour decided time go round turned always 
looked reflected 
perhaps come think 
wanted speak yes 
every night come making noise making noise like 
imitated buzzing noise 
looked evident buzzing awakened distaste 
asked 
every blessed evening 
idea 
stopped dead 
regarded gravely 
said formed habit well looks like 
pulled lower lip finger thumb 
regarded puddle feet 
mind much occupied said 
want know well sir assure know things even know 
come think say never beyond field things annoy reason beginning relent towards 
annoy said 
imagine writing play well anything needs concentration 
ah said course meditated 
expression became eloquent distress relented still 
touch aggression demanding man know hums public footpath 
see said weakly habit 
oh recognize 
must stop 
puts 
business something liberty 
sir said 
greatly indebted 
guard things 
future 
could trouble noise something like said 
zuzzoo zuzzoo 
really know greatly obliged 
fact know getting absurdly absent minded 
quite justified sir perfectly justified 
indeed indebted 
thing shall end 
sir already brought farther done 
hope impertinence sir 
regarded moment 
raised hat wished good evening 
responded convulsively went ways 
stile looked back receding figure 
bearing changed remarkably seemed limp shrunken 
contrast former gesticulating zuzzoing self took absurd way pathetic 
watched sight 
wishing heartily kept business returned bungalow play 
next evening saw nothing next 
much mind occurred sentimental comic character might serve useful purpose development plot 
third day called upon 
time puzzled think brought 
made indifferent conversation formal way abruptly came business 
wanted buy bungalow 
see said blame least destroyed habit disorganises day 
walked past years years 
doubt hummed made impossible suggested might try direction 

direction 
one 
inquired 
every afternoon four come dead wall 
dear sir thing important vital 
see investigator engaged scientific research 
live paused seemed think 
said pointed suddenly dangerously near eye 
house white chimneys see trees 
circumstances abnormal abnormal 
point completing one important demonstrations assure one important demonstrations ever made 
requires constant thought constant mental ease activity 
afternoon brightest time effervescing new ideas new points view 
come still would different 
self conscious 
think play watching irritated instead thinking work 
must bungalow 
meditated 
naturally wanted think matter thoroughly anything decisive said 
generally ready enough business days selling always attracted first place bungalow even sold good price might get inconvenienced delivery goods current owner got wind transaction second well undischarged 
clearly business required delicate handling 
moreover possibility pursuit valuable invention also interested 
occurred would like know research dishonest intention simply idea know would relief play writing 
threw feelers 
quite willing supply information 
indeed fairly way conversation became monologue 
talked like man long pent 
talked nearly hour must confess found pretty stiff bit listening 
undertone satisfaction one feels one neglecting work one set oneself 
first interview gathered little drift work 
half words technicalities entirely strange illustrated one two points pleased call elementary mathematics computing envelope copying ink pencil manner made hard even seem understand 
yes said yes 
go nevertheless made enough convince mere crank playing discoveries 
spite crank like appearance force made impossible 
whatever thing mechanical possibilities 
told work shed three assistants originally jobbing carpenters trained 
work shed patent office clearly one step 
invited see things 
accepted readily took care remark underline 
proposed transfer bungalow remained conveniently suspense 
last rose depart apology length call 
talking work said pleasure enjoyed rarely 
often found intelligent listener mingled little professional scientific men 
much pettiness explained much intrigue really one idea novel fertilising idea want uncharitable man believes impulses 
made perhaps rash proposition 
must remember alone play writing lympne fourteen days compunction ruined walk still hung 
said make new habit place one spoilt least settle bungalow 
want turn work mind 
always done afternoon walk 
unfortunately get things back 
come talk work use sort wall may throw thoughts catch certain know enough steal ideas know scientific men stopped 
considering 
evidently thing attracted 
afraid bore said 
think dull oh technicalities anyhow interested immensely afternoon 
course would great help 
nothing clears one ideas much explaining 
hitherto dear sir say 
really spare time rest like change occupation said profound conviction 
affair 
verandah steps turned 
already greatly indebted said 
made interrogative noise 
completely cured ridiculous habit humming explained 
think said glad service turned away 
immediately train thought conversation suggested must resumed sway 
arms began wave former fashion 
faint echo zuzzoo came back breeze well affair came next day next day delivered two lectures physics mutual satisfaction 
talked air extremely lucid ether tubes force gravitational potential things like sat folding chair said yes go follow keep going 
tremendously difficult stuff think ever suspected much understand 
moments doubted whether well employed rate resting confounded play 
things gleamed clearly space vanish thought hold 
sometimes attention failed altogether would give sit stare wondering whether would better use central figure good farce let stuff slide 
perhaps would catch bit 
earliest opportunity went see house 
large carelessly furnished servants three assistants dietary private life characterised philosophical simplicity 
water drinker vegetarian logical disciplinary things 
sight equipment settled many doubts 
looked like business cellar attic amazing little place find way village 
ground floor rooms contained benches apparatus bakehouse scullery boiler developed respectable furnaces dynamos occupied cellar gasometer garden 
showed confiding zest man living much alone 
seclusion overflowing excess confidence good luck recipient 
three assistants creditable specimens class handy men came 
conscientious unintelligent strong civil willing 
one spargus cooking metal work sailor second gibbs joiner third ex jobbing gardener general assistant 
merest labourers 
intelligent work done cavor 
darkest ignorance compared even muddled impression 
nature inquiries 
unhappily comes grave difficulty 
scientific expert attempt set forth highly scientific language mr cavor aim experiments tended afraid confuse reader almost certainly make blunder would bring upon mockery every date student mathematical physics country 
best thing therefore think give impressions inexact language without attempt wear garment knowledge claim 
object mr cavor search substance opaque used word forgotten opaque conveys idea forms radiant energy 
radiant energy made understand anything like light heat rontgen rays much talk year ago electric waves marconi gravitation 
things said radiate centres act bodies distance whence comes term radiant energy 
almost substances opaque form radiant energy 
glass example transparent light much less heat useful fire screen alum transparent light blocks heat completely 
solution iodine carbon bisulphide hand completely blocks light quite transparent heat 
hide fire permit warmth reach 
metals opaque light heat also electrical energy passes iodine solution glass almost though interposed 

known substances transparent gravitation 
use screens various sorts cut light heat electrical influence sun warmth earth anything screen things sheets metal marconi rays nothing cut gravitational attraction sun gravitational attraction earth 
yet nothing hard say 
cavor see substance exist certainly could tell 
never thought possibility 
showed calculations paper lord kelvin doubt professor lodge professor karl pearson great scientific people might understood simply reduced hopeless muddle substance possible must satisfy certain conditions 
amazing piece reasoning 
much amazed exercised time would impossible reproduce 
yes said yes go suffice story believed might able manufacture possible substance opaque gravitation complicated alloy metals something new new element fancy called believe helium sent london sealed stone jars 
doubt thrown upon detail almost certain helium sent sealed stone jars 
certainly something gaseous thin 
taken notes foresee necessity taking notes one merest germ imagination understand extraordinary possibilities substance sympathise little emotion felt understanding emerged haze abstruse phrases cavor expressed 
comic relief play indeed time would believe interpreted aright careful ask questions would enabled gauge profundity misunderstanding dropped daily exposition 
one reading story sympathise fully barren narrative impossible gather strength conviction astonishing substance positively going made 
recall gave play hour consecutive work time visit house 
imagination things 
seemed limit possibilities stuff whichever way tried came miracles revolutions 
example one wanted lift weight however enormous one get sheet substance beneath one might lift straw 
first natural impulse apply principle guns ironclads material methods war shipping locomotion building every conceivable form human industry 
chance brought birth chamber new time epoch less one chances come thousand years 
thing unrolled expanded expanded 
among things saw redemption business man 
saw parent company daughter companies applications right us applications left rings trusts privileges concessions spreading spreading one vast stupendous cavorite company ran ruled world 
took line straight away 
knew staking everything jumped 
absolutely biggest thing ever invented said put accent 
want keep gun 
coming fourth labourer morrow 
seemed surprised enthusiasm bit suspicious hostile 
rather self depreciatory 
looked doubtfully 
really think said 
play play vanished cried 
dear sir see got see going merely rhetorical turn positively first could believe 
beginning inkling idea 
astonishing little man working purely theoretical grounds whole time said important research world ever seen simply meant squared many theories settled much doubt troubled application stuff going turn machine makes guns 
possible substance going make v la tout frenchman says 
beyond childish made would go posterity cavorite cavorine would made frs portrait given away scientific worthy nature things like 
saw would dropped bombshell world though discovered new species gnat happened come along 
would lain fizzled like one two little things scientific people lit dropped us 
realized talking cavor said go jumped 
paced room gesticulating like boy twenty 
tried make understand duties responsibilities matter duties responsibilities matter 
assured might make wealth enough work sort social revolution fancied might order whole world 
told companies patents case secret processes 
things seemed take much mathematics taken 
look perplexity came ruddy little face 
stammered something indifference wealth brushed aside 
got rich good stammering 
gave understand sort man considerable business experience 
tell undischarged bankrupt time temporary think reconciled evident poverty financial claims 
quite insensibly way projects grow understanding cavorite monopoly grew us 
make stuff make boom 
stuck like leech exist 
idea profits spoke might go endow research course matter settle later 
right shouted right 
great point insisted get thing done 
substance cried home factory fortress ship dare without universally applicable even patent medicine 
solitary aspect one ten thousand possible uses make us rich cavor beyond dreams avarice said 
begin see 
extraordinary one gets new points view talking things happens talked right man suppose one said absolutely averse enormous wealth 
course one thing paused 
stood still 
possible know may able make may one things theoretical possibility practical absurdity 
make may little hitch tackle hitch comes 
said chapter first making cavorite cavor fears groundless far actual making concerned 
th october incredible substance made oddly enough made last accident mr cavor least expected 
fused together number metals certain things wish knew particulars intended leave mixture week allow cool slowly 
unless miscalculated last stage combination would occur stuff sank temperature degrees fahrenheit 
chanced unknown cavor dissension arisen furnace tending 
gibbs previously seen suddenly attempted shift man gardener score coal soil dug therefore could possibly fall within province joiner man jobbing gardener alleged however coal metallic ore like substance let alone cook 
spargus insisted gibbs coaling seeing joiner coal notoriously fossil wood 
consequently gibbs ceased replenish furnace one else cavor much immersed certain interesting problems concerning cavorite flying machine neglecting resistance air one two points perceive anything wrong 
premature birth invention took place coming across field bungalow afternoon talk tea 
remember occasion extreme vividness 
water boiling everything prepared sound zuzzoo brought upon verandah 
active little figure black autumnal sunset right chimneys house rose gloriously tinted group trees 
remoter rose wealden hills faint blue left hazy marsh spread spacious serene 
chimneys jerked heavenward smashing string bricks rose roof miscellany furniture followed 
overtaking came huge white flame 
trees building swayed whirled tore pieces sprang towards flare 
ears smitten clap thunder left deaf one side life windows smashed unheeded 
took three steps verandah towards cavor house even came wind 
instantly coat tails head progressing great leaps bounds quite towards 
moment discoverer seized whirled flew screaming air 
saw one chimney pots hit ground within six yards leap score feet hurry great strides towards focus disturbance 
cavor kicking flapping came rolled ground space struggled lifted borne forward enormous velocity vanishing last among laboring lashing trees writhed house 
mass smoke ashes square bluish shining substance rushed towards zenith 
large fragment fencing came sailing past dropped edgeways hit ground fell flat worst 
aerial commotion fell swiftly mere strong gale became aware breath feet 
leaning back wind managed stop could collect wits still remained 
instant whole face world changed 
tranquil sunset vanished sky dark scurrying clouds everything flattened swaying gale 
glanced back see bungalow still general way standing staggered forwards towards trees amongst cavor vanished whose tall leaf denuded branches shone flames burning house 
entered copse dashing one tree another clinging space sought vain 
amidst heap smashed branches fencing banked portion garden wall perceived something stir 
made run reached brown object separated rose two muddy legs protruded two drooping bleeding hands 
tattered ends garment fluttered middle portion streamed wind
