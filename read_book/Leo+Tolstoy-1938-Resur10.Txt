nekhludoff would liked tell jurymen relations yesterday prisoner 
rights thought ought got yesterday trial disclosed guilt 
entered court jurymen witnessed procedure day 
judges coming proclaimed three men embroidered collars ascended platform settling jury high backed chairs gendarmes portraits priest nekhludoff felt though knew ought could interrupt solemnity 
preparations trials day excepting swearing jury president address omitted 
case court day one burglary 
prisoner guarded two gendarmes naked swords thin narrow chested lad bloodless sallow face dressed gray cloak 
sat alone prisoner dock 
boy accused together companion broken lock shed stolen several old mats valued roubles rouble worth little two shillings contains copecks copecks 
according indictment policeman stopped boy passing companion carrying mats shoulder 
boy companion confessed imprisoned 
boy companion locksmith died prison boy tried alone 
old mats lying table objects material evidence 
business conducted manner day whole armoury evidence proofs witnesses swearing questions experts cross examinations 
answer every question put president prosecutor advocate policeman one witnesses variably ejected words tell 
yet spite stupefied rendered mere machine military discipline reluctance speak arrest prisoner evident 
another witness old house proprietor owner mats evidently rich old man asked whether mats reluctantly identified 
public prosecutor asked meant mats use got angry answered devil take mats want 
known would bother gone looking would rather added ten rouble note two dragged pestered questions 
spent lot isvostchiks 
besides well 
suffering rheumatism last seven years 
thus witness spoke 
accused confessed everything looking round stupidly like animal caught related happened 
still public prosecutor drawing shoulders done day asked subtle questions calculated catch cunning criminal 
speech proved theft committed dwelling place lock broken boy therefore deserved heavy punishment 
advocate appointed court proved theft committed dwelling place though crime serious one prisoner dangerous society prosecutor stated 
president assumed role absolute neutrality way done previous day impressed jury facts knew could help knowing 
came interval day smoked usher called judges coming way two gendarmes sat trying keep awake threatening prisoner naked weapons

traktir cheap restaurant met another like lost place prisoner locksmith trade drunkard 
one night two drunk broke lock shed took first thing happened lay hands 
confessed put prison locksmith died awaiting trial 
boy tried dangerous creature society must protected 
dangerous creature yesterday culprit thought nekhludoff listening going 
dangerous judge rake adulterer deceiver 
dangerous 
even supposing boy dangerous court done common sense point view caught clear exceptional evil doer ordinary boy every one sees become simply got circumstances create characters therefore prevent boy going wrong circumstances create unfortunate beings must done away 
seize one lad happens get caught knowing well thousands like caught send prison idleness unwholesome useless labor forced company others weakened ensnared lives led 
send public expense moscow irkoutsk government company depraved men

educate way one millions people catch one imagine done something guarded nothing expected us 
sent moscow irkoutsk government thus thought nekhludoff unusual clearness vividness sitting high backed chair next colonel listening different intonations advocates prosecutor president voices looking self confident gestures 
much hard effort pretence requires continued nekhludoff mind glancing round enormous room portraits lamps armchairs uniforms thick walls large windows picturing tremendous size building still ponderous dimensions whole organization army officials scribes watchmen messengers place russia receive wages carrying comedy one needs 
supposing spent one hundredth efforts helping castaways regard hands bodies required us peace comfort 
one chanced take pity given help time poverty made send town might sufficient nekhludoff thought looking boy piteous face 
even later hours work factory going public house led away companions one come said go vania right would gone got bad ways would done wrong

priest dressed strange inconvenient garb made gold cloth cut arranged little bits bread saucer put cup wine repeating time different names prayers 
meanwhile deacon first read slavonic prayers difficult understand rendered still incomprehensible read fast sang turn turn convicts

besides several verses acts apostles read deacon peculiarly strained voice made impossible understand read priest read distinctly part gospel according st mark said christ risen dead flying heaven sit father right hand first showed mary magdalene driven seven devils eleven disciples ordered preach gospel whole creation priest added one believe would perish believed baptised saved besides drive devils cure people laying hands talk strange tongues take serpents drank poison die remain well 
essence service consisted supposition bits cut priest put wine manipulated prayed certain way turned flesh blood god 
manipulations consisted priest regularly lifting holding arms though hampered gold cloth sack sinking knees kissing table chiefly taking cloth two corners waving regularly softly silver saucer golden cup 
supposed point bread wine turned flesh blood therefore part service performed greatest solemnity 
blessed pure holy mother god priest cried golden partition divided part church rest choir began solemnly sing right glorify virgin mary borne christ without losing virginity therefore worthy greater honor kind cherubim greater glory kind seraphim 
transformation considered accomplished priest taken napkin saucer cut middle bit bread four put wine mouth 
supposed eaten bit god flesh swallowed little blood 
priest drew curtain opened middle door partition taking gold cup hands came door inviting wished also come eat god flesh blood contained cup

chapter xl 
husks religion 
none present inspector maslova seemed conscious fact jesus whose name priest repeated great number times praised curious expressions forbidden things done prohibited meaningless much speaking blasphemous incantation bread wine also clearest words forbidden men call men master pray temples ordered every one pray solitude forbidden erect temples saying come destroy one worship temple spirit truth forbidden judge imprison torment execute men done prohibited kind violence saying come give freedom captives 
one present seemed conscious going greatest blasphemy supreme mockery christ whose name done 
one seemed realize gilt cross enamel medallions ends priest held people kissed nothing emblem gallows christ executed denouncing going 
priests imagined eating drinking body blood christ form bread wine reality eat drink flesh blood wine bits bread ensnaring little ones identified depriving greatest blessings submitting cruel torments hiding men tidings great joy brought 
thought enter mind one present 
priest part quiet conscience brought childhood consider true faith faith held holy men olden times still held church demanded state authorities 
believe bread turned flesh useful soul repeat many words actually swallowed bit god 
one could believe believed one ought hold faith 
strengthened faith fact fulfilling demands faith last years able draw income enabled keep family send son gymnasium daughter school daughters clergy 
deacon believed manner even firmly priest forgotten substance dogmas faith knew prayers dead masses without acathistus definite price real christians readily paid therefore called mercy mercy willingly read said appointed quiet certainty necessary men sell faggots flour potatoes 
prison inspector warders though never understood gone meaning dogmas went church believed must believe higher authorities tsar believed 
besides though faintly unable explain felt faith defended cruel occupations 
faith exist would difficult perhaps impossible use powers torment people quiet conscience 
inspector kind hearted man could lived living unsupported faith 
therefore stood motionless bowed crossed zealously tried feel touched song cherubims sung children received communion lifted one held priest hands 
great majority prisoners believed lay mystic power gilt images vestments candles cups crosses repetition incomprehensible words jesu sweetest mercy power might obtained much convenience future life 
clearly saw deception practiced people adhered faith laughed hearts majority made several attempts get conveniences desired means prayers masses candles got prayers remaining unanswered convinced want success accidental organization approved educated archbishops important necessary rate next life 
maslova also believed way 
felt like rest mixed sensation piety dulness 
stood first crowd behind railing could see one companions receive communion moved theodosia stepped front saw inspector behind standing among warders little peasant light beard fair hair 
theodosia husband gazing fixed eyes wife 
acathistus maslova occupied scrutinising talking theodosia whispers bowed made sign cross every one else

first interview nekhludoff thought saw knew intention serve katusha would pleased touched would katusha horror found katusha existed maslova place 
astonished horrified 
astonished katusha ashamed position position prisoner ashamed position prostitute 
seemed satisfied even proud 
yet could otherwise everybody order able act consider occupation important good 
therefore whatever position person certain form view life men general make occupation seem important good 
usually imagined thief murderer spy prostitute acknowledging profession evil ashamed 
contrary true 
people fate sin mistakes placed certain position however false position may form view life general makes position seem good admissible 
order keep view life people instinctively keep circle people share views life place 
surprises us persons concerned thieves bragging dexterity prostitutes vaunting depravity murderers boasting cruelty

end book book ii 
chapter property land 
possible maslova case come senate fortnight time nekhludoff meant go petersburg need appeal emperor advocate drawn petition advised appeal disregarded according advocate best prepared since causes appeal slight 
party convicts among maslova would likely leave beginning june 
order able follow siberia nekhludoff firmly resolved obliged visit estates settle matters 
nekhludoff first went nearest kousminski large estate lay black earth district derived greatest part income 
lived estate childhood youth twice since mother request taken german steward verified accounts 
state things peasants relations management ie landlord therefore long known 
relations peasants administration utter dependence management 
nekhludoff knew still university student confessed preached henry georgeism basis teaching given land inherited father peasants 
true entering army got habit spending roubles year former occupations ceased regarded duty forgotten left asking money mother allowed came even avoided thinking 
mother death coming property necessity managing raised question position reference private property land 
month nekhludoff would answered strength alter existing order things administering estate would one way another eased conscience continuing live far estates money sent 
decided could leave things go would alter way unprofitable even though complicated difficult relations prison world made money necessary well probable journey siberia 
therefore decided farm land let peasants low rent enable cultivate without depending landlord 
comparing position landowner owner serfs nekhludoff compared renting land peasants instead cultivating hired labor old system serf proprietors used exact money payment serfs place labor 
solution problem yet step towards solution movement towards less rude form slavery 
way meant act 
nekhludoff reached kousminski noon 
trying simplify life every way telegraph hired cart pair station 
driver young fellow nankeen coat belt long waist 
glad talk gentleman especially talking broken winded white horse emaciated spavined one could go foot pace always liked 
driver spoke steward kousminski without knowing driving master 
nekhludoff purposely told 
ostentatious german said driver town read novels sat sideways box passing hand top bottom long whip trying show accomplishments ostentatious german procured three light bays drives lady oh christmas christmas tree big house 
drove visitors 
lectric lights could see like whole government 
cribbed heap money 
heard say bought estate 
nekhludoff imagined quite indifferent way steward managed estate advantages steward derived 
words long waisted driver however pleasant hear 
dark cloud covered sun larks soaring fields winter corn forests already covered fresh young green meadows speckled grazing cattle horses 
fields ploughed nekhludoff enjoyed lovely day 
every unpleasant feeling asked caused remembered driver told way german managing kousminski 
got estate set work unpleasant feeling vanished 
looking books office talk foreman naively pointed advantages derived facts peasants little land lay midst landlord fields made nekhludoff ever determined leave farming let land peasants 
office books talk foreman nekhludoff found two thirds best cultivated land still tilled improved machinery labourers receiving fixed wages third tilled peasants rate five roubles per desiatin two three quarter acres 
peasants plough desiatin three times harrow three times sow mow corn make sheaves deliver threshing ground five roubles amount work done wage labor came least roubles 
everything peasants got office paid labor high price 
paid labor use meadows wood potato stalks nearly debt office 
thus land lay beyond cultivated fields peasants hired four times price value would bring invested five per cent taken peasants 
nekhludoff known saw new light wondered others position could help seeing abnormal conditions 
steward arguments land let peasants agricultural implements would fetch next nothing would impossible get even quarter value peasants would spoil land great loser nekhludoff would strengthened nekhludoff opinion good action letting land peasants thus depriving large part income 
decided settle business 
reaping selling corn left steward manage due season also selling agricultural implements useless buildings 
asked steward call peasants three neighbouring villages lay midst estate kousminski meeting would tell intentions arrange price rent land 
pleasant sense firmness shown face steward arguments readiness make sacrifice nekhludoff left office thinking business strolled round house neglected flower garden year flowers planted front steward house tennis ground overgrown dandelions along lime tree walk used smoke cigar flirted pretty kirimova mother visitor

old fashioned inlaid mahogany arm chair stood corner room chair nekhludoff remembered standing mother bedroom suddenly raised perfectly unexpected sensation soul 
suddenly filled regret thought house would tumble ruin garden would run wild forest would cut farmyards stables sheds machines horses cows knew cost much effort though acquire keep 
seemed easy give hard give even let land lose half income 
consideration proved unreasonable let land peasants thus destroy property came service 
must hold property land 
possess property land keep house farm 
besides going siberia shall need either house estate said one voice 
said another voice going spend life siberia 
may marry children must hand estate good condition received 
duty land 
give destroy everything easy acquire difficult 
must consider future life must dispose property accordingly 
really firm resolve really acting according conscience acting order admired men nekhludoff asked acknowledge influenced thought people would say 
thought questions arose unsolvable seemed 
hopes ridding thoughts falling asleep solving morning head would fresh lay clean bed 
long could sleep 
together fresh air moonlight croaking frogs entered room mingling trills couple nightingales park one close window bush lilacs bloom 
listening nightingales frogs nekhludoff remembered inspector daughter music inspector reminded maslova lips trembled like croaking frogs said must leave
