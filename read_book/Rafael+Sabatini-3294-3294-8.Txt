thought lionel changed mood little 
easily could shattered accusation easily brought proud knees imploring pardon word could done yet feared lest word must jeopardize brother 
calm still watches night lay sleepless upon bed saw things without heat crept change mental attitude 
reviewed evidence led conclusions forced confess measure justified 
wronged wronged yet 
years listened poisonous things said enemies arrogance made 
disregarded loved relations brother become strained account yet returned crush repentance played part cruel belief hand peter godolphin fallen 
must almost seem sense party murder headstrong course kept loving man brother hated 
saw merciful judging 
human felt saw must feel since reactions measured mental exaltations spring natural must hate fiercely loved wellnigh fiercely 
heavy cross bear

sir oliver remonstrated terms put heart anew 
moreover news day allay terrors justices truro informed event accusation made refused point blank take action matter 
reason one master anthony baine witnessed affront offered sir oliver 
declared whatever happened master godolphin consequence deserved brought upon gave decision conscience man honor would permit issue warrant constable 
sir oliver received news witness parson suffered rudeness godolphin hands man gospel peace though entirely supported justice decision declared 
sir oliver thanked protesting kind master baine take view rest avowing hand affair however much appearances might point 
however came knowledge two days later whole countryside ferment master baine consequence attitude taken sir oliver summoned parson straightway rode justice house truro afford certain evidence withheld rosamund sir john killigrew 
master baine said three closeted gentleman library heard gallant pronouncement made come thank express admiration courage 
master baine bowed gravely 
man nature made grave 
since would evil consequences might attend action come lay proof acted rightly even think slayer 
ejaculated master baine amazement 
oh assure use subterfuge shall judge 
proof show say come time might render impossible 
desire made public yet master baine wish draw document would satisfy courts future time matter taken well may 
shrewd plea 
proof upon upon lionel time would efface anon publication made show would late look elsewhere 
assure sir oliver killed happened could hold guilty done punish boorish arrogant offender 
know sir 

one pieces evidence indeed chief item godolphin body door trail blood 
two grew tensely interested 
parson watched unblinking eyes 
follows logically think inevitably indeed murderer must wounded encounter 
blood could possibly victim therefore must slayer slayer wounded indeed know since blood upon godolphin sword 
master baine sir andrew shall witnesses upon body much scratch recent date 
strip naked first mischance stray world shall satisfy 
thereafter shall beg master baine indite document mentioned 
removed doublet spoke 
since give louts accuse much satisfaction lest seem go fear must beg sirs keep matter entirely private time publication may rendered necessary events

chapter vi

thought asking brother bluntly key precise meaning disconcerting statement courage failed 
feared lest sir oliver confirm dread interpretation 
drew away time soon went bed 
days thereafter phrase rankled mind throw burden 
conviction grew upon sir oliver meant enheartened knowledge speaking choose could clear 
sir oliver would speak could think 
indeed entirely assured sir oliver far intending throw burden 
yet might come change mind 
burden might grow heavy longings rosamund clamorous grief eyes brother murderer overwhelming 
lionel soul shuddered contemplate consequences 
fears self revelatory 
realized far sincere proposal tell truth perceived emotional outburst moment proposal accepted must bitterly repented 
came reflection guilty emotional outbursts could outrageously play traitor real desires men subject might brother come fall prey one moments mental storm climax despair would find burden altogether overwhelming rebellion cast lionel sought assure brother man stern fibers man never lost control 
would argue happened past guarantee might happen future limit set endurance every man never strong far impossible limit sir oliver endurance might reached affair 
happened case find answer picture beyond fortitude contemplate 
danger sent trial made suffer extreme penalty law would far greater spoken 
tale could told must compelled attention accounted man unsmirched honor word must carry weight 
none would believe 
would argue silence suffered brother unjustly accused craven hearted dishonourable acted thus good defense offer deed 
would irrevocably doomed would doomed ignominy would scorned upright men become thing contempt whose end tear would shed 
thus came dread conclusion endeavors screen enmeshed inextricably

pale looks hollow eyes contributed opinion brother sin weighing heavily upon 
ever known gentle kindly lad things opposite turbulent sir oliver assumed sir oliver present increasing harshness used brother ill lad would condone crime

one day early march master jasper leigh tale another kind news dispelled lionel mind interest captain ventures spanish main 
seaman followed departing lionel door little inn stood stirrup got horse

tell truth said small quavering voice 
sir oliver turned considered attentively 
god name lal thy mind asked almost roughly

explanation brought lionel relief 
relief ephemeral 
reflection presented new fear 
came sir oliver cleared necessity implication must follow 
terrors swiftly magnified risk slender entirely negligible 
eyes ceased risk became certain inevitable danger 
sir oliver put forward proof trail blood proceeded must thought lionel inevitably concluded 
well might sir oliver tell whole truth surely could fail infer 
thus reasoned terror accounting lost irrevocably 
gone fears brother able abate sufficiently allow reason prevail must brought understand much carried justified probability 
oliver would shown would told collapsing charge fresh charge could levelled scrap suspicion ever attached lionel ever could 
lionel dared seek brother matter
