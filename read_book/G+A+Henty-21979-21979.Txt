first day two struck boys dangerous leave canoe high sand would observed even distance passing prahu 
consequently deep trench dug sea far enough allow canoe floating lie level beach 
leaving day roughly covered seaweed might therefore escape observation craft passing short distance shore 
expeditions along reef boys discovered passage 
double width ship amply sufficient depth allow vessel size cross 
points distance mile two either way extent excursions reef came near surface jagged points part showing 
several months passed still sail promised hope deliverance shown surface sea 
scarce day passed without seeing malay prahus passing coast always kept distance caused uneasiness fishermen 
time completed hollowing boat sides extremely thin light could paddled high rate speed 
expert paddle felt light wind vessel seen coast would enabled row reach 
might knew months even years ship could seen 
still many vessels trading among islands moment occurrence might arise 
one afternoon dozing leafy shade first awoke sat uttered cry 
almost abreast quarter mile outside reef large brig 
wind light every stitch canvas set making slow progress water 
hans leaped echoed cry seizing paddles rowed strength away opening reef passed headed ship 
saw first observed 
distance three miles astern five large prahus sails set banks oars rising falling rapidly 
brig chased pirates 
boys rested paddles moment 
match afraid said 
say hans shall go hans made reply 
never quick coming decision 
better go went 
see whether mean fight 
boys naked waist thorns forest long since torn pieces shirts landed wreck skins bronzed deep copper color still differed hue natives island men board brig regarded surprise approached 
throw us rope shouted neared

saw ship english one 
hallo spring asked captain 
shipwrecked ten months ago said living natives 
time glad see captain said present take advice get canoe row shore 
see pointed prahus chased although mean fight last mercy expected bloodthirsty scoundrels fear chances small 
looked round saw six cannons brig carried vessels trading eastern archipelago always armed already loosened ready action group men work mounting long gun raised hold 
knowing number men prahus carried felt chance successful resistance slight 
eighteen men deck number larger brig would carry seas necessary dangerous trading ground 
prahus however would carry eighty one hundred men attacking opposite sides would likely bear opposition 
suddenly idea occurred 
look sir passage reef plenty water width enough ship 
take 
passage distance 
take inside lay across channel prahus attack one side place guns strength 
captain saw advantage scheme 
capital exclaimed 
take helm lad 
ease sheets men 
nearly opposite entrance light wind blowing towards shore 
captain ordered hands reduce sail keeping enough give vessel steerage way 
two boats lowered anchor cable passed brig passed opening rest sail lowered 
boats rowed reef one either side 
anchors firmly fixed rock one taken head stern crews set work capstan speedily vessel safely moored broadside across entrance reef 
malay boats mile astern 
ceased rowing saw vessel headed land supposing captain run shore 
astonishment saw pass reef safety set work 
guns brought side facing entrance loaded muzzle bullets 
number shots belonging long gun placed bulwarks readiness hurl prahus get alongside

sink one less 
several shots fired effect malays observed jumping overboard great numbers swimming towards boats sinking condition 
four prahus turned heads towards shore rowed full speed towards ship 
knew entrance whose existence previously unaware exceedingly narrow one neared shore could see line breaking surf could wide enough one pass time accordingly one drew ahead discharging cannon carried bow rowed full speed entrance another following close behind bow almost touched stern 
train guns bear center channel captain said 
let three bow guns take first boat three second 
tom work away two behind 
prahus came along great rate sweeps churning water foam 
leading boat dashed channel sweeps grating rocks either side 
bow two yards distant side ship captain gave word 
three cannon poured contents sweeping crowded decks tearing bottom 
great speed sank water bow touched side ship 
ten seconds later command given broadside destructive poured second boat 
damage done somewhat less bow reached side ship 
dozen malays sprang board boat sank feet sailors ready musket pistol cutlass fell upon either cut drove overboard

afraid danger yet said captain shook hand 
doubt boat gone news morning half dozen fresh enemies coming inside reef attack 
breath wind might captain said 
fear none morning generally blows fresh two three hours 
know far village headquarters pirates 
far could make malays living six hours walking boats row twice fast man would walk forest 
case may attacked two three clock morning get breeze till sunrise 
channels reef captain asked

never explored far either way think action malays know might know exist 
captain said warp brig channel anchor stem stern across outside 
find hard attack us 
breeze comes slip cable run 
fast sailer think get away pirates even sails oars 
besides shifting long gun two others stern give hot even fastest may sicken

could keep coming channel pursuit safe 
ah earth captain asked 
william gale silent minute two 
plenty powder board ship sir plenty use barter 
seems went sailing could sink couple barrels powder channel fuse explode minutes left malays would astonished explosion would venture pass 
idea capital one captain said warmly fuse would burn water think tom could managed think sir mate answered 
suppose take one empty gallon beer casks fill powder hold ten twelve little barrels might bung make hole head 
hole might fix wine bottle bottom knocked fastened tow oakum water get 
might shove mouth bottle hole powder long strip paper dipped saltpetre make touch paper 
know regular fuse would might go want air would plenty keep touch paper alight 
could sling three four pounder shots bottom cask make sink upright 
slip cables might lower boats lighting fuse last thing sticking cork 
put much saltpetre might burn minutes reached powder 
worth trying rate captain said fear would burn long enough 
think instead bottle might jam piece iron tube six eight feet long head cask cut bung fit 
way could get good length fuse 
plan carried 
large cask filled powder iron tube three inches diameter six feet long fitted made water tight 
long strip paper dipped water gunpowder dissolved dried rolled tight lowered tube touched powder

hill fights afghans never come close quarters 
posted behind rocks huge boulders opposing sides keep distant musketry duel lasting sometimes days one side becomes disheartened losses exhausted ammunition

said british annihilated others repulsed attack fallen back camp soon two clock yossouf rushed william room news afghans driven heights british possession defile 
yossouf throughout morning swayed conflicting emotions wishes 
one moment hoped countrymen might conquer fear victory hindoo quarter might sacked english friend discovered killed overpowered feeling patriotism 
must remembered afghanistan centuries rather geographical expression country 
population composed great number tribes without common feelings interest often engaged desperate wars conflicts 
two leading tribes ghilzais duranees long struggled ascendency cultivated portion country 
long period ghilzais supremacy duranees lords country 
mountain tribes part held entirely independent although time gave nominal allegiance ameer cabul yet shown khurum valley hated native masters animosity far exceeding felt towards british 
throughout war tribesmen ready saw opportunity attack english convoys small columns true animated love plunder rather country considerable area afghanistan notably candahar people general would infinitely preferred mild rule english military tyranny cabul 
thus yossouf grown without understanding meaning feeling call patriotism 
true taught hate unbelievers feeling disappeared acquaintance gale ranked safety happiness friend far national consideration 
weak feeling patriotism among afghans shown fact british frontier troops consist afghan hillmen always ready called upon fight desperately countrymen co religionists 
examples treachery exhibited two pathans fired guns warn countrymen british advance spingawi pass almost unknown 
feeling joy yossouf related english friends news defeat afghan army
