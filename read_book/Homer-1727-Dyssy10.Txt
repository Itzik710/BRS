best men fell ajax achilles patroclus peer gods counsel dear son antilochus man singularly fleet foot fight valiant 
suffered much mortal tongue indeed could tell whole story though stay question five years even six could tell achaeans suffered would turn homeward weary tale ended 
nine long years try every kind stratagem hand heaven us time one could compare father subtlety indeed son hardly believe eyes talk like one would say people different ages could speak much alike 
never kind difference first last neither camp council singleness heart purpose advised argives might ordered best 
however sacked city priam setting sail ships heaven dispersed us jove saw fit vex argives homeward voyage either wise understanding hence many came bad end displeasure jove daughter minerva brought quarrel two sons atreus 
sons atreus called meeting sunset achaeans heavy wine 
explained called people together seemed menelaus sailing homeward displeased agamemnon thought wait till offered hecatombs appease anger minerva 
fool might known would prevail gods made minds change lightly 
two stood bandying hard words whereon achaeans sprang feet cry rent air two minds 
night rested nursed anger jove hatching mischief us 
morning us drew ships water put goods women board rest half number stayed behind agamemnon 
half embarked sailed ships went well heaven smoothed sea

would heaven might grant like vengeance insolence wicked suitors ill treating plotting ruin gods happiness store father must bear best may 
friend said nestor remind remember heard mother many suitors ill disposed towards making havoc estate 
submit tamely public feeling voice heaven knows ulysses may come back pay scoundrels full either single handed force achaeans behind minerva take great liking ulysses fighting troy never yet saw gods openly fond one minerva father would take good care wooers would soon forget wooing 
telemachus answered expect nothing kind would far much hope 
dare let think 
even though gods willed good fortune could befall 
minerva said telemachus talking heaven long arm minded save man care much suffered getting home provided could safe 
would rather get home quickly killed house agamemnon treachery aegisthus wife
