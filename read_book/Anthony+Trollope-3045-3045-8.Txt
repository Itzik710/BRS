one creditor fletcher butcher silverbridge late specially hard upon poor crawley 
man without good nature dealings heard stories dean good like loudly expressed opinion perpetual curate hogglestock would show higher pride allowing indebted rich brother clergyman remaining thrall butcher 
thus rumor grown 
butcher written repeated letters bishop bishop proudie barchester first caused chaplain answer told mr crawley somewhat roundly opinion clergyman eat meat pay 
nothing bishop could say enabled mr crawley pay butcher 
grievous man mr crawley receive letters man bishop proudie letters came made festering wounds end

story told mrs crawley mr walker lawyer pushing inquiries 
poor woman rate told knew 
husband told one morning butcher threat weighing heavily mind speaking humor found impossible cross question still money left though money hoped would driven use given four five pound notes told go silverbridge satisfy man eager money 
done felt doubt money forthcoming given dean 
story told mrs crawley 
could explain husband statement cheque shown altogether false passed mr walker mrs crawley lawyer gentle 
first stages inquiry simply desired learn truth place clergyman suspicion 
latterly bound follow matter officially would seen mrs crawley able escape lady importunity 
mr walker said last know husband 
one knows hard tell troubles

one think lessen world said lady 
truth sir husband often knows says 
declared money paid mr soames certainly thought 
times misery knows says forgets everything 
period mr walker suspected mr crawley anything dishonest suspect yet 
poor man probably received money dean told lie choosing taken money rich friend thinking would inquiry 
foolish would end 
mr soames means good natured belief 
pocket book got dean arabin hands said mr soames almost triumphantly 
felt sure time left crawley house mr walker wrote letter dean moment florence way rome whence going holy land 
came back letter mr arabin saying th march given mr crawley sum fifty pounds payment made five bank england notes ten pounds handed friend library deanery 
letter short may perhaps described almost curt

dean answer plain said mr walker 
says gave mr crawley five ten pound notes five notes traced mr crawley hands 
mrs crawley could say nothing beyond making protestations husband innocence

mr john eames time story young man seven eight twenty years age living london supposed friends country made mark something little common way 
know much common way except fact thousand pounds left old nobleman way related regarded great affection died two years since 
john eames poor man filled comfortable official position private secretary chief commissioner income tax board drew salary three hundred fifty pounds year resources country addition source official wealth became known undoubted possessor hundred twenty eight shares one prosperous joint stock banks metropolis property left free legacy duty lamented nobleman named mr john eames rose high indeed young man estimation knew supposed something good deal common way 
mother lived country obedient slightest word never venturing impose upon sign parental authority sister mary eames lived mother almost god upon earth 
sisters nothing even special god individual worship generous affectionate unmarried brothers sufficient incomes gods upon earth 
even london mr john eames somebody 
especially office although indeed remembered many man raw lad first came many years ago laughed played tricks customarily known without shilling last week pay day period would borrow sixpence shilling energy men felt honored smiled upon 
little stories former days would often told behind back told ill nature constant referring matters 
acknowledged every one office neither friendship nobleman fact private secretaryship acquisition wealth made proud old companions forgetful old friendships 
young men lads lately appointed perhaps little cold reasonable conceive one mr john eames could expected make intimate acquaintance every new clerk might brought office 
since competitive examinations come vogue knowing might introduced understood generally establishment may almost say civil service large wide fame mr eames averse whole theory competition 
devil take hindmost scheme called would go explain hindmost candidates often best gentlemen way devil got pick flock 
respected known subject fought hard battles chief commissioner 
chief commissioner great believer competition wrote papers read aloud various bodies civil service delight got printed sent post kingdom

stranger well known one mr crosbie belonging another public office circumstances life half known gave rise various rumors 
one thing certain one point clerk income tax office doubt one fact conduced much high position mr john eames held estimation brother clerks given mr crosbie thrashing man ever received treatment lived 
wonderful stories told thrashing believed even least enthusiastic matters poor victim dragged crippled existence since encounter 
nine weeks never said word eat mouthful said one young clerk younger clerk entering office even speak whisper take food pap 
seen therefore mr john eames much heroic 
still love love lady known every one office 
declared way amatory expressions never life opened mouth another woman office knew exaggeration 
mr cradell instance early years intimate john eames still kept old friendship 
although domestic man wife six young children living small income go much among friends could told different story mrs cradell days cradell made good claim upon unadmired cradell fellow clerk 
constancy mr eames present love doubted none knew 
went stockings ungartered old acknowledged signs unrequited affection

even house mr crawley affected mock humility though either debasement superior station clergyman entitled put equal footing visitor 
would shaken hands mr robarts intending indicate presume present accusation hanging action forced upon 
something protest manner though remonstrating thing unbecoming 
mr robarts without analyzing understood knew behind humility crushing pride pride probability would rise crush could get room 
perhaps question whether man served rightly extremities reduced 
something radically wrong within put antagonism world produced never dying grievances 
many clergymen country incomes small fallen lot mr crawley managed get without displaying sores mr crawley displayed 
wear old rusty cloaks ostentatious bitterness poverty seemed belong garment displayed mr crawley shoulders
