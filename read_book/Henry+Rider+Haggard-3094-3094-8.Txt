dr jehu fgs st andrews nb red eve murgh death knew nothing england western countries days crecy fought third edward sat upon throne 
none tell doom east whence come light life death decrees god loosed upon world 
one multitude europe ever even heard vast lands far cathay peopled hundreds millions cold faced yellow men lands grown old familiar states empires carved mountain forest savage haunted plain 
yet eyes open could see well might trembled 
king prince priest merchant captain citizen poor laboring hind well might trembled east sent forth gifts look across world beyond curtain thick darkness 
behold vast city fantastic houses half buried winter snows reddened lurid sunset breaking saw toothed canopy cloud 
everywhere upon temple squares open spaces great fires burning strange fuel bodies thousands mankind 
pestilence king city pestilence hitherto unknown 
innumerable hordes died dying yet innumerable hordes remained 
patient east bore forth still shapes love hate task done turned banks mighty river watched 
broad street ran fantastic houses advanced procession toward brown ice flecked river 
first marched company priests clad black robes carrying poles lanterns black paper lighted although sun still shone 
behind marched another company priests clad white robes bearing white lanterns also lighted 
none looked listen dirges sang eyes fixed upon filled center space upon two companions 
first companion lovely woman jewel hung wearing false flowers streaming hair beneath bared breasts kirtle white silk 
life love embodied radiance beauty danced front looking alluring eyes scattering petals dead roses basket bore 
different second companion stalked behind thin sexless none could say shape man woman 
dry streaming locks iron gray ashen countenance deep set hollow eyes beetling parchment covered brow lean shanks half hidden rotting rag claw like hands clutched miserably air 
awful fashion new death terrors 
touched neither went man naked save red girdle long red cloak fastened round throat hung broad shoulders 
nothing strange man unless perhaps strength seemed flow glance icy eyes 
burly yellow man whose age none could tell hood red cloak hid hair one seemed far removed youth yet untouched time 
walked steadily intently face immovable taking heed 
turned long eyes upon one multitude watched pass crouched upon knees solemn silence always upon one whether man woman child glance meant one 
ever one upon fell rose knee made obeisance departed though filled inspired purpose 
quay went black priests white priests red cloaked man preceded rose life followed ashen death 
funeral fires wended lurid sunset shone upon 
pillars quay fastened strange high pooped ship crimson sails set upon masts 
white priests black priests formed lines upon either side broad gangway ship bowed red cloaked man walked quite alone dead roses ashen countenance fallen back 
sun sank standing lofty stern cried aloud work done 
eating fire messenger get west 
among cease burn yet remember shall come 
spoke ropes ship loosened wind caught crimson sails departed night one blood red spot blackness 
multitude watched could see longer 
flamed mingled joy rage 
laughed madly 
cursed departed 
live live live cried 
murgh gone murgh gone kill priests make sacrifice shadows 
murgh gone bearing curse east bosom west 
look follows pointed cloud smoke vapor terrible shapes seemed move dimly trailed departing red sailed ship 
black priests white priests heard 
without struggle without complaint though taking part set ceremony kneeled lines upon snow 
naked waist executioners great swords appeared 
advanced upon kneeling lines without haste without wrath letting fall heavy swords upon patient outstretched necks grim office till dead 
turned find flowers danced tattered weeds followed purposing cast funeral flames 
gone though none seen go 
gathering darkness temple pagoda top voice spoke like moaning wind 
fools wailed voice still murgh second thing created murgh made man minister 
murgh messenger shall reappear beyond setting sun 
ye kill ye spare 
priests seemed slay summoned officers afar 
fools ye serve serves murgh gateway gods 
life death hands 
hands master murgh helper man lord eye hath seen whose behests born obey yes even mighty murgh looser burdens foolishness ye fear

let settle swiftly since unless sweat runs eyes dims seems night coming noon 
right answered sir geoffrey gathering gloom ominous fearful 
think awesome tempest must burst

wiping brow silken handkerchief returned deliver message 
hugh dick watching saw cattrina advised could find loophole argument 
saw moreover doge grew angry rose seat throwing velvet robe office appeared could longer bear weight spoke hard voice cattrina squires 
next titles combatants read cause combat went hugh bade dick bind right arm certain red ribbon eve given saying wished fight wearing lady favor 
dick obeyed muttering thought humors foolish knight might well wear woman petticoat ribbon 
dim light grown could scarce see tie knot 
indeed weather strange 
dark lowering sky palpable blackness sank downward though clouds falling weight sea great rolls vapor came sweeping like waves 
also sea found voice although calm moaned like world pain 
great multitude began murmur faces lifted upward toward sky grew ghastly white 
fear knew got hold 
voice cried shrilly let fight done 
would get home ere tempest bursts 
first trumpet blew horses knights whinnied uneasily led stations 
second trumpet blew knights laid lances rest 
ere third trumpet could sound suddenly darkness midnight swallowed scene 
dick groped way hugh side 
bide said end world let us meet like men together 
ay answered hugh voice rang hollow closed visor without doubt end world murgh minister sent open doors heaven hell 
god mercy us stayed hearkening groans prayers terrified multitude dick holding bridle horse shook head foot never stirred 
minutes remained thus till suddenly sky began lighten natural light 
color earth beneath air deep terrible red caused things seem though dyed blood 
lighter lighter redder redder grew long stand pavilions became visible dense deep ring spectators 
many kneeling others could find space kneel held hands upstretched toward heaven beat breasts wept emotional fashion country 
yet eyes hugh grey dick fixed rather single figure stood quite alone midst great arena cattrina horse indeed little 
figure clothed red yellow cap shaped like cock comb black furs yellow robe white gloves sandals 
yonder stood fantastic fearful bare brawny arms crossed upon breast head bowed though contemplated ground 
eye tens thousands present see voice break yell terror hate till earth shook sound might reverberate choked abyss hell 
fiend fiend fiend said shout 
kill kill kill figure looked red light shone upon stony face seemed one blotch white amidst glow 
stooped lifted sand knight lance cattrina held 
raised lance pointed four times east west north south holding finally direction tribune sat doge noble company venice beyond 
lastly quick easy motion cast lance toward sky whence fell remaining fixed point downward earth 
tongue mist crept sea enveloped mist cleared away shape gone 
red haze thinned first time morning sun shone sickly fashion 
although nerves torn unnatural darkness apparition followed saw yet none quite believed seen multitude shouted combat proceed 
hugh laid lance rest thinking cattrina although could see 
third trumpet rang silence sounded like blast doom hugh spurred horse forward little way halted could perceive foe advancing 
stared last rage threw lance squire turning horse galloped tribune 
pulled haunches shouted great voice cattrina fooled appear champion king england cattrina produce cattrina may slay slain chivalry venice forever shamed doge rose uttering swift commands heralds ran 
knights captains searched pavilions every place mounted man might hide 
never found cattrina returning length confessed much bowed heads 
doge maddened ignominy seized great gold chain upon beast burst two 
cattrina fled shouted 
satan carried away least let name erased golden book venice prove innocent let noble venice stretch hand fellowship 
men venice cattrina house dead 
none take cause fight asked hugh sir geoffrey presently doge command challenge repeated thrice herald 
answer came 
afterward hugh glad since cattrina life sought man 
hugh spoke saying claim illustrious written victor combat death bloodless fault mine 
shall written noble hugh de cressi said doge 
let venice take notice thereof 
words left lips solid earth began heave rock 
first heave hugh leaped horse screamed aloud fled away gripped hold grey dick 
second multitude broke wild cries prayers blasphemies rushed way 
third came quite slowly greatest long stand timber bent flags toward though salute slow grinding crash fell entangling within beneath ruin 
also city beyond houses whole streets gabled churches tall towers sank earth rose wreathed columns dust 
south sea became agitated 
spouts foam appeared upon smooth face drew back land revealing slime ages embedded therein long forgotten wrecks 
heaped like mountain swift dreadful motion advanced one vast wave 
instant multitude full flight 
hugh dick fled like rest david though whither went knew 
knew ground leapt quivered beneath feet behind came horrible seething hiss water crest men tossed like bits floating wood 
chapter xv death work presently hugh halted taking shelter two companions behind stone wall shed earthquake shattered could trodden mob fugitives 
wave spent said pointing line foam retreated toward ocean taking many drowned drowning men 
let us return seek sir geoffrey 
shameful leave trapped yonder like rat 
dick nodded making wide circuit avoid maddened crowd came safely wrecked stand last seen sir geoffrey talking doge 
every minute indeed mob grew thinner since already passed treading life fell went 
stand three fourths seated already broken since fallen utterly good fortune open sides 
however tangled canvas roof still trying escape 
poor creatures crushed death broken limbed lay helpless worse still held beneath fallen beams 
several freed whereon unharmed ran away without thanking 
long could find trace sir geoffrey 
indeed near abandoning search sights sounds sickening even men accustomed battlefields dick quick ears caught tones english voice calling help 
apparently came back doge tribune lay heap dead 
gaily dressed folk fallen flight crushed earthquake feet fellows 
blackened disfigured men women dragged away much toil last joy beneath found sir geoffrey carleon 
another minutes must died almost suffocated 
indeed would certainly perished others thrown fixed bench whence one leg projected could see crushed broken 
drew gently could gave water drink whereof mercifully since utterly parched thirst discovered large silver pitcher full standing corner little ante chamber tribune 
half hidden fragments fine dresses even jewels torn persons lords ladies 
thank friends said faintly 
prayed keep seated went mad would listen 
behind trod front till doorway choked hurled beneath bench 
oh terrible hear dying know soon must follow done leg crushed air 
drunk drunk even raging thirst satisfied found plank 
laying sir geoffrey departed human shambles whence piteous cries still imprisoned could reach pursued horribly 
thus slowly enough three two hampered mail bore sir geoffrey across place arms 
save dead dying ghoul like knaves plundered time almost deserted 
indeed large band wretches emerged like wolves lairs lowest quarters great city catching sight gold chain sir geoffrey wore ran drawn daggers kill rob 
seeing come grey dick slipped black bow case sent arrow singing heart one eyed villain captained 
thereon rest left fell ran steal slay elsewhere 
without word dick unstrung bow laid hold end plank 
came mouth street bravoes waylaid previous night find could pass way 
houses thrown ruins rose smoke hideous screams perished 
part venice home poorer folk suffered earthquake scarcely touched many finer quarters 
still reckoned afterward took toll nearly ten thousand lives 
turning street made way banks great canal ran harbor rowed place arms 
good luck found small boat floating keep uppermost overturned number people crowded 
boat righted much toil discovered within drowned lady also oar caught beneath seat 
dreadful journey easy least comparison 
gloom rolled away sun shone fresh pleasant wind blew sea toward land 
last passing many sad strange scenes need described came safely steps ambassador beautiful house quite uninjured

soon graveyards full plague pits long deep full dead taken sea shiploads cast ocean 
length even could done since none forthcoming would dare task 
became known would surely die 
folk fell lay 
houses many cumbered poisoned streets churches 
even animals sickened perished great city turned open tomb 
reek tainted air miles around even passed ships far sea turned faint presently sickened died 
ere died bore fatal gift lands 
moreover starvation fell upon place 
though houses full riches would scarce suffice buy bread remained alive 
doge council passed laws lighten misery people soon heeded laws none left enforce 
vagabonds evil minded men began robbing deserted houses jewels money plate ended searching food casting aside treasures worthless dross 
even said worse things things named since extremities nature knows shame 
bread meat scarce wine remained plenty 
midst death men yes women perhaps deserted wives husbands children fearing take evil made nights horrible drunken blasphemies revellings sailors sometimes upon sinking ship

chapter xvi avignon hard upon two months gone length three hugh grey dick david day set eyes upon towers stately avignon standing red sunset encircled blue waters rhone 
terrible beyond imagination journey men followed footsteps murgh 
saw true always saw handiwork 
death death everywhere death nothing death one night supped inn host family servants twelve folk seeming health 
rose morning one old woman little child alone remained rest dead dying 
one day surprised taken robbers desperate outcasts mountains gave twenty four hours make peace heaven ere hanged slain many band overpowered 
twenty four hours grace elapsed would easy hang remained robbers 
took best horses ill gotten gold rode leaving murderers murdered stronger power man 
went desolate villages crops rotted fields went stricken towns whereof moan stench rose foul incense heaven crossed rivers fish died thousands poisoned dead rolled seaward waters 
pleasant land become hell untouched unharmed plodded onward deeps hell 
night two slept city whereof population remained alive seemed gone mad 
one place danced sang made love open square 
another bands naked creatures marched streets singing hymns flogging till blood ran heels passers prostrated 
forerunners mad dancers following year 
field outside city came upon even dreadful sight 
forty fifty frenzied people drunk engaged burning poor jew wife two children upon great fire made staves wine casks plundered neighbouring cellars 
hugh companions came upon scene jew already burned crowd devils preparing cast wife children flames forced see devour husband father 
indeed yells brutal laughter thrusting children two great casks ere rolled heart fire wretched mother stood shrieked 
sirs asked hugh riding 
burn wizards spawn sir knight answered ringleader

thrice dick shot third deadly arrow drunken fellows grew sober enough understand wished 
suddenly acting common impulse fled away every one leaving behind fallen beneath arrows sword 
full wine could run tumbled headlong lay helpless

alas sir knight poor creature still young unhandsome jewess wailed answer whither shall go return town christian men surely murder children already murdered husband 
kill us sword bow kindness leave us tortured christian men according fashion us poor jews

children two comely little girls eight six years age thereabout dragged dreadful prisons lifted saddle 
wretched widow running bonfire snatched husband burnt hand hid bosom filthy robe 
took white ashes threw toward city muttering curses 
asked hugh curiously 
pray sir jehovah god jews every grain ashes may take life payment murdered husband think listen 
like enough answered hugh crossing woman wonder christians hold sorcerers hear prayers lips turned tragic motion pointing bones husband smouldering fire answered wonder sir wretched creatures utter prayers masters deeds answered hugh 
let us going shambles 
went melancholy procession ever one seen upon earth 
three englishmen marched behind horses weeping burdens grey dick reflected aloud fashion 
jew christian said 
jews killed one man chanced god though knew ever since christians killed thousands jews 
wicked jews killed man god said god christians throw man fire burn wife children eyes man never said god said put poison wells believed one race thirteen hundred years ago killed god ah well jew christian think devil dwells murgh alone knows truth matter 
ever meet ask 
meanwhile go avignon strange company whereof holy priests yonder still live say nothing people may demand account us 
spoke dick one seeks answer neither companions gave 
went ruined land unpursued although brought sundry men deaths 
neither law justice left killed could died must unwept unavenged 
certain travellers flying knew whither flying doom doom eyed hate loathing companions 
consorted jews must thought enemies every christian soul 
well perhaps early winter night closing reached wonderful bridge st b n zet quite unguarded since worse foe reigned avignon could fear without 
crossed unnoted none lingered gloom rain save one poor woman called loved dead went seek 
could interfere scrambled parapet bridge wild cry leapt foaming waters rushed beneath 
god forgive rest muttered hugh crossing 
others shrugged shoulders 
dreadful sights fed eyes daily till learned take little note 
deserted place farther side bridge halted hugh said jewish widow woman avignon tell us befriend let us part 
done safe either us seen together christian city 
sir speak well answered 
pleased ere separate meet perchance tell names may remember hand among people generation generation

god people thou didst save lot house flames sodom save true hearted merciful men turn sword thy wrath smites sinful cities cast cloak thy protection love prosper handiwork peace war fulfil desire upon enemies last let die full years honor gathered thy eternal bosom thus prayeth rebecca daughter onias thus shall 
leading children turned vanished darkness 
said dick gone although spoken jew men call accursed forefathers fulfilling prophecy wrought great crime world young thereby brought salvation mankind believe among comfortable words ears listened especially dealt fulfilling desire upon enemies war 
well spoke doubt registered book lost 
master let us seek lodging city avignon part light heart 
hugh nodded heart also lightened words blessing good omen 
mounting horses took street led past great roches des doms crest stood mighty palace popes yet unfinished still one vastest buildings ever seen 
battlements front gateway burned great fires lit order holiness purify air protect court plague 
leaving place right rode slowly along one principal streets town seeking inn 
soon found one large place sign three shepherds painted turned enter gateway 
saw gateway rushed mob frantic people waving swords cudgels saying would strangers bring death among 
let us go said hugh seems welcome 
went tried three inns turn 
two met like greeting doors third closed place deserted 
crowd began gather round wearily enough turned another street hazard 
thus wended way back toward great central rock thinking might find hospitable tavern 
following new street reached less crowded suburb town large dwellings stood gardens 
one saw flare fires burned city time pestilence seemed small castle 
least moat round drawbridge 
seeing lamps burned windows hugh worn long journeyings took sudden resolution 
doubtless knight dwells fine house said companions 
let us go declare names degree virtue claim hospitality right 
grumbled dick 
worse treated inns unless owner adds arrows swords cudgels 
rode across drawbridge gateway little castle open finding one small courtyard door also open 
david dismounted knocked none answered 
empty house belongs one said dick rate times 
let us enter 
saw place sumptuously appointed 
though ancient large afterward discovered fortification outer wall demolished turned purposes dwelling 
leaving hall opened refectory mounted stone stair upper chambers entered one 
saw strange piteous sight 
bed candles still burned lay young woman beautiful arrayed bride robe 
dead plague said hugh deserted death 
well better luck many since left die alone 
dress candles show 
ay answered dick fear took watchers last fled 
well fill place return morrow give honorable burial courtyard 
fine lodgings us master let us bide rightful owners cast us 
come david help raise drawbridge 
fine lodgings proved indeed since found house avignon better furnished things needful 
show dreadful times days made home never much learned name poor lady arrayed bride dress laid upon marriage bed 
butteries cellar plentiful provisions food 
eaten thankfulness chose one bed chambers slept quite undisturbed till morning sun shone window places awoke 
arose digging shallow grave courtyard garden tools found shed bore poor bride removing jewels rich enough buried wedding dress 
sad duty finished washed water well breakfasted 
eaten consulted next 
came lay certain cause holiness said hugh 
let us go palace declare business estate ask audience 
leaving david charge house named bride tower dead lady little keep rose horses stalled stable went made way great entrance pope palace 
found gates shut barred huge fire burning behind 
still knocked guards appeared armed cross bows asked business 
said desired see holiness least one secretaries whereon guards asked whence came 
replied italy told would find entrance since death come italy 
hugh gave name stated business hearing guards laughed 
annulment false marriage said captain 
go lay petition death business swiftly done already 
get gone english knight white faced squire 
want english best times least hail italy 
come master said dick ways house front door want leave brains grease hinges 
went away wondering whither betake could next 
chanced long wait answer 
presently lantern jawed notary frayed russet gown must watching movements approached asked business pope palace 
hugh told whereon lawyer finding person high degree became deferential manner 
moreover announced notary named basil tours one legal secretaries holiness living without gates palace express command order attend affairs suitors papal court great sickness 
added however able communicate within doubtless might power forward cause noble knight sir hugh de cressi already took much interest 
would fee suggested dick looking man coldly 
basil answered smirk fees legal affairs inseparable latter naturally involved former 
cared money remarked especially time general woe 
still would never lawyer however humble create precedent might used craft better days 
named sum 
hugh handed double asked whereon began manifest great zeal case 
indeed accompanied fortified house named bride tower alleged without truth never seen 
wrote particulars suit 
sir edmund acour count de noyon seigneur cattrina said presently 
think lord names audience holiness ago pest grew bad avignon gates palace ordered shut 
know passed occasion retained cause find tell morrow 
find also pleases learned basil said hugh whether knight three names still avignon 
word two say 
answered lantern jawed notary 
yet think unlikely one buy beg horse ride away stay old city unless indeed laws order bind may minister afflicted 
well pest spares morrow morning back hour tell gather 
sickness begin avignon asked grey dick 
noble squire none know certain 
autumn great rains heavy mists things contrary usual course nature strange lights shining heavens forth 
day much heat one evening man clad red yellow cap wore cloak thick black furs necklaces black pearls seen standing market place 
indeed saw 
something strange dreadful appearance man although true say common mountebank arrayed thus win pence people set upon 
hurled stones attacked swords every weapon thought killed suddenly appeared outside throng unhurt 
stretched white gloved hand toward melted gloom 
added basil nervously noted afterward tried injure man among first die pest 
thank god one 
indeed best hold back perhaps reason alive day 
strange story said hugh though heard something like cities passed 
well till morrow hour friend basil 
learned two things master said dick lawyer bowed 
first acour avignon secondly murgh messenger murgh sword avignon 
let us go seek one since part desire meet 
day sought found neither 
next morning basil reappeared according promise informed business foot 
also said likely prove difficult anticipated 
indeed understood named de noyon cattrina friends among cardinals already obtained provisional ratification marriage lady eve clavering 
ratification would costly difficult set aside 
hugh answered could granted audience holiness evidence would make justice cause plain 
sought audience 
notary scratched lantern jaws asked could brought every gate palace shut plague 
still perhaps might managed added certain sum forthcoming bribe various janitors persons authority 
hugh gave sum store gold taken robbers mountains something 
basil departed saying would return hour morrow plague spared patrons prayed saints might 
hugh watched go turned dick said mistrust hungry wolf sheep clothing talks large yet nothing 
let us go search avignon 
perchance may meet acour least gather tidings 
went leaving tower locked barred perchance would wiser follow basil 
debased fraudulent lawyer character man lived upon fees could wring without authority came lay suits papal court playing upon hopes fears pretending power possess 
done might seen turn certain side street sure none watched slip portal ancient house visitors rank accustomed lodge 
mounting stairs without meeting one house like many others seemed deserted time pestilence knocked upon door 
begone whoever growled voice within 
neither sick tended dead borne away 
hear hugh dick might found voice familiar 
noble lord replied notary basil come upon business 
maybe said voice know near case foul sickness bring fear lord waiting healthy sick task leave others taste way 
door opened cautiously room beyond came pungent odour aromatic essences 
basil passed shutting quickly behind 
side table near blazing fire stood acour 
clothed long robe held piece linen soaked strong smelling substance nose mouth 
nay come nearer said clerk infection subtle good cast filthy cloak leave door 
basil obeyed revealing undergarment still foul 
one wasted money new apparel 
well man said acour surveying evident disgust throwing handful dried herbs upon fire news cause laid holiness trust know grow weary cooped like falcon cage dread loathsome death handful frightened servants companions nothing drone prayers day long 
yes lord 
straight clement secretary answer holiness attend matter pest passed away avignon 
adds also ever parties cause representatives must appear 
give ex parte judgment upon issue letters reached appears complicated doubtful 
mother heaven exclaimed acour fool let tell tidings 
well say sooner hateful city better 
ride afternoon need walk foot 
indeed said basil 
leave behind frightened health bide upon similar errand 
doubtless often happens bold find way fulfil 
may fellow bold warlike knight squire hair like tow face might worn death young english serving man
