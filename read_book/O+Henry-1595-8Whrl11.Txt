commissioner went work silently obstinately putting back grief far possible forcing mind attack complicated important business office

law entitled one possessing certain state scrip file virtue upon land previously legally appropriated 
scrip hands land sharks 
thus cost hundred dollars often secured lands worth many thousands 
naturally search vacancies lively 
often often land thus secured though legally unappropriated would occupied happy contented settlers labored years build homes discover titles worthless receive peremptory notice quit 
thus came bitter unjustifiable hatred felt toiling settlers toward shrewd seldom merciful speculators often turned forth destitute homeless fruitless labors 
history state teems antagonism 
mr land shark seldom showed face locations eject unfortunate victims monstrously tangled land system let emissaries work 
lead every cabin moulded balls many brothers enriched grass blood 
fault lay far back 
state young felt need attracting newcomers rewarding pioneers already within borders 
year year issued land scrip headrights bounties veteran donations confederates railroads irrigation companies colonies tillers soil galore 
required grantee scrip properly surveyed upon public domain county district surveyor land thus appropriated became property heirs assigns forever 
days trouble began state domain practically inexhaustible old surveyors princely yea even western american liberality gave good measure flowing 
often jovial man metes bounds would dispense altogether tripod chain

nearly every old survey state contained excess land 
later years state became populous land values increased careless work entailed incalculable trouble endless litigation period riotous land grabbing little bloodshed 
land sharks voraciously attacked excesses old surveys filed upon portions new scrip unappropriated public domain 
wherever identifications old tracts vague corners clearly established land office would recognize newer locations valid issue title locators 
greatest hardship found 
old surveys taken pick land already nearly occupied unsuspecting peaceful settlers thus titles demolished choice placed either buy land double price vacate families personal belongings immediately
