yes flow brittle demanded mrs stoutley 
ay pint professor said captain nodding flow bein made hard brittle ice rolling higgledy piggledy course said lewis flippantly came sat end sofa humor everybody consequence utterly failed gain attention nita horetzki although made unusually earnest efforts join conversation father 
owing somewhat similar feelings artist flung chair sat glaring black fireplace degree concentration ought lighted firewood therein 
cause glacier flowing said professor long disputed point 
men science held pressure ice snow behind causes flow 
think flows like water say forced behind crushed gorges valleys unwillingly 
say left alone without additions time forward glaciers would longer move would rest slowly melt away motion due fact miles miles snow fields thousands feet deep mountain tops gorges fresh snows added every winter weight behind slipping slopes falling cliffs crushes forward thus glaciers choose advance 
ay ay said captain doubt doubt may bein brittle glass glacier come rumblin clatterin valleys small hard bits like ten thousand millions smashed chandeliers ay rub exclaimed lewis say ha exclaimed professor smiling blandly touched philosophers seems still great difficulty 
great men held glacier ice always partially soft viscid semi fluid condition somewhat like pitch although apparently solid brittle rigid body flows sluggishly reality 
philosophers denied theory insisting ice glaciers like pitch like glass squeezed without broken drawn without cracked 
philosophers discovered ice subjected great pressure melts pressure removed part melted immediately freezes hence name regelation freezing given process 
thus glacier say many places continually melted continually instantaneously frozen made pass narrow gorges open enormous pressure removed 
theory regelation although unquestionably true although exercises influence glacier motion opinion alone account 
opinion seems favor among learned men hold firmly theory scottish professor forbes namely glacier semi fluid body largely impregnated throughout extent water particles move round past words flows precisely manner water difference quite fluid sluggish flow certainly models ground forced gravity rent broken fragments compelled turn sharp angles pass steep convex slopes 
forbes careful measurements investigations proved incontestably glaciers central portion traveled valley double treble rate sides without continuity mass broken 
small masses indeed glacier ice appearance rigid large scale unquestionably ductile 
theory regelation put proof asked lewis degree interest glaciers never felt 
answered professor 
experimentalist cut bar solid ice like bar soap form size glacier 
iron weight several pounds suspended means fine wire tied round bar 
pressure wire melted ice water escaped instantly froze wire thus wire went cutting way bar water went freezing last weight fell ground left bar solid entire never cut 
well said captain wopper bringing hand thigh slap arouse mrs stoutley languor professor lecture glacier ice sailed round world seen many strange sight got say believe see 
shall see soon hope said professor blandly ever intend verify experiment along several others

primarily verify man science always goes forth happy consciousness mine proposes dig rich gems seeking one sort may light upon another unexpectedly 
captain wopper turned yonder gem lit one purest water unquestionably brilliant specimen class belongs said lewis coming moment pointing projection somewhat steep part path winding

chapter eleven 
pursuit science difficulties 
first burst enthusiasm interest abated attention party became engrossed proceedings professor assistants began adjust theodolite fix stakes ice 
thus engaged captain wopper regarded mer de glace gaze fixedness intense draw attention arouse curiosity friends 
see anything curious captain asked emma chanced stand beside 
coorious eh repeated captain slowly without altering gaze adding reply 
monsieur le capitaine lost consternation said nita smile 
think miss horetzki said lewis probably mean admiration 
knows w mean demanded nita quickly 
ha proper pertinent question observed slingsby audible though tone 
nevair put pertinent questions sir said nita turning black eyes sharply though something twinkle mad artist 
poor slingsby began explain nita cut short turning lewis demanding knows w mean uniform propriety thoughts mademoiselle replied lewis continental bow air pretended respect induces suppose words misinterpret 
nita knowledge english remark gave hazy idea youth meaning accepted however apologetic explanation ordered awaken captain find riveted attention

ice sure answered captain 
say professor ee mean tell whole mairdy glass movin answered professor pausing minute arrangements looking spectacles captain amused expression

look hour hand watch ten minutes see move see reality passed small appreciable space time 
said professor ere long show thing regard ice 
bet ten thousand pounds returned captain assured nod 
colours nailed said lewis say captain added remonstratively thought sworn enemy gambling 
betting gambling young man answered captain always bet ten thousand pounds sterling never mean pay lose accept win gambling 
put pipe smoke take advice go look friend slingsby gambolling yonder another fashion soon bring grief stopped 
eyes turned towards mad artist finding advances mademoiselle nita well received time forsaken returned first professional love 
wooing clambered almost inaccessible cliff hoped obtain sketchable view mer de glace captain wopper drew attention making frantic efforts swing branch tree projecting rock slightly attached parent cliff weight would probability hurled precipice 
remonstrative shouts friends however induced desist sat work less perilous position 
meanwhile professor completed preliminary preparations ordered assistants go fix stakes ice 
arranged scientific experiments progress young ladies ramble neighborhood search flowers plants care lewis two clock hour assemble montanvert hotel luncheon captain wopper lawrence resolving remain assist least observe professor 
former indeed bearing mind great ruling wish even midst scientific doubt inquiries suggested latter also accompany ladies country somewhat rugged ladies especially miss emma sure footed lawrence disappointment declined saying ladies sufficient protector gallant lewis miss emma unquestionably surest footed whole party 
lawrence therefore remained professor request accompanied party fix stakes ice 
operation attended considerable difficulty danger describe process 
finding spot first chosen observations good one professor changed position point farther steep sloping rocks form left bank glacier des bois 
theodolite fixed 
instrument even young readers may probably know small telescope attached stand three long legs spirit levels means fixed position may say exact flatness reference center earth

better object pint observed captain whose enthusiasm quite great excitement much greater professor 
carefully directed telescope extreme point dook nose professor ordered one assistants go glacier stake 
lawrence descended thus planted foot glacier ice first time lewis afterwards remarked pursuit scientific knowledge 
clambering slowly among loose boulders debris left glacier previous years professor carefully sketched duke wellington nose rocks etcetera immediately around notebook might easily recognized returning spot future day 
assistant sent first stake proved rather stupid fortunate accompanied lawrence guide antoine grennon stirred perceptions 
rough signalling made stand near place first stake driven 
telescope lowered man made signals move plant stake upright position point intersection spider threads fell exactly bottom stake 
pre arranged signal made point auger hole bored deep ice stake driven home 
much number one said captain wopper look satisfaction 
fix ones easily observed professor examining stake telescope great care 
right 
first stake planted far shore lawrence party proceed straight line glacier steep portion descent vale chamouni rent dislocated tortured extent covered huge blocks pinnacles ice seamed yawning crevasses 
clamber ice ridges almost impossible order avoid pinnacles crevasses quite impassable frequent detours made 
object ice party merely cross glacier difficulties would great necessity always returning straight line pointed inexorable theodolite led positions considerable difficulty 
inexperienced lawrence also appeared positions great danger much amusement antoine accustomed fearful ice slopes abysses higher regions looked upon work mere child play 
come different notion crevasses sir said quiet smile bin among seracs grand mulet couloirs monte rosa 
doubt antoine said lawrence gazing feelings awe terrible split ice whose beautiful light blue sides deepened intense blackness lost vision abyss arose deep toned gurgling sub glacial streams must forget quite new feet yet aware precise grip must hold slippery foundation 
truth discredit lawrence felt tendency shrink edges chasms appeared ready break walked caution ice slopes led unfathomable holes said slopes although steep undoubtedly slippery 
much clambering ridge length gained second stake set party proceeded onwards fix third difficulties proved greater 
huge block ice fixed upon would suit purpose stood like peninsula midst crevasse connected main body ice neck looked sharp knife upper edge none tight rope slack wire dancers could proceeded along even performers would found edge brittle sustain 
show monsieur mountaineer skill said man carried stakes antoine

thus cut cut step step passed block ice aimed 
short neck 
notches sufficient yet without axe cut notches place absolutely impassable

antoine knew like wise guide took proper precautions

found scrambling serrated ridge whose edge wide strong enough sustain

natural instinct self preservation strong upon lawrence darted across narrow ridge firm ice rear dispensing entirely extreme caution marked first passage 
indeed tight rope slack wire dancers formerly referred could performed feat greater lightness rapidity precision 
stake drivers followed almost similar alacrity 
even guide retraced steps without delay necessary permit picking stakes proper custodians left behind alarm guides merely young inexperienced porters 
shame lads said antoine laughing shaking head bad specimens men chamouni learn coolness ice 
one would thought coolness ice almost unavoidable consequence surrounding conditions yet lawrence seemed contradict idea face appeared unusually warm laughed said shame lies antoine set example history goes prove even brave men swept away influence panic act one cowardly man may produce 
lawrence spoke french porters understood appreciated defense antoine would means encourage fallacy 
cowardly sir said spring quickly danger one understand nature young men chamouni ought good understanding nature ice danger great indeed would necessitate leaving tools behind

ah know retorted even known ledge snow immensely stronger stood

true youth back towards hunter walked behind might seen question received startled look strange gleam shot man eyes 
question repeated answered 
yes said low voice say found never found 
sought much sought 
answer given promptly lewis found surprise subject appeared distasteful hunter 
therefore dropped walked silence 
walking time comparatively easy sharp frost hardened surface snow gem like lights heaven enabled traverse valleys ice clamber snow slopes cross crevasses without danger except one two places natural snow bridges frail chasms unusually wide 
one crevasses brought complete standstill 
wide leaped bridge found 
movements glacier cause continual shifting parts although rugged smooth spots always sure found parts glacier year nevertheless annual variety minute detail 
hence expert guides sometimes puzzled routes 
crevasse question new one antoine first ascent mont blanc year explore passage never 
party turned left marched along edge chasm distance bridge could found 
ice became broken smaller crevasses intersected large one last place reached chaos dislocation rendered advance impossible 
lost bearin antoine asked captain wopper

crossed configuration ice forced adopt route would willingly avoided 
steep incline snow rose right heights loose ice grags poised point falling 
indeed two three tracks passed probably distant period avalanches shot

draw near grand summit said professor pointing snow cliffs right whence originates ice fountain supplies mighty ice rivers glacier des bossons mer de glace 
oui monsieur replied antoine smiling draw near yet near 
nearer summit however plain retorted professor 
truly yes assented guide 
think one could doubt observed slingsby looking upwards 
looks quite near said lewis 
near however think shall find rejoined guide resumed upward march 
indeed true 
nothing deceptive inexperienced eye apparent distance high mountain top 
imagine plain miles miles away peak close hand find perhaps consulting watch plain far distant greater part work still lies 
requires small amount resolution bear depression spirit caused frequent mistakes matter 
owing increasing height power sun snow beyond petit plateau soon became soft steepness ascent increasing advance became slower work much laborious 
pleasant break however hand reaching grand plateau cheered sun rays beaming directly information length reached breakfast point

man without intellectual food becomes lower animal 
intellectual man without material food even part day let testify misfortune go pic nic discover essential element diet forgotten

push accordingly except guide difficulty hoping 
passed plateau sun poured floods light snow little crystals shone prismatic colors though place strewn diamonds

passing grand plateau reached steep incline rose towards tremendous ice precipice 
upper edge hung gigantic icicles

antoine however thought might prove strong enough 
patted snow gently previous occasions similar kind advanced caution followers fixed heels snow held tight rope save break 
passed safety others followed new difficulties awaited side 
beyond bridge came slope snow completely swept leaving surface hard ice exposed 
steep walking impossible 
antoine therefore proceeded cut steps along face

doctor lawrence especially felt much anxiety overheard one two conversations held guides subject young englishman recklessness 
really lewis said doctor one occasion must listen lecture measure charge 
attention sir said lewis meekly sat edge bed folded hands lap 
well begin said doctor half serious smile trouble opinion attach weight pardon lawrence attach great weight rather much weight scarcely bear 
therefore 
must admit opinion good guide worth something 
heard antoine grennon day laying unquestionable principles professor lecturing professor interrupted lewis presumptuous 
said continued doctor dangers connected ascent swiss mountains real unless properly provided may become terrible fatal 
instanced tendency go roving among glaciers alone 
comrade guide attached rope danger worth speaking must clear mountains alone step snow covered crevasse break instant death inevitable 
yes objected lewis unwillingness convinced one chief characteristics youth always walk alone glaciers utmost caution sounding snow front long handle axe every step go 
guides find always sufficient protection amazing power self sufficiency persuade sufficient demanded lawrence 
question suffices doctor said lewis laughing go lecture attention humility 
lecture retorted lawrence guide strong assure subject men going high glaciers without rope comes thing alone less severe foolhardy ignorant cross steep slopes ice new fallen snow 
nothing easier new snow affording good foothold told us day describing adventures cliffs monte rosa yet nothing dangerous says antoine snow slip apt would smothered swept crevasse 
lives lost alps every year told owing indifference two points 
guides say opinions corroborated men science alpine experience dangerous meddle slope exceeding degrees several days heavy fall yet certain slopes exceeding angle traversed annually travellers ignorant reckless 
say slope crossed day steeper angle snow twenty four hours old guilty exclaimed lewis sigh 
condemn said lawrence smile continuation lecture assured punishment much lighter deserve 
listen three unavoidable dangers alpine climbing please long head pleaded lewis throwing back bed friend placed point finger right hand corresponding point left crossed legs 
shall brief brief life likely attend 
three dangers said unavoidable two may guarded 
first danger falling rocks 
danger may styled positive 
hangs head like sword damocles 
avoiding except climbing boulders ice blocks perched everywhere one tell moment shall fall 
secondly danger crevasses danger tumbling one crossing bridge snow danger breaking crust snow conceals one 
may called negative danger 
reduced almost nothing tied comrade rope leader sounds staff walks along changes negative positive danger man mad go alone 
thirdly danger new snow steep slopes positive step recently fallen slope steep negative allow sufficient time harden 
however certain many deaths occur three dangers neglected equally true largest number accidents occur alps arise chiefly momentary indiscretions false steps result carelessness self confidence men attempting beyond powers 
men old fatigue men though young sufficiently strong usually come grief 
close lecture quotation writings celebrated mountaineer cases man rather mountain fault 
truth say observed lewis rising yawn 
nay returned friend seriously mother made anxious reckless expeditions begged impress truths

le croix looked round pondered 
like diverging unknown parts hurry day far spent said 
one never knows sheer precipice shut way places like 
youth however confident man experience amiable yielding

therefore decided steeper slopes attempted 
began glissade 
steep snow slope happened close hand 
stretched uninterruptedly several hundred feet one terraces precipitous mountainside place cut

hunter shook head

daylight blessed daylight often longed sick weary imperfectly appreciated whose chief thoughts experiences night fitly expressed couplet bed bed delicious bed rest weary head 
daylight came last intense relief poor lewis become restless interminable night wore cold seemed penetrate marrow 
although unable sleep however lay perfectly still anxious interrupt rest companion 
le croix like sleep soundly awoke several times towards morning began dream mutter short sentences 
first lewis paid attention length becoming weary thoughts set half amused feeling listen 
amusement gave place surprise touch sadness found word gold frequently dropped sleeper lips 
thought poor fellow really say half crazed gold hunter hope 
seems nonsensical 
never heard gold mountains 
yet may much longing gold said turn people crazy 
wonder 
thoughts proverbial wanderers wayward spirit easy restraint 
often honest refuse flatter 
youth lay back gazing dreamily giddy height first faint tinge light suffused eastern sky thoughts rambled channel 
strange chamois hunter become gold hunter 
much respectable former occupation yet many gold hunters world gamblers gold hunters gambler aha mr lewis cap fitted fitted say fits still 
playing billiards every night nearly since came despite captain wopper warnings lesson got poor leven poor leven indeed little gold robbed 
however paid back one comfort stakes mere trifles enough give interest game 
yet shame lewie take interest game sake smallest coin staked involves spirit gambling 
boy know well enough let conscience speak 
nita seems like ah nita good gold good ten million times better finest gold 
wonder queer careworn look comes angel face hears say game billiards might whisper flattering things reference seems much put one else talks 
ah nita unnecessary follow youth thoughts got upon nita immediately ceased wayward wandering practices remained fixed theme 
soon afterwards light sufficient mountaineers rose continued descent accomplished much toil trouble proceeded quick pace glacier towards place chamois left previous day 
fond gold le croix said lewis abruptly half jesting tone walked along 
hunter countenance flushed deeply turned look severity towards companion 
said fond good friend mine replied lewis light laugh 
friend mine returned hunter contracted brows

expression hunter changed completely 
seemed struggle indignation sorrow breast stopped facing companion said vehemence monsieur count friend 
ever found self greatest enemy 
good god knows hard fought self years often oh often beaten overcome

weary struggle 
lecroix countenance tones changed rapidly cloud forms mountain peaks 
last words uttered deepest pathos pale face turned upward sought hope source higher everlasting hills 
lewis amazed sudden burst feeling one unusually quiet sedate stood looking silence 
young man resumed hunter calmer tone laying large brown hand impressively youth shoulder heard aright 
loved gold much 
resisted temptation first might escaped shall yet saved ay despite self saviour years sought gold among mountains 
tell found never found 
day intended visited yonder yellow cliffs high shoulder pass

evil spirit gone day perhaps ever

wrenched round spoke hand invisible spirit holding hurried quickly towards wide crevasse crossed path place 
better tie together attempting suggested lewis hastening 
le croix answer quickened pace run 
exclaimed lewis sudden alarm 
almost wide leap snow side overhangs 
stop god sake rushed forward late 
le croix already brink chasm next moment tremendous bound cleared alighted snow beyond 
weight snapped mass arms thrown wildly aloft shout rather cry fell headlong dark abyss horror stricken unable move cry lewis stood edge 
far blue depths crevasse arose terrible sound heavy blow 
followed familiar rattling masses falling ice seemed die away profound heart glacier 
weary struggle come end last 
chamois hunter found tomb like many alas bold hearted countrymen among great fields ice often sped sure foot cool head days gone 
lewis thoroughly convinced late comrade dead seen mangled corpse sort passionate unbelief refused admit fact 
stood perfectly motionless transfixed frozen act bending crevasse 
listened intently long sound yet knew could never come 
oppressive sickening silence reigned around suddenly broke great terrible cry recovering stupor hurried wildly fro seeking slope might descend rescue friend 
vainly sought 
walls crevasse sheer precipices clear ice 
one spot indeed found short slope madly seizing axe cut foot holds descending quite regardless danger slope became perpendicular admit farther progress 
struck alarm returned cautiously top beads cold perspiration stood pale brow 
minutes became sufficiently calm realize fact poor le croix indeed beyond hope 
truth forced heart covered face hands wept bitterly 
long ere passionate burst feeling subsided 
lewis impressionable young heart recoiled agony shock 
although hunter nothing pleasant guide felt lost friend 
mind capable connected thought dwelt unfortunate man kindly modest bold disposition especially incidents previous night two lain side side like brothers hard couch 
last rose feeling dead weight crushing spirit began think continuing descent 
felt although hope rescuing life still time lost rousing guides chamouni recovering possible remains 
thoughts came upon rush 
still high among great cliffs alone vale chamouni still far distant bewildered route whatever direction turned nothing met eye save wildly riven glaciers jagged cliffs peaks 
stood midst scene savage grandeur corresponded somewhat feelings 
knowledge ice craft may use expression time considerable felt sufficient work lay besides knowledge possessed could make want companion rope add distress weakness resulting partly hunger began tell 
perhaps well thoughts interfered unmanned served rouse spirit nerve exertion 
feeling life god depended wisdom vigor promptitude actions next hours raised eyes upward moment perhaps first time life asked help guidance creator feeling strong upon help guidance sorely needed 
almost commencement descent event occurred taught necessity extreme caution 
slipping axe 
left fatal crevasse hundred yards behind came fracture ice rendered impossible advance direction longer therefore turned aside met snow slope terminated another yawning crevasse 
standing top endeavoring make mind best route followed chanced swing axe carelessly let fall 
instantly turned edge shot like arrow slope 
ice man enough know loss axe circumstances equivalent signing death warrant face flushed gush feeling resulted accident 
fortunately head weapon caught lamp ice edge crevasse handle hung 
something akin desperation took possession youth 
slope far steep slide 
axe impossible cut necessary steps 
case excessively dangerous although snow new lay incline least weight might set motion case inevitable death would result 
case critical admit delay thought 
hazards axe must recovered 
therefore lay face slope began kick foot holds toe boots 
exceedingly slow laborious work dared kick force lest lose balance indeed retained thrusting arms firmly upper holes fixing one foot deep lower hole cautiously kicked new step succession 
last toiling steadily thus two hours regained axe 
grip seized handle tender feeling afterwards laid shoulder created new idea strange affection man brought regard inanimate objects fervency condemned former flippancy vowed never go high alps alone formed striking commentary adage experience teaches fools time lewis advanced speed caution 
point vantage reached made rapid careful survey ground decided exact route take far eye could range refused every temptation deviate save insurmountable obstacles presented shape unbridged crevasses sheer ice precipices 
obstacles painfully numerous indomitable perseverance sometimes desperate venture overcame 
got involved succession crevasses ran found last walking edge wedge ice foot broad unfathomable abysses either side 
wedge terminated last thin edge deep crevasse beyond 
retrace steps tenth time place struck could reach side crevasse right might gain level patch ice appeared communicate sounder part glacier beyond 
paused drew breath 
much leap 
ordinary circumstances could bounded like chamois weak hunger fatigue besides wedge stood rotten might yield bound opposite edge seemed insecure might fail like mass proved fatal le croix 
felt venture desperate way yet long day declining 
screwing courage sprang powerful shudder shook frame alighted safe side 
farther glacier came level stretch began walk greater speed neglecting little precaution driving end axe handle snow front step 
result stepped suddenly snow concealed narrow crevasse 
sank sending something like galvanic shock frame 
shock effected tired muscles might failed accomplish 
caused fling backward cat like agility thus escaped narrowly 
needless say thereafter proceeded degree care caution might done credit even trained mountaineer 
last lewis found necessary quit glacier scale mountains way pass led gorge hoped reach vale chamouni 
great perplexity aspect country unfamiliar eye feared must lost way 
nothing decision however prompt action could serve 
vacillated retraced part steps would involved spending second night among icy solitudes without shelter felt fatigued fasting would quite beyond powers endurance 
therefore crossed bergschrund crevasse glacier cliffs snow bridge faced mountain side toiling upwards reached summit pass little sunset 
fortunately weather continued fine country appeared much less rugged passed yet got clear difficulties 
lay longest ice slope couloir hitherto encountered 
snow completely swept surface bore evidence channel rushed boulders obelisks ice strewed plain 
reach plain route would involved circuit unknown extent 
risk great danger delay greater 
swung heavy axe round head began tedious process cutting steps 
apt scholar profited well lessons taught le croix others 
quick yet measured firm stroke 
forced calmness rested face ice blocks apparently nodding fall warned make haste fear slipping foot losing balance compelled cautious 
case rope round waist friend would inestimable value 
two thirds way exhausted youth forced stop seconds rest 
several pieces ice size man head rushed couloir dashed close past

fearing prelude something worse quickly cut way side couloir 
moment soon 
glancing alarm saw foundations one largest ice masses give way 
top bent slowly first fell forward crash broke smaller fragments dashed like lightning slope leaping side side carrying huge rocks masses debris plain horrible din 
poor lewis felt spirit body shrink 
however chosen position well 
nothing save cloud dust snow reached part slope passed swept clean besom destruction 
awful ordeal one young inexperienced risk encountered 
sooner better thought immediately swayed aloft axe lifting heart maker second time day 
minutes stood foot couloir 
without moment pause hurried finally reached lower slopes mountains 
inexpressible joy thankfulness fell sheep track following soon high road valley
