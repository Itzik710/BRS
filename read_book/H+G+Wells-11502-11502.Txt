shows flight first piece human machinery heavier air ever kept length time 
model little affair would lifted cat went spiral came unsmashed bringing back like noah dove promise tremendous things 
sixteen years ago amusing recall cautiously even believers prophesying 
quite desperate fellow said outright lifetime see men flying 
qualified repeating many years come would enterprise quite fantastic daring skill 
conjured stupendous difficulties risks 
deeply impressed greatly discouraged paper distinguished cambridge mathematician produced show flying machine bound pitch fearfully flew pitching must increase went nose went tail fell like knife 
exaggerated every possibility instability 
imagined aeroplane kicking ahind afore would heeling lightest side wind 
sneeze might upset 
contrasted poor human equipment instinctive balance bird ten million years evolution way start waterplane soared eastbourne morning mr grahame white steady motor car running asphalt 
went anticipations swaying insecurity speculations psychological physiological effects flying 
people look top cliff high tower feel slight qualms dread many feel quite sickening dread 
even men struggled high air asked smitten lonely reeling dismay lose self control pitching tossing make quite horribly sea sick always little haunted last dread 
gave little undertow funk mood lively curiosity got aboard waterplane morning sort faint thin funk readily invades one verge new experience one tries one first dive example pushes first time ice run 
thought probably sea sick precise air sick thought also might giddy might get thoroughly cold uncomfortable none things happened 
still state amazement smooth steadfastness motion 
nothing earth compare unless judge ice yacht traveling perfect ice 
finest motor car world best road would joggling quivering thing beside

morning looked directly little fleet fishing boats passed crowds assembling beach bathers stared us breaking surf entirely agreeable exaltation 
eastbourne early morning sunshine brightly detailed littleness town viewed high side great mountain 
mr grahame white told going plane confess tightened hold sides car prepared something like going sensation switchback railway larger scale 
moment familiar feeling something pressing one heart towards one shoulders one lower jaw socket grinding one lower teeth upper passed 
nose car machine slanting downwards gliding quickly yet feeling one rushed even one rushes coasting hill bicycle 
tithe thrill three descents one gets great mountain railway white city 
one gets disagreeable quiver one backbone wheels real sense falling 
quite peculiar flying one incredulous collision 
time ago motor car ran killed small dog wretched little incident left open wound upon nerves 
never quite happy car help keeping apprehensive eye ahead 
fly exhilarating assurance possibly run anything run anything except land sea even large essentials seem beautifully safe distance away 
heard great deal talk deafening uproar engine 
counted headache among chances 
reason reinforced conjecture 
early morning mr travers came brighton farman flew could hear hum great insect still seemed abreast beachy head good two miles away 
one hear thing two miles much one hear distance two yards risk seeming contented anything assert heard noise one hears drone electric ventilator upon one table

development waterplanes important step towards huge swarming popularisation flying certainly imminent 
ancient survivors believed wrote flying flying used make great fuss dangers difficulties landing getting 
wrote vast gravity starting rails landing stages still true landing aeroplane except upon well known quite level expanse risky uncomfortable business 
getting landing upon fairly smooth water easier getting bed 
alone likely determine aeroplane routes along line world coastlines lake groups waterways 
airmen go fro water midges 
wherever square mile water waterplanes come go like hornets mouth nest 
much stronger reasons convenience keeping water 
water air seems lies great level expanses even gales moves uniform masses like swift still rush deep river

nothing shameful 
plain simple idea mind man street completely prepared 
already crept social legislation extent thirty shillings 
suppose one fact hammered us past two decades supply children falling modern state births particularly good quality births abundant enough birth rate particularly good class birth rate falls steadily needs future 
one else said word important matter ex president roosevelt would sufficed shout ends earth 
every civilised community drifting towards race suicide rome drifted race suicide climax empire 
well absurd go building civilisation dwindling supply babies cradles best possible sort suppose hardly intelligent person english speaking communities thought possible remedy naive scoldings mr roosevelt stolid periodicals sane intelligible legislative projects 
reasons fall birth rate obvious enough 
necessary consequence individualistic competition modern life 
people talk modern women shirking motherhood would silly sort universe large proportion women natural instinctive desire shirk motherhood believe huge proportion modern women passionately predisposed towards motherhood ever women 
modern conditions conspire put heavy handicap upon parentage enormous premium upon partial complete evasion offspring clue trouble lies 
social arrangements discourage parentage heavily rational thing statesman matter grow eloquent intelligent things minimize discouragement 
consider case energetic young man energetic young woman modern world 
long remain unencumbered subsist comparatively small income find freedom leisure watch follow opportunities self advancement travel get knowledge experience make experiments succeed 
one might almost say conditions success self development modern world defer marriage long possible defer parentage long possible 
even family strongest temptation limit three four children outside 
parents give three children opportunity life prefer turn let us say eight ill trained children disadvantage become servants unsuccessful competitors offspring restrained 
fact bites us require search 
well rant race suicide clear hard conditions contemporary circumstances really rich patent doubt eloquence mr roosevelt myriad echoes added thousand babies eugenic wealth english speaking world 
modern married people particularly capable middle class children urgently desirable statesman point view going one two children please going larger families existing conditions though ex presidents pulpits world clamor together 
rearing children private affair one right revile small families public service parent justified looking state recognize service offer compensation worldly disadvantages entails 
justified saying unencumbered rival wins past state precious service world rearing educating family state become debtor 
words modern state got pay children really wants particularly pay children good homes 
alternative racial replacement social decay 
essential idea conveyed phrase endowment motherhood 
paying done needs elaborate answer give roughest crudest suggestion 
probably would found best payment made mother administrator family budget amount made dependent upon quality home children reared upon health physical development upon educational success 
remembered want children want good quality children 
amount paid would particularly point vary standing home 
people excellent class spends hundred year child ought get much state people class spends five shillings week per head would get 
payments met special income tax would social injustice whatever unequality payment 
social stratum would pay according prosperity redistribution would effect occur would childless people class would pay children class 
childless family small family would pay equally large family incomes equal would receive proportions varying health general quality children 
think gives broad principles upon payments would made
