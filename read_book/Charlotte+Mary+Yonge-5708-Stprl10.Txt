stray pearls memoirs margaret de ribaumont viscountess bellaise preface one aware author construction tale defective 
state french society strange scenes fronde beguiled tale become rather family record novel 
formerly muse historical romance independent arbitrary personage could compress time resuscitate dead give mighty deeds imaginary heroes exchange substitutes popular martyrs scaffold make stubborn facts subservient purpose 
indeed favored son boldly asserted right bend time place purpose make interest effectiveness work paramount object 
critics lashed erratic ways become meek hand maid clio creeping obediently track greater muse never venturing coloring working grand outlines mistress left undefined 
thus present tale though would far convenient spread story length time made catastrophe depend upon heroes heroines instead keeping mere ineffective spectators engaged imaginary adventures precedent found necessary stretch narrative least consistent real history entire sacrifice plot 
may feared thus story may partake confusion really reigned tangled thread events 
portion history better illustrated memoirs actors therein fronde perhaps reason none confusing 
perhaps may assistance reader lay bare historical outline like map showing incidents memoirs sisters ribaumont conform

suppose countenance showed certain dismay explained might old woman fancy knowing french notions nobility rank treated honest gentry without titles like dirt feet thought ought warned 
though part young gentleman papist frenchman see mistress nan could much better even england 
began giving instances barons daughters marrying gentlemen learned law listened dismay knew would serve make sister determined really true passion dawning 
saw english breeding would seem unworthy would us mother would shocking could tell brother would look 
recommendation eyes would contrary namely might led embrace religion thought clement darpent doubtful catholic would likely lead away 
confidence chiefly bourgeois pride likely suffer pay addresses would disdained family scrupulous good faith would certainly prevent taking advantage absence maiden mother brother
