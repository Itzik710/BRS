hitherto journey one long record mud mosquitoes misery otherwise devoid incident except eating one boatmen crocodile particularly early riser pulled poor fellow canoe lay asleep night 
however real dangers begin since spot left great river started forward forest foot jeekie four bearers paid highly accompany 
could conceal undertaking seemed somewhat desperate 
said nothing long letter written barbara previous night sighing sealed thought might well last would ever reach even boatmen got safely back calabar remembered put post 
enterprise begun must carried ended success death 
hour later started 
first walked alan leader expedition carrying double barrelled gun could used either ball shot fifty cartridges brass cases protect damp revolver hunting knife cloth mackintosh lastly strapped upon back like knapsack tin box containing fetish little bonsa precious trusted anyone else 
quite sufficient load white man climate wiry alan feel weight rate first 
single file came four porters laden small tent tinned provisions brandy ammunition box containing beads watches etc presents blankets spare clothing forth 
stalwart fellows enough knew forest dejected air showed come face face dangers heartily wished anywhere else 
indeed notwithstanding terror jeekie medicine last moment threw loads intending make wild rush departing boat met jeekie anticipating move waiting bank shotgun 
remained canoe far stream reach swimming 
asked wished sit starve devils would leave company would carry bargain like honest men end took loads marched behind walked terrible gigantic jeekie barrels shotgun carried full cock occasionally used prod pointing directly backs 
strange object looked truly addition weapons bristled several cooking pots slung say nothing cork mattress mackintosh sheet tied flat bundle shoulders box containing medicines food carried head fastened top string like helmet coffin enormous solar tope stuffed full mosquito netting ends fell like green veil 
alan remonstrated cork mattress suggesting thrown away hot wear jeekie replied cold thirty years wished get warm 
guessing real reason declining part article master something lie damp ground alan said time seen fortunate enough jeekie 
mile road ran fantastic looking mangrove trees rooted mud mist resembled alan thought many legged arboreal octopi feeling food tall reeds tops sat crowds chattering finches 
sun broke strongly cheering warmth sucking vapors entered sparse bush palms great cotton trees growing length came borders mighty forest 
oh dark dark forest entered cheerful sunshine felt though suddenly without preparation wandered light know dim hades old greek fancy painted strengthless ghosts flit aimlessly mourning lost light 
everywhere giant boles trees shooting height church tower air without branch great rib rooted trees beneath fierce hungry growth creepers 
tree fallen within last century creepers ramped upwards luxuriance stems thick body man drinking shaft light pierced downwards drinking eagerness ere boughs met starved 
tree fallen creepers thin weak year year lived feebly biding time still lived knowing day would come 
always coming expectant parasites since minute minute somewhere vast depths miles miles away perhaps great crash echoed stillness crash tree sown saxons ruled england perhaps cleopatra bewitched anthony came end last 
second day march forest alan chanced see tree fall sight one never could forget 
happened owing vast spread branches killed rivals beneath day successful tree embued excellent constitution parent stood somewhat alone several hundred yards away six human beings crept towards like ants towards sapling cornfield mighty girth bulk set upon little mound luxuriant greenness far reaching boughs made kind landmark 
hot noon breath wind stirred suddenly end came 
suddenly mighty bole seemed crumble suddenly far reaching arms thrown together support failed gripping like living things flogging air screaming last agony awful wailing groan sinking tumbled ruin earth 
silence midst silence jeekie cheerful voice 
old tree go flop glad flop us thanks little bonsa 
get lazy nigger dog 
pay stand snivel get blow stupid skull brought muzzle full cocked double barrelled gun sharp contact part terrified porter anatomy 
forest 
march first four days nothing tell 
depths seemed devoid life although occasionally heard screaming parrots treetops couple hundred feet caught sight dim shapes monkeys swinging bough bough 
daytime although could see knew sun shining somewhere 
night heard nothing since beasts prey come food 
puzzled alan impenetrable recesses ran distinct road followed 
right left rose wall creepers ran road ancient road nothing grew turned aside avoid biggest trees must stood time immemorial tree seen fall indeed one round road ran 
asked jeekie made road 
people come noah ark answered jeekie think run get way water sent two elephants ahead make path 
perhaps dwarf people make 
perhaps go asiki land sacrifice like old jews 
mean know said alan 
course know 
know forest path made beginning world 
ask question major answer 
lively answer shake head roll eyes like silly fool porters 
fourth night trouble began 
usual lit huge fire made fallen boughs rotting tree trunks lay plenty 
reason fire large since little cook air hot made reason jeekie answered questions sake cheerfulness 
least gave light darkness leaping red tongues flame twenty thirty feet high roar crackle welcome primeval silence 
alan lay upon cork mattress open need pitch tent rain fell canopy leaves absorbed 
amusing smoked pipe watching reflection fire light patch darkness caused probably bush twenty yards away picturing mind face barbara strong pleasant english face might appear background 
suddenly identical spot see face though one different character 
round small hideous resembling general outline bloated child 
distance could distinguish features except lips large pendulous flash white teeth 
look whispered jeekie english jeekie looked without saying word lifted shotgun lay side fired straight bush 
instantly arose squeaking noise might made wounded animal four porters sprang alarm 
sit said jeekie tongue leopard stalking us fired frighten away 
go near place may wounded angry drag boughs make fence round fire fear others 
men dreaded leopards looking animals indeed superstitious reverence obeyed readily enough plenty wood lying within yards soon constructed boma fence rough would serve protection 
jeekie said alan presently labored fence leopard man 
major man little dwarf devil poisoned arrow 
shoot make sit 
think come back night much afraid shot fetish 
morrow say 
tell fellows anything nodded towards porters perhaps bolt 
think would done better leave dwarf alone said alan might left us alone 
blood feud us 
agree major chance us put blue funk 
shoot presently shoot made sound resembled whistling arrow added go sleep 
tired watch eyes see dark better 
two days damn forest open land tree dwarf come afraid lion cannibal man like eat 
nothing else done alan took jeekie advice time fell fast asleep wake till faint light want better name called dawn filtering canopy boughs 
look said jeekie handed coffee 
hit dwarf man see blood think others carry away 
jeekie good shot stone spear arrow gun 
get quick porters smell rat 
eat chop major pack 
presently started trudge endless trees fear companion 
even porters told nothing seemed afraid usual though whether smell rat jeekie called owing progressive breakdown nervous systems alan know 
midday stopped eat men tired walk without rest 
hour looking comparatively open place chanced could find none obliged halt dense forest 
finished meal preparing proceed feared happened since somewhere behind tree boles came volley reed arrows 
one struck porter neck one fixed alan helmet without touching less three hit jeekie back stuck providentially enough substance cork mattress still carried shoulders feeble shafts strength pierce 
everybody sprang curious fascination instead attempting anything watched porter hit neck somewhere region jugular vein 
poor man rose feet great deliberation reminding alan grotesque way speaker suddenly called address meeting seeks gain time gathering thoughts 
turned towards vast audience trees stretched hand declamatory gesture said something composed voice fell upon face stone dead swift poison reached heart done work 
three companions looked moment next yell terror rushed forest hurling loads ran 
became alan never learned saw dwarf people keep secrets 
time indeed scarcely noticed departure otherwise engaged 
one hideous little assailants made bold success ventured run across open space two trees showing moment 
alan gun hand mad rage happened raised swung would upon rabbit 
quick practiced shot skill fail dwarf vanishing behind tree bullet caught next instant seen rolling upon side 
nice said jeekie reflectively nice indeed think best move 
hurt gasped alan 
back full arrows 
feel nothing major answered best cork mattress stores good poisoned arrow leave behind perhaps points work run one scratch trick spoke jeekie untied string several strings letting little mattress fall ground 
great pity leave goods said jeekie surveying loads porters cast away says book life raiment 
also take thought morrow 
dwarf people us 
come major make tracks dashing bag cartridges cast neck trifling addition impedimenta small case potted meats hitched arm poked master back muzzle full cocked gun signal time start 
keep cursed thing said alan furiously 
often told never carry firearms full cock one thousand times major answered jeekie imperturbably occasion forget discreetness 
run family story long tell 
cut major cut like hell 
dwarfs back soon puffed think think little bonsa come square one day 
alan cut huge jeekie blundered along paraphernalia hung rattling like hoofs galloping giraffe 
load ever turn hair 
whether fear within desire save master belief virtues little bonsa foot upon native heath fact remained notwithstanding fifty years almost whitened wool jeekie absolutely inexhaustible 
least end fearful chase lasted day night also dared camp appeared nearly fresh started old calabar spirits fail one moment 
light came following morning however perceived many signs tokens dwarf people 
arrows shot even fell short 
pooh said jeekie right much afraid 
still time coffee best get 
got could till towards midday forest began thin 
light grew stronger could see dwarfs appeared several hundred keeping parallel course either side thought safe distance 
try one shot think said jeekie kneeling letting fly clump little men scattered like covey partridges leaving one number kicking ground 
ah boy shouted jeekie derision like bullet tummy know paradox guaranteed flat trajectory yard 
remember next time sonny 
went long rise 
river side rise said jeekie 
think tree monkeys follow us 
monkeys appeared angry determined 
would come within range paradox still marched either side two fugitives knowing well last strength must fail would able creep murder 
chase went till alan began wonder whether would better face end 
say die change mind morrow morning gasped jeekie hoarse voice 
top rise much nearer thought 
oh aunt pointed large number big men armed spears marching side hill river ran 
moment savages two hundred yards away caught sight pursuers appeared ridge right left 
dwarfs perceiving strangers uttered shrill yell terror wheeled fly fastnesses forest evidently regretted ever left 
late 
answering shout spearsmen extended long line apparently hunting game charged full speed 
fresh legs long 
therefore soon overtook dwarfs even got front heading forest 
end may guessed save reserved alive killed mercilessly almost without loss since little forest folk terrified exhausted shoot poisoned arrows weapons 
fact alan discovered afterwards generations war since tribes hate dwarfs look upon dangerous human monkeys never big men found chance squaring account 
jeekie saw fearful looking company first time spirits seemed fail 
ogula exclaimed groan sat upon flat rock pulling alan beside 
ogula know hair spears repeated 
gum tree say good night 
gasped alan 
great cannibal major eat man eat us night perhaps morrow morning nice cool 
say prayers major quick time waste 
think shoot ogula two first said alan grimly stood lifted gun 
shoot good

stronger god muttered stronger god bounded forward 
following path ran beside canal plunged tunnel holding 
minutes place full cedar trees outside wall gold house evidently tunnel passed rose behind 
beneath cedar trees flitted like ghosts moonlight shadow 
great fall back town left front lay one arms river spot raging torrent much hundred feet width spanned narrow suspension bridge seemed supported two fiber ropes 
hither side bridge stood guard hut dismay hut ran three men armed spears evidently cut 
one men sped across bridge took stand end two posted path entrance 
mungana slacked speed said one word finished jeekie also hesitated turned pointed behind 
alan looked back flitting cedar trees saw white robes priests bonsa

rope three clung desperately resting feet upon edge swaying plank 
seconds remained thus afraid stir jeekie called climb major climb like one monkey 
look bad quite safe really 
nothing else done alan began climb shifting feet along plank edge hands along rope creaked stretched beneath threefold weight 
horrible journey imagination took least hour 
yet accomplished last found huddled together safe upon bank 
sweat pouring head almost blinded alan deadly nausea worked within sickly tremors shot spine brain swam 
yet could hear jeekie excitement always took form speech saying loudly think man liar say great papas monkeys 
never look monkey

wait bit stop little game springing three four cuts big curved knife severed remaining rope pursuers reached side chasm 
shouted rage long bridge swung back rock cut end falling torrent waved spears threateningly

hope sure answered alan bethinking big bonsa wallowing screaming water bleeding white blood shivered little 
time advancing trot mungana running like dog entered bush pierced wandering paths 
along paths sped hour hour jeekie leading without moment hesitation 
met man heard nothing except occasional weird sounds alan put wild beasts jeekie mungana said produced ghosts 
indeed appeared jungle supposed haunted asiki would enter night unless bold protected many charms day either 
therefore excellent place fugitives sorely needed good start 
length day began dawn reached main road crossed hills whence journey thither alan first view bonsa town 
peering edge bush perceived fire burning near road round five six men seemed asleep 
first thought avoid mungana creeping alan jeekie would approach whispered asiki ogula chief slaves left bonsa town yesterday 
crept nearer fire saw 
rejoicing exceedingly awoke old chief fahni first thought must spirits 
recognized alan flung knees kissed hand owed liberty 
time fahni said alan 
give us food 
chanced plenty since asika orders slaves laden much could carry 
ate ravenously ate told fahni something story escape 
old chief listened amazed like jeekie asked alan killed mungana would killed 
alan mood long explanations answered kept might useful 
yes yes friend see exclaimed old cannibal although thin always make meal two pinch 
truly white men wise provident 
like ants take thought morrow 
soon swallowed food started together although alan pointed fahni might safer apart old chief real affection would persuaded leave 
let us live die together said 
jeekie abandoning main road led stream walking water footsteps might leave trace thus away barren mountains rose great swamp 
crest mountains alan turned looked back towards bonsa town 
far across fertile valley hateful river encircled place 
fell great cataract roar lived many weeks 
black cedars gleamed roofs gold house prison dwelt asika dreadful fetishes priestess 
like vision nightmare could scarcely think real 
yet time doubtless sought far wide 
mood wondered would asika learned escape fashion would greet recaptured taken back well would recaptured 
still cartridges would fight till killed failing save last 
never never could endure dragged back bonsa town live die 
went across mountains till afternoon saw road running beneath like ribbon end lagoon 
rested held consultation ate 
across lagoon could escape without canoe 
lord said mungana presently yesterday cannibals let go swift runner sent forward commanding good boat provisioned made ready doubtless done 
let descend road walk bay ask boat 
look yonder far away tongue land covered trees juts lake 
make way thither nightfall chief row back take us canoe 
alan said plan good jeekie shook head asking would happen fahni finding safe upon water thought wisest come fetch 
alan translated words old chief whereon fahni wanted fight jeekie slur cast upon honor 
challenge jeekie resolutely declined saying already plenty ways die asiki land without adding another 
fahni swore tribal god spirit every man ever eaten would come promontory dark still alive 
separated fahni men slipping road without seen anyone alan jeekie mungana bore away right towards promontory 
road long rough though good fortune met one since dwelt wild parts gone bonsa town present great feast sun sinking ever reached place 
moreover promontory proved covered dense thorn scrub must force way gathering darkness without hurt difficulty 
still accomplished length quite exhausted crept point hid stones water edge 
waited three long hours boat came 
gum tree major said jeekie 
old blackguard fanny bolt leave us morrow morning asika nobble us 
better gone bay steal boat leave behind asika want 
alan made answer 
tired although trusted fahni seemed likely enough jeekie right perhaps cannibals able get boat 
well done best fate overtook fault 
began doze even imminent peril could keep eyes open presently awoke start sleep thought heard sounds paddles beating quiet water 
yes dimly seen mist canoe seated stern fahni 
danger gone also 
woke companions slept side silently rose stepping rock rock till reached canoe entered 
large craft barely big enough hold indeed found room sign fahni oarsmen gave way heartily within half hour lost sight accursed shores asiki land although presently mountains showed clearly beneath moon 
meanwhile fahni told tale 
appeared reached bay found asiki headman dwelt state considerable excitement 
rumours reached someone escaped bonsa town thought mungana 
fahni asked brought rumor whereon headman answered came dream would say 
demanded canoe promised people headman admitted ready accordance orders received asika demurred letting 
long argument followed midst fahni men got canoe headman apparently daring use force prevent 
pushing messenger arrived bonsa town reeling exhaustion tongue hanging jaws called white man escaped servant mungana although believed still hidden holy woods near bonsa town none allowed leave bay 
headman shouted fahni return pretended hear rowed away anyone attempt follow 
still nightfall dared put boat return headland pick alan others promised 
say 
alan thanked heartily faithfulness paddled steadily putting mile mile water asiki land 
wondered whether seen last country inhabitants 
something within answered 
sure asika would allow depart peace without making desperate effort recapture 
far away seemed could feel fury hanging like cloud cloud would burst rain blood 
doubtless would burst already accident companions still supposed hiding woods 
error must discovered would come pursuit 
looked full moon shining upon reflected hour seated upon chair state wedding rather wedded asika presence big little bonsa people 
eye fell upon mungana also destined play prominent part ceremony 
saw something wrong man 
curious change come emaciated face 
working like maniac 
foam appeared upon dyed lips haunted eyes rolled thin hands gripped side canoe began sing rather howl like dog baying stars 
jeekie hit head bade silent took notice even hit heavily 
presently came climax 
man sprang canoe causing rock side side 
pointed full moon howled loudly pointed something seemed see air near gibbered though terror 
eyes fixed upon water stared 
harder harder stared head sinking lower every moment till length without another sound quietly unexpectedly went side boat 
seconds saw bright colored garments sinking depths vanished 
waited expecting would rise 
never rose 
shot weighted corpse could disappeared finally completely 
thing awful silence usual broken jeekie 
gay dog gone said reflective voice 
old ghosts come fetch proper time 
good run away ghosts travel quick one jump pop expect 
well place jeekie spread comfortably empty seat adding like hello swello room much better company go scent bath every day stink much water never wash clean 
thus died mungana poor wretch requiem 
shiver alan reflected insane jealousy might expected go scent bath face painted like chorus girl 
would escape spell destroyed predecessor affections priestess bonsas would dim power drawn mungana death drag back arms asika torture pit great swimming head 
remembered dream treasure hall shuddered thought undergone seen made superstitious bade men paddle faster ever faster 
night rowed taking turns rest except alan jeekie slept good deal consequence awoke dawn much refreshed 
sun rose found across lagoon thirty miles borders asiki land almost spot river traveled months flowed lake 
whether chance skill fahni steered wonderfully straight course 
however face face new trouble scarcely begun descend river discovered dry season year many places shallow allow canoe pass sand mud banks 
evidently one thing done abandon walk 
landed ate store food began terrible toilsome journey 
either side river lay dessicated swamp covered dead reeds ten twelve feet high 
doubtless beyond swamp high land order reach existed would obliged force path miles reeds 
therefore thought safer follow river bank 
progress slow since continually must make detours avoid quicksand creek also stones scrubby growth delayed fifteen twenty miles good day march 
still went steadily seeing man food exhausted living fish caught plenty shallows young flapper ducks haunted reeds 
length came main river tributary flowed camped thankfully believing pursuit undertaken abandoned 
least alan rest believed jeekie 
following morning shortly dawn jeekie awoke master

good suggestion one acted without delay 
taking red embers blew flame lit torches applied reeds width several hundred yards

began advance along river bank running steady trot ground open 
day ran pausing intervals get breath night rested must

time explanation retreated across little stream ran valley four thousand prepared battle 
evening however fighting first asiki reached top rise saw fugitives escaped enemy strength halted finally retired 
alan fahni also hoped pursuit abandoned jeekie shook big head saying major know asiki little ways 
one alive dare go back asika without major 
perhaps suggested alan might treat 
major asika never leave bonsa town law priests make another asika kill catch 
council war held decided camp night since position good meet attack one made ogula afraid caught march backs towards enemy 
alan glad enough hear decision quite worn ready take risk hours rest
