sleeping snow 
cold comfort naturally suggested bed snow yet enjoyed great comfort much warmth bed 
friend lumley particularly fond warmth physical ease yet often expressed opinion much emphasis nothing enjoyed much night snow bed 
jack lumley chum fine manly fellow vigorous hardy frame kindly heart 
natural leaning towards sort undefinable sympathy inclined us seek company quiet unobtrusive way 
neither us demonstrative express regard made protestations undying friendship drew together somehow especially hunting expeditions numerous 
holidays two week outpost american backwoods dwelt young fellows cleaning gulls arranging snow shoes day work lumley wont say intend shoot day max max abbreviation real name george maxby 
think go willows round beaver creek 
half mind go way 
come along 
would go together day 
one morning lumley said north river come pleasure camp 
well first time 
know thermometer stood forty zero morning breakfast know mercurial fellows like freeze easily 
condescend reply set preparing expedition resolving carry largest blanket camping implied sleeping snow 
course must guard readers especially juvenile readers supposing purpose night undress calmly lie pure white winding sheet frozen world great west time wrapped four months 
snow bed like beds required making postpone making till bed time 
meanwhile let us follow steps lumley taller stronger always led way 
leading way trackless wilderness snow averaging four feet deep harder work one might suppose 
could done without aid snow shoes varying three five feet length enable traveller walk surface snow would otherwise sink less according condition 
newly fallen soft sinks six eight inches 
somewhat compressed time wind sinks inch two 
hard surface exposed lakes rivers beaten appearance marble dispenses snow shoes altogether slings gun carries shoulder 
first mile lay clump pine wood snow recently fallen 
looked comrade broad back observed vigor action trod deep virgin snow every stride scattering aside like fine white powder lifted foot thought admirably fitted pioneer wilderness work dauntless persevering men go forth add world geographical knowledge lead expeditions sent search lost heroes franklin livingstone 
work comparatively light 
merely tread beaten path 
however thereby secured disaster found advanced half mile right shoe caught twig held moment breaking loose allowed pitch head violence almost reached mother earth four feet surface 
kind plunge always awkward owing difficulty rising usually disagreeable owing manner snow stuffs neck ears nose eyes mouth open convenient crevice person garments 
snow shoes serviceable become exasperatingly obstructive 
struggle two minutes got head clear winked snow eyes blew mouth nostrils looked 
lumley standing bland smile amiable face seldom laughed though sometimes chuckled mean grinning like cheshire cat exclaimed lend hand mean tumbling like christmas goose retorted look stumps twigs made amends reply extending hand helping rise 
minutes clear pine wood came upon piece swampland stunted willow bushes showed tops surface snow

frozen bottom except middle dark unseen waters flowed silently six feet solid ice many river channel lake distant sea 
fact save suggestive form banks river might mistaken elongated plain piece open land 
surface snow exposure wind sun hard pavement 
therefore took snow shoes necessity maintaining indian file position removed walked abreast 
air keen remarked lumley pulling thick shawl round neck far mouth well developed nose would permit 
said following example greater success nose snub 
wind even breeze seldom temperature slight movement air caused advance sufficient make one appreciate intensity cold 
became necessary pay frequent attention noses cheek bones toes prevent frostbite 
sun brilliant air invigorating

behold camp said lumley 
inviting present said slowly toiled mound weary walked twenty miles weighted heavy flannel lined deerskin coats blankets cooking utensils besides small quantity pemmican sugar tea ship biscuit axes firebags 
true cooking utensils simple consisting two tin kettles two tin mugs 
dreary indeed lonesome desolate eerie mound got top

silently vigorously cold increasing felled several small dead trees afterwards cut lengths four feet 
cleared space snow ten twelve feet diameter reached solid earth using snow shoes shovels 
threw hole formed embankment round snow lay spot full four feet deep thus raised surrounding wall chamber height six feet 
standing edge ever deepening twilight looking abyss darkened overspreading pines hole snow suggested tomb rather bed

took considerable amount time labor lumley stood last strike light flint steel tinder felt pretty well exhausted 
night time become profoundly dark insomuch grope various articles required 
rather late beginning make camp said watched sparks 
never mind max boy shall soon right replied friend one sparks last caught tinder

bundle blanket formed pretty good pillow 
wrapping tightly round another blanket physical heat evaporates quickly frozen regions lay 
friend lay beside feet towards fire 
silent interval lying thus gazing overhanging branches stars twinkled clear frosty sky thoughts became serious

conversed freely whatever chanced enter minds things past present come 
spoke god saviour redemption sin 
discursive tendency minds prone diverged home civilised lands contrasting life wild woods great west 
became sleepy converse discursive times even incoherent midst lumley reverted unfinished exposition grossness enthusiasm nature slowly working back wakeful condition put abrupt end discourse drawing prolonged snore 
deceptive snore unworthy success yet succeeded 
friend turned round contented sigh went sleep 
brief space snore fiction became reality thus bed snow depths arctic night heart frozen wilderness mighty fire burned slowly unitedly took departure land nod

time came another break monotony outpost life possible powerful exciting influence us arrival winter packet 
point must beg reader pardon asking go still desolate remote outpost 
one two hundred miles nearer pole little post muskrat house lay beetling cliff near banks affluent great saskatchewan river 
charge peter macnab mentioned command army six men two women held post comers chief comers north wind jack frost 
poor macnab jovial sociable scottish highlander condemned worse siberian banishment one active enterprising pushing fellows service fur traders

saying macnab rose drew small table near stove laid upon large desk made pine wood placing sheet paper thereon began write 
sheet paper merits notice 
like man wrote extremely large several sizes bigger foolscap loosely ruled 
said communication outer world possible twice year highlander resolved usual make opportunities

accordingly went men house introduced stranger whose name indian tongue signified big otter 
men received much joy angel light

go dunregan big otter big otter ready anything moment notice daylight glimmered faintly east following morning macnab sat table devouring venison steaks pancakes tea 
big otter sat opposite condescended use chair order level table 
chair gave much anxiety however 
evidently feared fall upset rising reach food opposite tilted back received tremendous though unacknowledged start crash followed 
half hour later macnab left interpreter charge establishment beating track snow shoes forest four wolfish looking dogs following sled load provisions bedding big otter bringing rear 
day turned bright calm frosty

true frost scarcely said represented highlander temperament truth saying extremes meet may admissible say intense cold effect expanding water ice rent rocks might appropriately compared intense warmth macnab feelings effect bursting bosom breath air stirring two men passed forest struck upon marble surface great lake lay distance two miles establishment 
sun rising time horizon ocean like lake gloriously bright cheering though appreciable warmth beams 
diamonds innumerable glittered frosted willow boughs snow travellers tread gave forth peculiar squeak chirping sound indicative extreme arctic frost breath mouths came like white puffs locomotive settling breasts thick hoar frost silvering locks straggled beyond margin caps

know whether dogs intellectually well physically powerful beyond fellows understood uncomplimentary term lost tempers certain words sooner uttered hindmost dog made unprovoked assault dog front 
course latter defended 
dog next probably pugnacious could resist temptation join leader feeling doubt better world fashion fell upon rest remarkable fury 
thus sled traces dogs instantly became tumultuous mass yelling gasping heaving twisting confusion 
big otter carried short heavy whip 
without uttering word quietly proceeded flog mass subjection 
difficult duty perform big otter strong persevering 
prevailed time 
mass disentangled subdued dogs went humbly forward journey thus auspiciously begun continued nightfall

soon blankets spread fire replenished mighty logs travellers lay side side minutes snored concert flames leaped upwards sparks entangling snow encrusted branches bush tree gleamed instant escaping flew gaily away wintry sky 
two men sleeping change came scene slow gentle scarce perceptible change however powerful influence prospects sleepers 
sky became overcast temperature arctic depth many months suddenly rose temperate climes snow began fall small sharp particles fur traders great northern wilderness accustomed broad heavy flakes one often sees england 
softly silently gently fell like descent sweet influence steadily persistently continuously every object nature became smothered soft white garment 
among objects two sleepers buried 
snow began powdering 
one observe process would seen bright light camp fire green blankets wrapt became piebald first assumed greyish green color speedily changed greenish gray finally pure white 
two sleepers might thus represented figures chiselled marble tombs crusaders lay doubled warmth perhaps also comfort knees chins instead flat backs hands pressed together 
degrees correct outline forms became incorrect outline gradually rotund suggesting idea buried ones fat 
night wore snow accumulated lay several inches deep

strong tired healthy men easily moved 
fire course sank degrees reached point failed melt snow quickly smothered covered 
entire camp also buried tin kettle capped knob peculiarly snow shoes implements appropriate outline hundredweights tons white drapery gathered branches overhead 
altogether overwhelming state things evidence life scene little hole front slumberer nose issued intermittent pufflets white vapor 
night passed morning dawned wintry sun arose like red hot cannon ball 
macnab awoke start sat effort

let reader imagine leadership involved little manhood 
northern snow shoes five feet long twelve fifteen inches broad 
netting frames filled somewhat like bottom cane chair allows fine well frozen snow fall like dust traveller sinking may inches old well settled snow progresses ease 
heavy fall described takes place especially spring weather grows comparatively warm traveller circumstances change greatly worse 
new snow light permits sink deep perhaps eight ten inches every step also soft falls upon shoes pass netting sticks giving many extra pounds weight lift goes heavily along
