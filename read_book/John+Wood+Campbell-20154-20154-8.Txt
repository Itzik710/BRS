stretched yawned broadly 
red soon eat called 
shut wake others replied low voice rear swift little patrol ship 
see anything several million stars replied evans lower voice 
tone became suddenly severe 
assistant murphy remember manners addressing superior officer 
mind report 
flaming head hair topping grinning face poked around edge door 
lower wavelength lower wavelength may think sun planetoid 
like know chief pilot russ evans locate ship forlorn way place like three quarters billion miles planetary plane 
ships ever come pirates chance help wrecked ship 
sit watch fellows work 
exactly 
watch tell ships go 
chow ready asked russ looking small clock giving new york time 
uh think time come eat 
evans took one look telectroscope screen snapped 
tiny molecular towing unit hand pointed toward door combined galley lunch room glided wake murphy 
much fuel left asked glided dizzily spinning room 
cylindrical room spinning high speed causing artificial weight foods materials made eating food less difficult task 
expertly maneuvered guide rail near center room caught spiral 
braking motion soon glided length landed feet 
bent flexed muscles waiting busied assistant get floor reply 
gave us two pounds extra 
lord knows 
must expect us clean fleet 
makes four pound rolls left untouched two thirds original pound 
fifteen days six go 
main driving power rolls amount left three pound rolls reserve bin replied red holding curiously moving coffee pot strove adjust rapidly changing air velocities neared center room 
sounds like fleet power stock 
martian lead terrestrial isotope asked evans tasting warily peculiar dish 
say energy food 
thought get till saturday 
change energy less flavored pastes made principal bulk space pilot diet prevent eating energy used walking weightless ship indeed welcome change 
uh huh 
got hungry 
objections grinned irishman 
none replied evans fervently pitching 
seated controls snapped little switch caused screen glow flashing swirling colors telectroscope apparatus came life 
thousand tiny points flame appeared scattered black field suddenness made seem snap suddenly 
points tiny dimensionless points light save one tiny disc blue white flame old sol distance close one billion miles slight reverse magnification 
skillful hands controls turning adjustments disc flame seemed leap toward hundred light speeds growing disc large dime instant myriad points stars seemed scatter like frightened chickens fleeing growing sun screen 
points heretofore invisible appeared grew rushed away 
sun shifted center screen smaller reddish green disc came view planet atmosphere coloring light left toward red

earth spread took center screen 
world portion world continent fragment continent magnification increased boundlessly seemed 
finally new york spread across screen new york seen air strange lack perspective 
buildings seem slant toward point stand vertical distance billion miles vision lines practically parallel 
titanic shafts glowing color early summer sun appeared hot rays sun miles away shimmering colored metal walls 
new airlines building mile half high supported various points actual spaceship driving units riot shifting rainbow hues 
new trick construction used evans smiled 
arcot inventor ship carried suggested fuller designer ship building 
colored berylium metal wall ruled lines inch mere scratches nevertheless diffraction grating 
result amazingly beautiful 
sunlight split rainbow colors reflected millions shifting tints 
air supported tiny packs strapped backs thousands people moving floating wished direction elevation 
none helicopters even five years ago 
molecular power suit far convenient cost nothing operate buy 
perfectly safe requiring skill everyone owned 
watcher space mere moving snaky lines barely distinguishable dots shivered seemed writhe refractions air 
passing seeming pass almost strange perspectiveless view shadowy forms giant space liners titanic streamlined hulls 
streamlined good reason save looked faster graceful efficient spherical freighters passenger liners two centuries earlier steam engines carried four funnels used two 
space liner spent minute portion journey atmosphere really inefficient streamline 
long muttered russ grinning cheerily familiar sunlit city 
eyes darted chronometer beside 
view seemed taken ship suddenly scudding across heavens like frightened thing ran across manhattan island followed hudson short way cut across new jersey swinging great woodland area kittatiny park resting finally new jersey suburb new york nestled kittatinies blairtown 
low apartment buildings ten twelve stories high nestled waving green trees old roadways 
ground traffic ceased streets torn parkways substituted 
quickly view singled single apartment great smooth roof enlarged screen absolute maximum clarity till magnification simply resulted worse stratospheric distortion 
broad roof white strips material making huge v followed two russ watched hand control steadying view earth complicated orbital motion rotation corrections ship orbital motion making job one requiring great skill 
view held center amazing clarity 
something seemed happening last crumpled suddenly rolled disappeared 
time grinned russ happily 
tried magnification 
could tired terribly suddenly tired 
took hands viewplate controls relaxed dropped sleep 
made tired wonder god straightened jerk hands flew controls 
view machine suddenly retreated flew back velocity inconceivable 
earth dropped away ship apparent velocity thousand times light tiny ball pinpoint gone sun minute disc gone apparatus flashing views focus side ship 
assistant reply 
evans hands growing ineffably heavy whole body yearned sleep 
slowly clumsily pawed little stud 
somehow hand found ship reeled suddenly little jerks code message flung beam tremendous power sheer radiation pressure made noticeable 
earth would notified 
system would warned 
light slow crawling thing would take hours cross gulf space radio travels faster 
half conscious fighting faculties pilot turned screen 
ship strange glistening thing streamlined nth degree every spare corner rounded till resistance irreducible minimum 
great pilotport stranger patrol pilot saw faces gasped surprise saw terrible faces blotched contorted

long silent ship hovered near turned pointed toward pinhead matter glowed brilliantly flaming jewel box heavens 
gone instant rushing toward sun earth speed outraced flying radio message leaving ship guard patrol behind leaving pilot leaves story 
chapter ii canine people said arcot puffs certainly great boon rocket patrol must admit 
like dueling space pirates using molecular rays since molecular rays tremendous commercial value prohibit sale ray apparatus 
come workshop fuller give demonstration friend morey help 
four friends rose morey wade fuller following arcot laboratory thirty seventh floor arcot research building 
went arcot explained fuller results principles latest product ingenuity triumvirate arcot morey wade come called news dispatches 
know molecular rays make molecules piece matter turned upon move desired direction 
since supply new energy make body turned upon supply using energy random molecular motion heat practically impossible stop 
energy necessary molecular rays take effect small usual type filter lets enough pass 
ship equipped filters better attacked one without 
rays simply drove front end rear vice versa tore pieces pirates desired 
rocket patrol could kill pirates lost many men process phyrric victory 
time morey working something stop rays 
obviously means usual metallic energy absorption screens 
finally found combination rays better frequencies wanted 
apparatus 
want course usual job rearranging stuff apparatus made dies put quantity production 
official designer aal ought easily 
arcot grinned fuller looked amazement apparatus arcot picked bench workshop 
get worried laughed morey got lifting unit combined plain ordinary molecular lift see hundreds 
morey pointed great window thousands lift units carrying men women children air lifting hundreds thousands feet streets doors buildings 
ordinary molecular pistol 
going put suit rise five feet floor 
turn pistol see impression makes suit 
fuller took molecular ray pistol wade helped arcot suit 
looked pistol dubiously pointed heavy casting iron resting one corner room turned ray low concentration pressed trigger button 
casting gave low scrunching grind slid toward lurch 
instantly shut power 
ordinary pistol 
got seven eight times ordinary power exclaimed 
oh yes forgot morey said 
instead fuel battery early pistols used space distortion power coil 
pistol much power usual power unit commercial work 
time morey explained changes fuller arcot suit floating five six feet air like grotesque captive balloon 
ready fuller guess certainly hope suit claimed 
well rather commit murder 
work said arcot 
bet neck suddenly surrounded faintest auras strange wavering blue light like hazy corona volt power line 
try 
fuller pointed pistol floating man pushed trigger 
brilliant blue beam molecular ray low hum air rushing path director beam stabbed toward arcot 
faint aura suddenly intensified million times till floated ball blue white fire 
scarcely visible air blazed bluish incandescence ionization 
increase power suggested morey 
fuller turned power 
blue halo shot tiny violet sparks sharp odor ozone air stifling heat wasted energy making room hotter 
power increased tiny sparks waving streamers laced across surface blue fire 
little jets electric flame reached along beam ray 
finally full power molecular ray reached entire halo buried mass writhing sparks seemed leap air man head wavering extinction 
room unbearably hot despite molecular ray coolers absorbing heat air blowing cooled air room 
fuller snapped ray put pistol table beside 
halo died went moment later arcot settled floor 
particular suit stand anything ordinary commercial sets give 
system remember rays short electrical waves 
easiest way stop interpose wave opposite phase cause interference 
fine try get tune unknown wave moving relation center control 
impossible rayed existence 
must use system automatically instantly phase 
hall effect would naturally tend make frequency wave resisting medium change lengthen 
send spherical wave front lengthen rapidly proceeds wave front points different 
entering wave would sooner later meet wave half phase matter motion frequency long lies within comparatively narrow molecular wave band 
apparatus ray screen consists machine generating spherical wave front nature molecular wave great frequency anything 
second part generates condition space opposes wave 
traveling certain distance wave lengthened molecular wave type beyond machine generated longer affects damages 
however proceeds continues lengthen till eventually reaches length infra light air quickly absorbs reaches one absorption bands air molecular waves molecular wave must find half wave complement somewhere wedge waves 
choked energy fighting energy ray screen course 
air however screen greatly helped fact half wave frequency met ray wedge molecular ray buried ions leaving ray screen little work 
job design apparatus form machines make automatically 
tried fun see could make machine need least two humans supervise 
well grinned fuller scientists economic workers two human supervisors make one product right agree 
let see lord morey started door run 
building still trembling shock heavy blow blow seemed much though machine wrecked armored roof big machine 
arcot flying suit already air darting past morey instant streaking vertical shaft would let roof 
molecular ray pistol already hand ready pull beams unfortunate victims pinned 
moment flashed seven stories roof 
gigantic silvery machine rested streamlined perfection hull dazzingly beautiful sunlight 
door opened three tall lean men stepped 
already people collecting ship flying 
air patrolmen floated minute seeing arcot held crowd back 
strange men tall eight feet height 
great round soft brown eyes looked curiosity towering multicolored buildings people floating air green trees blue sky yellowish sun 
arcot looked strangely blotched mottled heads faces arms hands 
feet long narrow legs long thin 
faces kindly mottled skin brown white black seemed make ugly 
disfigurement seemed oddly familiar natural reminiscent way 
lord arcot queer specimens yet seem familiar said morey undertone 

race man first best friend dog see brown eyes typical teeth feet still show traces dog toe step 
nails flat like human ones rounded mottled skin ears look one advancing 
one strangers walked laboriously forward 
lighter world earth evidently home 
great brown eyes fixed arcot arcot watched 
seemed expand grow larger seemed fill sky 
hypnotism concentrated mind eyes suddenly contracted normal eyes stranger 
man reeled back arcot telepathic command sleep came stronger 
stranger friends caught shook slept 
one others looked arcot eyes seemed hurt desperately pleading 
arcot strode forward quickly brought man trance 
shook head smiled arcot desperate difficulty enunciated words english terribly distorted 
ahy wizz tahk 
vokle kohds ron 
tahk breen 
distorted arcot recognized meaning without difficulty 
wish talk 
vocal cords wrong 
talk brain 
switched communication venerian method telepathically without hypnotism 
good enough 
attempted hypnotize known wanted 
necessary hypnotize carry communication method second world system 
brings system system come wish say learned venerian system great difficulty communicating thoughts arcot learned machines would make easier terrestrian invited laboratory crowd steadily growing 
three returned ship moment coming several peculiar headsets 
almost ship started rise going swiftly people cleared way 
tiniest fraction second ship gone shrank point invisible blue vault sky 
apparently intend stay said wade 
trusting souls line retreat cut 
naturally intention harming know 
sure said arcot 
turned apparent leader three explained several stories descend stairs harder flying unit 
wrap arms legs rise hold till feet floor concluded 
stranger walked little closer edge shaft looked 
white bulbs illuminated walls length ground 
man talked rapidly friends looking evident distaste shaft tiny pack arcot back 
finally smiling evinced willingness 
arcot rose man grasped legs rose 
shaft laboratory work moment 
arcot led consultation room number comfortable chairs arranged facing 
seated together friends facing 
friends another world began arcot know errand evidently good reason coming place 
unlikely landing result sheer chance 
brought came point difficult reply 
first must en rapport 
system simple effective depends thought ideas altogether universal 
place heads moment 
must induce temporary hypnotic coma 
let one try first desire 
leader visitors held one several headsets brought caplike things made laminated metal apparently 
arcot hesitated grin slipped 
relax came voice arcot head low droning voice voice command 
sleep added 
arcot felt floating infinite shaft superflying suit pull straps floating lightly 
suddenly reached bottom found surprise led directly room back 
awake 
speak came voice 
arcot shook looked 
new voice spoke tonelessly melodious voice voice individual yet mental voice 
perfectly clear perfectly comprehensible 
traveled far find business utmost import 
ask others let us treat must least possible time 
explain understand 
zezdon fentes first student thought 
sits right zezdon afthen beyond zezdon inthel physics chemistry respectively 
arcot spoke friends 
men something greatest importance tell us seems 
want us hear hurry 
treatment annoying 
try 
man extreme right face zezdon fentes thought zezdon apparently meaning something like professor first student 
next zezdon afthen physics zezdon inthel chemistry 
zezdon afthen offered headsets moment everyone present wearing one 
process putting en rapport took little time shortly able communicate ease 
friends earth must tell strange story quickly benefit world well others 
much annoy 
helpless combat 
world lies far across galaxy even incalculable velocity great swift thing bore us three long months traveled toward distant worlds hoping last invaders might meet masters 
landed roof examined mentally knowledge pilot one patrol ships 
mind told us would find three greatest students science solar system 
came help 
race arisen continued surely determined race call canines 
artificially produced ancient masters hour need come 
lost great science ancient ones 
developed different science science mind 
dogs far psychic men 
would naturally tend develop civilization said arcot judiciously 
chapter iii quarter million light years civilization continued zezdon afthen built largely knowledge mind 
criminals man plots evil surely found thoughts 
lying politicians unjust rulers 
peaceful civilization 
ancient masters feared hated war mighty aversion 
make race cowards merely peaceful intelligence 
must fight homes race fight mightily 
need weapons 
story little race 
tell story civilization ancient ones later time auspicious 
four months ago mental vibration instruments detected powerful emanations space 
could mean new highly intelligent race suddenly appeared within billion miles world 
directional devices quickly spotted emanating third planet system 
zezdon fentes aid set special apparatus would pick strong thoughts make visible 
used see enemy looked upon also saw curious thing eye mind vision past future 
thought amplification device powerful new emanations hard separate 
done finally one man slept 
one enable tune sharply 
could reach time

perfect ease brains tremendously active evil selfishly evil 
nothing benefit counted 
one time instruments went dead feared commander detected us saw happened little later 
second command killed 
saw examine world working way across wearing heavy suits yet terrific gravity world bouncing like rubber balls leaping jumping wanted 
legs would drive like pistons soared air 
tired made examinations slept heavily night 
one night conference 
saw intended

saw ship rise thoughts second command sail space rush toward world 
world grew larger imperfectly sketched know world well 
telescopes great power electric telescopes 
saw investigate planet 
saw plan destroy people found ray follows ray makes parts move one 
could understand could interpret 
thoughts beyond knowledge course meaning even mental amplifiers get bring us 
molecular ray gasped morey surprise 
enemy 
know familiar fight asked zezdon afthen excitedly 
know fight 
much fear replied zezdon afthen 
rate saw intended 
world inhabited would destroy every one men race float great ships settle largest worlds 
stop could 
powerful machines would amplify broadcast thoughts 
broadcast thought waves implanted mind leader would wise land learn extent civilization weapons met 
also ship drew nearer made decide certain spot prepared 
never guessed thoughts 
ideas came seeming spring mind 
landed used one weapon 
thing left one group rulers ancient masters left us care 
never knew never used fifteen thousand years since great masters passed never 
brought concealed behind great piles rock deep canyon ship enemy would land 
landed turned beam machine apparatus rotated swiftly cone beam ray formed beam swung small circle vertical plane 
machine leaped backward though massive tremendous amount labor required bring push pencil force sent hurled back rocky cliff behind though child toy 
continued operate perhaps second perhaps two 
time two great holes cut enemy ship holes fifteen feet across ran completely hull though die cut metal ship cutting disc metal 
terrific concussion roar air blasted ship 
take us long discover enemy dead 
terrible bloated corpses lay everywhere ship 
men able recognize seen mentovisor 
colors distorted forms peculiar 
indeed whole ship seemed strange 
time things ever seem normal strange thing angles seemed machines seem proportion shape twisted trial trip ventured close sun 
arcot whistled softly looked morey 
morey nodded 
probably right 
interrupt 
thought something understood thoughts hopelessly unintelligible 
know explanation asked zezdon afthen eagerly 
think 
ship evidently made world huge size 
men stocky block legs arms entire build desire largest planets would indicate 
world probably even larger forced wear pressure suits even large world could jump said 
huge sphere native world seems gravity would intense distort space 
geometry seems could never developed assume existence straight line absolute plane surface 
things exist space small worlds far central sun mass conditions approach without sufficient discrepency make error obvious 
huge globe world space curved obvious straight line exists plane exists 
geometry would never like 
went close sun attraction sufficient curve space semblance natural conditions home planet senses ship met compromise condition made seem less normal obviously strange 
continue 
arcot looked afthen interestedly 
none left ship careful locating first hole damage propulsive machinery 
second hole accidental due shift machine 
machine wrecked crushed reaction 
forgot pencil force powerful enough wanted would tear machine moorings unless fastened great steel bolts solid rock 
second hole far rear ill luck cut portion driving apparatus 
could repair though succeed last lifting great discs place 
attempted cut put back sections 
finest saws machines nick 
weight unbelievable yet finally succeeded lifting things wall ship 
actual missing material represent tiny cut perhaps wide one credit discs 
could slip thin piece metal much finger 
slots welded tight best steel letting flap hang side cut hot metal cooled drawn shining walls terrific force 
joints perfectly airtight 
machines proper repaired greatest possible extent 
heartbreaking task must guess machines connected together 
much damage done rushing air left filled machines designed resist terrific air pressure pressure ship escaped 
many machines burst open could repair necessary elements knew construction remnants could find unbroken duplicates stock rooms 
connected wrong things 
show dealt 
wrong poles two generators connected together wrong way 
terrific crash switch thrown huge sheets electric flame leaped one 
two men killed incinerated instant even odors one might expect killed flash heat 
everything save shining metal clear glass within ten feet instantly wiped 
fuse link gave 
generator ruined 
one left several small auxiliary generators 
eventually job 
made machine work

investigating system nearly three centuries 
close years ago visited world two hundred years time 
makes year floated around investigating 
done anything arcot asked 
waited auspicious time 
afraid recently visited world utterly amazed find unbelievable progress people made 
intend make immediate attack worlds known intelligently populated 
made mistake letting one race learn much afford let happen 
twenty one inhabited worlds known thousands scouts already investigated nearly central mass universe much outer rings 
established base universe 
know 
alone never mentioned records 
peoples feared world 
one race universe far older sleeping people 
long ago culture decayed 
still far perhaps worth days needed learn 
location take 
world circles dead star laughed morey grimly 
another surprise enemy 
little jog certainly wide awake 
headed big things going lot 
know things ships go planet planet know records enemy said could leave system sun 
alone knew secret 
another surprise said morey 
move faster ship faster 
people dead star moved live star sirius brightest heavens 
much alive new sun 
move faster light also 
little misunderstanding back star passed close 
came second best spoken since 
think make valuable allies 
morey jocular manner realized terrible import announcement 
race able cross vast gulf intergalactic space days terrestrians still developing airplane already mapped jupiter planned colonies developments come molecular rays cosmic rays energy matter else lux relux two artificial metals made solidified light far stronger anything molecular structure nature absolutely infusible totally inert chemically one perfect conductor light radiation space perfect reflector radiations save molecular rays 
made condition reflection action special frequencies formation light molecular frequencies unfortunately able convert perfectly transparent lux metal protective value gone 

earth perhaps 
one race importance others semi civilized 
rated us position races high races dead star world 
science investigated two hundred years ago 
race great distance us greater apparently feared greatly 
cross worlds save small ships driven solely fire thessians called hopelessly inefficient laughably awkward thing ride 
rockets grinned morey 
first ship part rocket 
zezdon fentes smiled 

brought warning plea 
help us answer 
interplanetary council must act 
afraid protect world enemy attacks soon fear 
since base universe impossible believe ships report back home world stated intervals 
one missing soon discovered sought 
war start 
three months took reach us come soon 
men left way back home world came 
call planet friend ortol home replied zezdon inthel 
rate assure world given weapons permit people defend get home within twenty four hours 
ship system waits second satellite fourth planet replied zezdon afthen 
signal tell land beacon intense light alternating red blue reaches point map 
arcot pointed spot vermont private lake laboratory 
turned others rapid fire english explained plans 
need help people much need 
think zezdon fentes stay help 
others go us world 
shall plenty work way going stop mars pick valuable ship make careful examination possible new weapons system speed drive regular space drive 
willing make bet right guess 
regular drive molecular drive lead disintegration apparatus energy cosmic ray absorbers heating drive much like 
speed drive time distortion apparatus wager 
time distinction offers easy solution speed

going hustle workmen installing biggest spare power board get storerooms ancient mariner pack ray screen 
useful 
let move 
ship said zezdon afthen land three hours 
chapter iv first move ortolians standing low green clad hill 
stretched green flank little rise beyond lay ridge ridge broad smooth carpet beautiful vermont hills 
man earth said zezdon afthen turning last wade stood behind 
took us three months constant flight speed unthinkable space dotted titanic gems outer dark stars gleaming red blue orange titanic lighthouses course others dim pinpoints glowing color 
scene unspeakable grandeur awesomely mighty scope one afraid soul shriveled within looked inconceivable masses floating forever alone silence inconceivable nothingness eternal cold eternal darkness 
one awed suppressed sheer magnitude 
magnificent spectacle truly one man could love 
rest tiny pinpoint dust tiny bit tiny corner isolated universe magnitude stillness gone 
chirpings strange birds seek rest darkness soft gurgling little stream rustle countless leaves break silence satisfying existence loneliness great star sun lost tintings soft color fleeciness clouds seeming companionship green hills 
beauty boundless space awe inspiring magnitude 
beauty earth something man love 
man earth home may well fight strength arms forces brain energies space call forth aid 
wondrous world 
silently stood gathering dusk first venus winked one one stars came existence deepening color sky

gazed long heavens world strange beautiful looking unfamiliar heavens star star flashed constellations familiar terrestrians venerians clouds venus eternal shroud 
somewhere space races far beyond power eyes see star sun world around circles little globe home 
happening still exist people still living oh man earth let us reach world quickly guess pangs attack destroyed think forever without home without friends knew 
however kind people may would forever lonely 
think time ship ready think better return replied wade softly english words rousing thoughts mind intelligible ortolians 
three rose air molecular suits drove quickly toward blue gem lake east nestled among still green hills 
lights showing great shop ancient mariner fitted ray shields possible weapons 
men streaming hastily stocking vast quantities foods stocks fuel spare parts could cram stock rooms 
men arrived hilltop work practically done wade stepped morey busily checking list required items 
everything ordered came asked 
yes thanks pull two billion dollar private fortune 
says credit units value expedition never would gotten 
main space distortion power bank new auxiliary coils full 
ten tons lead aboard fuel 
one thing afraid 
enemy system tubes able handle power last tube sunk 
brilliant people suggest using tubes ray power bank forget last tube handle entire output others modulate correctly 
enemy better tube bad us 
morey frankly worried 
end set morey 
soon ready arcot asked 
bout ten fifteen minutes 
morey lit cigarette watched last stuff carried aboard 
last ready 
ancient mariner originally built intergalactic exploration kept working condition 
new apparatus incorporated research led improvements constantly condition ready trip 
many exploration trips nearer stars already made 
ship backed hangar rested great smooth landing field tremendous quarter million ton mass lux relux sinking great smooth depression turf field 
waiting arrival ortolian ship 
zezdon afthen assured would minutes 
high sky came whining whistle approaching ship coming terrific velocity 
came nearer field darting toward ground unheard speed flashing speed well three thousand miles hour last fifty feet slowed sickening deceleration 
even landed crash fully two hundred miles speed 
arcot gasped terrible landing pilot made fully expecting see great hull dent somewhat even though made solid relux 
certainly jar would kill every man board 
yet hull seem harmed crash even ground ship slightly disturbed though distance thirty feet entire block soil crushed cracked terrific impact hundreds thousands tons striking terrific energy 
lord wonder kill 
never saw rotten landing exclaimed morey disgust 
sure 
think landed gently low speed 
notice little soil directly dented replied arcot walking forward 
time control suspected 
ask 
drifted gently 
time rate speeded tremendously hundreds miles per hour us feet per minute 
come get handlers bring junk door coming 
one tall kindly faced canine people standing doorway white light streaming around night casting grotesque shadow landing field flood lights bathing 
zezdon afthen came spoke quickly man evidently command ship 
entire party went ship cream laboratory instruments brought 
hours arcot morey wade worked apparatus ship measuring calculating following electrical magnetic sheer force hook ups staggering complexity 
trying find exact method construction principles involved could perform calculations duplicate results enemy 
thus would far thoroughly familiar machinery done 
little attention paid actual driving plant molecular drive type lead fuel burner used ship 
tubes power bank however puzzle 
made relux impossible see interior tube 
open one destroy calculations made readings instruments showed efficient could readily carry nearly half load best terrestrian tubes could sustain 
meant enemy could send heavier rays heavier ray screens 
finally returned ancient mariner ortolian ship whined way space ancient mariner started rising faster faster atmosphere till night space 
molecular power shut 
ship suddenly seemed writhe space black starless sparkling weirdly distorted stars 
moving already 
almost ortolians fully realized happening dozen stars swung past ship driving better five light years every second 
speed approximately fourteen hours would needed reach ortol 
arcot perhaps explain secret ship said zezdon afthen last turning great lux pilot window arcot seated pilot chair 
know broadest principles intelligible could understand ship captured almost four months study 
yet crept space compared ship 
certainly ship could outdistance race matter fact watch arcot pushed little metal button along slide extreme end 
ship seemed writhe 
space longer black faintly gray beside either side floated two exact replicas ship zezdon afthen stared 
another moment gone space black yet moments grayness showing light appearing growing gradually intensity 
three seconds arcot continued thus pulled metal button slide flicked another pulled cause second change 
stars colors changed beyond recognition speed 
orientation stars behind familiar 
entirely different set constellation showed 
merely opened ship maximum speed moment 
able see large star light years path none 
small stars bother us explain 
put full power main power coils drove ship speed light years second 
turned full power auxiliary coils well doubled power speed multiplied eight 
result four seconds racing made approximately light years zezdon afthen gasped 
two hundred forty light years per second paused bewilderment 
suppose struck small sun dark star even meteor speed would result arcot smiled 
chances excellent plowed one meteor one dark star one small sun 
secret ship attains speed going space 
nothing space attain speed light save radiation 
nothing normal space 
alter space make space along patterns choose distort natural speed radiation enormously greater 
fact change space nothing go slower speed fix 
morey show afthen coils explain 
got stay 
morey rose diving weightless ship went power room zezdon afthen following 
giant pots five feet high close packed rows 
pots contained specially designed coils storing tremendous energy energy four tons disintegrated lead form energy may stored strain distortion space 
charged coils distorted space within making closed field entirely within 
exact gravitational center quarter million ton ship single high coil different design distorted space around well space within 
morey explained control altered constants space suit 
coils charged energy stored 
energy could pumped big coil ship slowed normal space could pumped back 
pumping energy well energy needed recharging coils could supplied three huge power generators 
energy producers morey explained work principle known hundreds years earth 
lead reduced temperature approaching absolute zero closely instance liquid helium electrical resistance 
words matter great current sent resistance heat produced raise temperature 
send powerful current lead wire 
wire current density huge atoms destroyed protons electrons coalesce pure radiant energy 
relux influence magnetic field converts directly electrical potential 
electricity convert spatial strain power coils thus ship driven 
morey pointed huge molecular power cylinder overhead main power drive located inertial center ship near great space coil would permit 
smaller power units vertical lift steering side walls hidden heavy walls relux 
projectors throwing molecular heat rays outside course 
projectors protected 
walls ship made outer wall heavy lux metal vacuum inner wall heavy relux 
lux stronger relux therefore used outer shell 
inner shell relux reflect dangerous rays serve hold heat ship since perfect reflector perfect non radiator 
vacuum wall protect occupants ship undue heat 
get within atmosphere sun would disastrous physical conduction heat permitted though relux turn radiated heat conductor heat would roast almost instantly 
artificial metals absolutely infusible non volatile 
ship actually limb star tremendously hotter sun mine 
see need fear collision small sun meteor like 
since artificial space alone nothing space run 
enter huge sun terrific gravitational field mass matter would enough pull energy coil away us 
actually happened time made first intergalactic exploration 
almost impossible fall large star brilliant 
worrying grinned morey 
ship captured operate asked zezdon afthen 
ingenious system closely related really 
distort space change velocity characteristics words distort rate motion distance characteristics normal space 
thessian ships work principle distorting rate progress time instead space 
velocity really units travel space per unit travel time 
make time unit twice great units traveled space changed velocity twice great 
moving five light years per second make second twice long moving ten light years per double second 
make ten thousand times long traveling fifty thousand light years per ten thousand seconds 
principle drawback 
might increase velocity slowing time passage takes year one heartbeat two years raise arm thus six months turn head body processes slowed way able live tremendous length time though takes two hundred years go one star another low time rate two hundred years seem minutes 
make trip distant star one five light years distant let us say three minutes 
say looking chronometer similarly slowed gone five light years three minutes five thirds light years per minute 
exceeded speed light 
people back earth would say taken two hundred years go five light years therefore gone speed one fortieth light would true time rate 
suppose also speed time 
live year minute two 
everyone else exceedingly slow 
ideal thing would combine two effects arranging space ship rapid time rate ten thousand times normal space 
speed radiation space miles per second speed miles per second would possible still affected though people back home say going far faster light say going miles per second 
imagine ship surrounding space one mile time rate times normal space one hundred feet within ship affected time rate normal due second reversing field 
two fields fight mutually antagonistic merely compound effects 
result agree exceeding speed light understand principle ship operated 
two time fields overlapping time fields 
remember terrible speed ship landed yet appreciable jar according men answer course time rate speeded enough due fact one field completely shut 
principle 
system complex naturally yet learned actual method working process 
must great deal mathematical physical research 
wish done could use mused terrestrian 
weapons none important course molecular ray heat ray

arcot altered ship course shot toward distance city hesthis 
slowing perceptibly yet though city half around world reached half minute 
arcot wizardry controls came play altering space field constants succeeded reaching condition slowed ship almost instantly speed mile second yet without apparent deceleration 
high white ortolian sky shining point bearing visible city 
arcot slanted toward approaching ship grew like expanding rubber balloon

huge flame bright blue shot heavenward roaring heat 
seeing strange ship arrived enough thessians turned drove arcot instantly 
thessian ship built heavy world heavy acceleration consequence found captured ship stronger ancient mariner 
thessians driving arcot acceleration speed convinced dodging useless 
suddenly space black around sunlit world gone 
wonder thought grinned arcot 
wade smiled grimly 
thought counts 
arcot came back normal space time see thessian ship spin quick turn acceleration would crushed human pulp 
pilot dived terrestrian ship

molecular ray reached disappeared flaring ions shield utterly impenetrable ionizing atmosphere 
arcot meanwhile watched instrument shield 
thessian shield would impenetrable shield fed less efficient tubes knew 
already terrific energy thessian ray noticeably heating copper plates tube 
seal would break soon 
another ray reached ray flaring light 
arcot watching eyes telectroscope viewplates saw instant eyes blasted screen went blank 
anything burn eyes muttered terrestrian

another scanner came action viewplate alive 
arcot shot cosmic ray swept thessian thoroughly 
instant needed enemy ship blinded 
immediately ancient mariner dove automatic ray finders could longer hold rays ship 
soon deadly molecular ray shut screen turned molecular rays 
thessian ship ray unable put screen arcot unable use ray enemy ray forcing cover shield 
almost relux covering thessian ship shone characteristic iridescence changed swiftly lux metal 
molecular ray blinked ray screen flashed instead 
thessians covering 
rays useless

dozen rays flaring wildly ship searching blindly sky ground hoping stumble enemy ship ship dived twisted 
arcot busily dodging sweeping rays finally one hit viewplates ship blind 
instantly threw ray screen cutting molecular ray 
cosmics set rotating cones covered three dimensions save city lay 
immediately thessian retreated one segment arcot dare throw rays 
thessian cosmics continued make relux screens necessary ship remained blind 
ray screen showing signs weakening 
thessians got third ray position operation opened

moment morey joined much worried friend 
artificial matter control work ray screens 
thessians never protect moleculars hence destruction wrought 
take screen use deadly weapon 
big outfit might throw screen around whole ship sail right 
stand ten seconds fleet

moved toward creeping behind icy mountains 
magnetic beam reached 
ship lurched fell 
magnetic beam reached toward fort molecular ray flashed already tearing icy waste concealed 
ray screen stopped morey turned magnetic beam time fort 
ray remained arcot retreated hastily 
found secret right 
use morey come called pilot 
evidently put magnetic shielding around apparatus 
means magnetic beam good us 
certainly warn every base install similar protection 
try magnetic ray first attack asked zezdon afthen 
worked sending apparatus would destroyed message could sent call attackers fellsheh 
forcing recall fleet got results get attacking fleet arcot said 
think little stel felso theu 
take shesto make final arrangements till return apparatus capable overthrowing enemies 
wish accompany may 
glanced around others party 
next move return earth 
investigate sirian planets learn anything may interest thence real outer space utter void intergalactic space attempt learn secret enormous power

left earth 
hour hour fled void till last old sol growing swiftly ahead finally earth large screens 
changed straight molecular drive dropped vermont field taken 
long voyage morey arcot spent much time working time distortion field would give tremendous control time either speeding slowing time rate enormously 
last finished worked artificial matter theory point could control shape matter perfectly though yet could control exact nature 
possibility control however definitely proven results machines given 
arcot immediately interested control form 
could control nature opacity transparency vibrations normal matter opaque transparent 
light would pass chose cosmics could stop would radio moleculars stopped present shield could make

attractive ray uncovered secret asked arcot eagerly 
taj lamor men bring attractive ray projector ship 
apparatus turned nearly thousand tons weight twenty feet long ten feet wide approximately twelve feet high 
impossible load huge machine ancient mariner examination conducted spot instruments whose reading intelligible terrestrians operating 
principal fault lay fact despite enormous energy matter given machine still gobbled titanic amounts energy attraction could established large machine needed 
ray long maintained used power actually expended moving planet body 
power used ray action corresponded work done tremendous power needed establish power could never recovered 
reaction produced machine matter body turned upon

practically fault artificial matter world 
see ray actually directed gravitational field 
one thing makes interesting useful 
seems defy laws mechanics 
acts apparent reaction small ship swing world remember field generates attraction integral interwoven part mesh space 
created something outside 
like artificial matter exists alone 
reaction attractive field created space given point reaction taken space 
wonder move 
work considerations fairly obvious 
field built 
takes energy 
beam focused body body falls nearer immediately absorbs energy acquiring velocity 
machine replenishes energy set maintain certain energy level field 
therefore machine must work moving ship though driving apparatus 
beam done wanted may shut energy field available work needed 
may drained back power coils instance one might spend last iota power job 
driving device might set pull entire ship along still acceleration detectable occupants 
think use big ship finished eyes far away future idea 
natural gravity natural matter luckily selective 
goes directions 
artificial gravity controlled spread result mass attraction mass matter fall inverse square distance like ray parallel beam spotlight continues undiminished 
actually create exceedingly intense exceedingly small gravitational field direct straight line 
building field takes time 
zezdon afthen question troubling looked anxiously friends 
finally broke thoughts cryptically abbreviated follow like work professor solving problem steps taken swiftly abbreviated following impossible students 
machine moved exerting force body asked last 
oh ray concentrates gravitational force projects 
actual strain space 
space takes strain normal cases unless masses large considerable acceleration produced great distance 
law operates case pulled body pulls gravitational field normal field inverse square law applying 
hand gravity beam pulls constant force 
might likened light pressure effects spotlight star 
spotlight would push sun force constant matter distance light pressure sun would vary inverse square distance 
remember body pulls another body gravitational field pulls another 
field space 
normal field necessarily attached matter represents represents prefer artificial field connection form matter 
product machine exists strain space 
move must move space since like artificial matter exists created space 
see law action reaction apparently flouted actually reaction taken space

however arcot could make known kind matter many unknown kinds 
came greatest problem 
ready start work data collected space 
asked zezdon afthen watched three terrestrians begin work nature thing attempting harness word energy replied arcot pausing 
attempting harness energy primeval form form space field 
remember mass measure energy 
two centuries ago scientist world proposed idea energy could measured mass proceeded prove relationship firmly intrenched formula e mc 
sun giving energy 
giving mass form light photons 
field sun gravity must constantly decreasing mass decreases 
collapsing field 
true sun gravitational field decrease minute amount despite fact sun loses thousand million tons matter every four minutes 
percentage change minute energy released immeasurable 
going invent new power unit afthen 
call sol power sun 
one sol rating sun 
measure energy use terms sun powers horsepower 
may tell magnitude zezdon afthen asked men earth work problem us problems save problem fate world still fifty thousand years time future

finally last equation time artificial matter awful weapons unlimited cosmic power calculated fell last stage work 
actual appliances designed 
completed apparatus ortolian talsonian working carefully investigated terrestrial physicists mechanism studied 
arcot great plans incorporated control apparatus 
one remaining problem exact location time 
already progress brought well nineteenth century morey sadly remarked tell date sadly lacking history 
known real date instance famous battle bull run could watched telectroscope determined time

historians bunch first class kitchen mechanics 
looks like due another landing locate exact date agreed arcot 
land let wait nearer time belong watch carefully long suggested wade 
argued question two hundred years matter fact 
academic anyway 
chapter xvi home getting near time arcot felt 
indeed must already exist earth 
one thing puzzles commented would happen go see 
either want pointed morey think answer nothing exist two times time rate said arcot 
long different time rate could exist two times 
tried exist simultaneously could forced slip time time wherein either exist wherein yet 
since nearer time last existed normal time time birth went time left 
suspect find left earth 
shall investigate absolutely arcot hoping overshoot mark much 
morey intimated gone much beyond time left earth might find conditions serious indeed 
went toward earth time control 
neared looked anxiously signs invasion 
arcot spotted evident signs however two large spheres tiny points appearance telectroscope screen circling earth one miles moving east west miles moving north south 
seems enemy retreated space fighting 
wonder long away 
swept speed greater light invisible till arcot slowed near atmosphere 
instantly half dozen fast ships darted toward ship evidently unlike thessian ships attack made 
first occupants would opportunity prove friendliness 
terrestrians arcot morey wade reporting back exploration space two friends

vermont 
yes sir

thanks message thus sent ahead less half hour landed vermont field started 
group scientists last call gone seemed natural enough working three months interval trip dr arcot senior saw misfortune 
never get straight ready expect back till next week 
men gone back laboratories since permits better work part call half hour 
sure want come 
learn son done calculating data yet learned plenty feel quite sure hint would bring learning hounds around us pretty quickly dad laughed arcot junior believe calculating stuff three months since left yesterday yes true time field turned space control thessian ship picked moment run us 
cut ship half neatly please threw us eighty thousand years past 
coasting time retarded rate earth caught speak 
meantime three months day call men 
let come appointment work plenty work assure 
list things order standard supply houses think better get us dad 
arcot manner became serious 
gotten government expense research cards yet 
order stuff get get ready 
honestly believe ships apparatus permit enough job 
really pity men opportunity crowding much work little time want take road concentration enemy amused absence come let sit house instead standing sun 
started toward house arcot senior explained happened short time away
