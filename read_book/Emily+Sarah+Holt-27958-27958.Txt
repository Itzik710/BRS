mean child joan verily child mine heart 
soul yearns sister though help thought queen isabel unjust dealing mother 
may good lord forgive sin know deep gray eyes long black lashes stirred mine heart strangely first came hither eyes lost love 
knew known eyes aforetime seemed long long ago though another world 
much hath joan told hear sets man worthy best love good woman heart mine heart wrong enduring love 
coming think seeing dimly mist love sin neither disgrace even heart maid devoted unto god 
knoweth put first take ordering life holy best lot shall glory mine true welfare 
say openly unto likely misconceive 
whose pure devoted souls things indifferent pure shall see god 
man saith world also unto whose vile corrupt hearts things indifferent impure maybe world times even cloister 
feel might misread meaning take ill advantage thereof keep thoughts god 
never ask joan one question touching treasure every bye note uttereth 
yet know seems love tell 
reason hath loved heart hath eyes see mine much doth joan say mother think names others 
methinks see good woman women go go ill little surface cleverness reckoned run deeper inclined despise lord reason wit lay came glittering bubbles top 
dare reckon looked well bodily comforts better wife might likely better poor alianora la despenser would made god ordered thus 
methinks hear hath passed behind jasper walls pray god may meet 
wed given marriage equal unto angels surely angels love 
strange talk joan held yesterday 
marvel may portend 
says late years many priests put forth writings wherein say church greatly fallen away verity scripture ages good men said case blessed robert de grosteste bishop lincoln two hundred years gone holy thomas de bradwardine archbishop canterbury richard rolle hermit hampole whose holy meditations psalter library oft read therein stir though reforming church arise bishop grosteste earnestly desire 
joan says lord earnest new opinions eager promote saith church matters politic men sleep nap season slow decay goes apace wake set work mend matters 
reign present king saith world church long nap awake looking round see matters dust ivy lack cleansing away 
divers clerks laymen thus bestirring foremost lord lancaster king son john gaunt among lay folk among clergy one father wycliffe note head college oxenford rector lutterworth leicestershire 
saith father wycliffe things thus gone corruption reason lack salt preservative found holy scripture 
many years back king alfred forefather set forth much said scriptures english tongue much indeed time death hindered else holy hooks rendered english tongue 
reason years english day gone clean mind man understand great need another rendering man may understand 
father wycliffe hopes effect god grant grace 
truly marvellous strange notions hath 
joan says would fain away endowing church saying lord apostles provision reason right hardness men hearts surely holy women ministered substance well ill 
moreover would monkery done away yea clean realm hath mighty hard names monks especially mendicant friars yet nuns never heard speak unkindly word 
strange matter good sooth nearly takes away breath hear tell 
saith pope right power realm england church england hath alway held bishop grosteste fervently abhor pope power egyptian bondage word 
much father also say simony would private confession priest verily would gladly see abolished indulgences letters fraternity pilgrimages guilds sets face new fashion singing mass intoning new invention use incense churches 
strangest hear inveighing doctrine church sacred host god body 
saith figure christ body eaten men save ghostly morally 
eat christ ghostly mind kindly suffered man ghostly meat soul 
arnold english works wycliffe volume pages 
new doctrine yet father wycliffe hear saith old doctrine apostles contrary new never saith heard time one radbert first set forth five hundred years ago slumbered condemned holy doctors till year lord god pope forced church 
strange matter know think 
joan says new doctrine priests go father wycliffe even cast doubt purgatory worship word merely meant honor lady 
ah prove god word purgatory would chant many thanksgivings thereon years knew lost love dead alive thought dread awful land darkness sorrow yet knowing could masses sung able could never told asked father mother christian souls offered mine communion intention thereto 
ay many time dare confess offered intent god commanded dead knowing god knew humbly trusting mercy ill 
worship lady passing strange specially religious woman 
always taught blessing woman might carry griefs sorrows seeing god man like enter woman feelings 
priests say almost afraid write dishonouring christ died us therefore must needs full tenderness died need man woman even mother stand betwixt 
lord years dishonouring thee setting another even though thy blessed mother thee yet surely regardeth honor full diligently said saint john behold thy mother doth apostle represent whole church thereby commanded regard righteous man mother teaching church rome 
remember blessed hermit hampole scarcely makes mention christ book 
joan ensures word god whereof hath read books missed verily know think 
lord thou wist error save therefrom 
thou wist truth guide therein would seem erred offering communions 
eat christ body mind according word hoc facite meam commemorationem offering sacrifice holy mass joan says saint paul epistle hebrews saith hallowed oblation body jesus christ remission oblation sin 
truly need pray lord guide us thy truth yet lord keep us therein must think hereon 
sooth rises great barrier new doctrine lay joan quickly sun break forth melt spoonful snow clear away word saint paul 
epistles right tongue end 
instance quoth christ said bestow holy spirit lead church truth 
church err church said boldly 
church righteous men hold christ words pope cardinals like 
last right hold first bondage 
said father benedict told saint paul bade religious obey superiors much men obey church marvel saith father benedict found 
never word says paul touching religious persons none day 
religious paul day cried never much one saith monk nun friar pareshull told much great man among us 
saint peter bids clergy dominate inferiors saint paul says ephesians speaking clergy arise heretics speaking perversely saint john says believe every spirit prove spirits god 
dear mother annora nowhere bidden scripture obey church save concerns settling dispute betwixt two members 
obey church church 
father rolle taught much holy kirk quoth ilk righteous man soul 
verily churches empowered christ make laws people must church england obey laws made bishop rome therein said fully hold thee 
things said earnestly let us hold god law take interpretation men straight god 
lo promise holy ghost assured unto church one followeth christ 
keep words indwelt spirit dear mother church god truth promised 
said nought knew answer 
yet another thing saith joan dropping voice low 
god church contradicts god word david saith things thou hast magnified thy name note heard wise man could read ancient volumes dead tongues saint hierome set true words namely thy name thou hast magnified thy word 
god hath set word name highest part dare assemblage men gainsay indulgences licences sin popes set forth suffering wed god forbidden forbidding priests god suffered surely thing god points teaching doctrines commandments men 
joan said dear heart lord say whatsoever ye shall bind earth shall bound heaven surely authorises church 
contrary unto god word may give leave within limits word trow contrary thereto 
king giveth plenipotentiary powers keeper great seal deposing superseding reckon among 
things subject unto christ saith paul doubtless excepting subject things unto 
god give power loosing binding church meant shall bind thus endowed contrary law 
answered nought little 
last said joan word troubles religious folks always quoting 
man hate father mother forth lord disciple 
think heard one another every week since came 
say new doctrine folks means old doctrines mother dear saith old apostles christ 
means go forth end see means hate soul also 
kill go wilfully perdition nay mean even dearest worthiest loves set worthier love glory god lord never meant religious person neglect father mother plainly seen another word wherein rebukes priests day taught man might bestow oblation god father mother need demanded 
reproves rejected command god order keep tradition 
see therefore church doth ratified heaven 
said minute thought bidden hate relations hate one god loveth answered 
hate selfishness hate 
sat silent setting red eyes golden claws green wyvern joan ran white dots along griffin tail 
came fork tail laid brush 
mother saith dear gray eyes looking face shall read together holy scripture beseech god lead us truth dear child said joan didst thou ever read holy scripture wicked kiss folks smiled 
read one saith stole behind holiest men ever breathed kissed feet rebuke many sins forgiven loved much 
full sinful woman might kiss christ without rebuke methinks please mother dear might kiss
