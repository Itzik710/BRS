utmost aim rough sketch coming time prospectus joint undertaking mankind facing impending years 
reader prospective shareholder heirs though whether find anticipatory balance sheet belief liking another matter 
reasons develop clearly papers unfold extremely convenient begin speculation upon probable developments changes means land locomotion coming decades 
one studied civil history nineteenth century deny far reaching consequences changes transit may one studied military performances general buller general de wet see upon transport upon locomotion may also hang momentous issues politics war 
growth great cities rapid populating america entry china field european politics example quite obviously directly consequences new methods locomotion 
much hangs upon development methods development hand process comparatively independent rate great movements affected 
depends upon sequence ideas arising experiments made upon laws political economy almost inevitable natural laws 
great issues supposing possible return western europe roman communion overthrow british empire germany inundation europe yellow peril might conceivably affect details let us say door handles ventilators mileage line would probably leave essential features evolution locomotion untouched 
evolution locomotion purely historical relation western european peoples 
longer dependent upon exclusively hands 
malay nowadays sets upon pilgrimage mecca excursion steamship iron immemorial hindoo goes shopping train japan australasia america plentiful hands minds take process even european let fall 
beginning twentieth century happens coincide interesting phase great development means land transit distinctive feature speaking materially nineteenth century 
nineteenth century takes place centuries chronological charts future needs symbol almost inevitably symbol steam engine running upon railway 
period covers first experiments first great developments complete elaboration mode transit determination nearly broad features century history may traced directly indirectly process 
since interesting light thrown upon new phases land locomotion beginning well begin forecast retrospect revise shortly history addition steam travel resources mankind 
curious profitable question arises 
steam locomotive appeared time earlier history world invented 
invented want crowning intellect none many minds concerned development strikes one mind newton shakespeare darwin strikes one unprecedented man 
need railway steam engine arisen use one egregiously wrong misleading phrases ever dropped lips man demand created supply quite way 
really urgent demand things time current needs european world seem fairly well served coach diligence hand every administrator intelligence roman chinese empires must felt urgent need rapid methods transit disposal 
development steam locomotive result sudden discovery steam 
steam something mechanical possibilities steam known two thousand years used pumping water opening doors working toys christian era 
may urged advance outcome new systematic handling knowledge initiated lord bacon sustained royal society appear case though doubt new habits mind spread outward center played part 
men whose names cardinal history development invented part quite empirical way trevithick engine running along rails evan boat walloping hudson quarter century carnot expounded general proposition 
deductions principles application occur story electricity justify attribution steam engine scientific impulse 
particular invention seem directly due new possibilities reducing shaping casting iron afforded substitution coal wood iron works greater temperature afforded coal fire 
china coal used reduction iron many centuries 
doubt new facilities greatly help steam engine invasion field common life quite certainly sufficient set going 
indeed one cause complex unprecedented series causes set steam locomotive going 
indirectly another way introduction coal became decisive factor 
one peculiar condition production england seems supplied one ingredient missing two thousand years group conditions necessary steam locomotive could appear 
missing ingredient demand comparatively simple profitable machine upon elementary principles steam utilization could worked 
one studies stephenson rocket detail one realizes profound complexity one begins understand impossible would structure come existence de novo however urgently world need 
happened coal needed replace dwindling forests small exceptionally rain saturated country occurs low hollow basins overlying clay china alleghanies example high lying outcrops worked chalk worked england 
fact followed quite unprecedented pumping appliances became necessary thoughts practical men turned thereby long neglected possibilities steam 
wind extremely inconvenient purpose pumping latitudes inconstant costly time labourers might obliged sit pit mouth weeks together whistling gale waiting water got 
steam already used pumping upon one two estates england rather toy earnest middle seventeenth century attempt employ obvious practically unavoidable 
water trickling coal measures acted therefore like water trickling upon chemicals long mixed together dry inert 
immediately latent reactions set going 
savery newcomen host workers culminating watt working always steps least nearly obvious give rise simultaneous discoveries changed toy steam real commercial thing developed trade pumping engines created foundries new art engineering almost unconscious made steam locomotive well nigh unavoidable consequence 
last century improvement pumping engines remained nothing obvious stage getting engine developed wheels upon ways world 
ever eighteenth century engine would put upon roads pronounced failure one monstrous pal oferric creature visible french high road early dawn nineteenth century problem nearly got solved 
trevithick steam locomotive indisputably motion almost financially possible hands puffed way slowly first stephenson faster faster transitory empire earth 
steam locomotive primarily steam engine pumping adapted new end steam engine whose ancestral stage developed conditions means exacting matter weight 
fact followed consequence hampered railway travel transport greatly tolerated nowadays belief practical necessity 
steam locomotive huge heavy high road put upon rails 
clearly linked steam engines railways minds common language latter implies former 
indeed result accidental impediments avoidable difficulties travel day rails 
railway traveling best compromise 
quite conceivable ideal locomotive convenience far travellers concerned surely highly mobile conveyance capable traveling easily swiftly desired point traversing reasonably controlled pace ordinary roads streets access higher rates speed long distance traveling specialized ways restricted swift traffic possibly furnished guide rails 
collection delivery sorts perishable goods also system obviously altogether superior existing methods 
moreover system would admit secular progress engines vehicles stereotyped conditions railway almost completely arrested would allow almost new pattern put upon ways without interference established traffic 
ideal kept view first traveller would able get long distance journeys pace seventy miles hour without changing without trouble waiting expense delay arises household hotel actual rail 
ideal must least possible intelligent person fifty years ago resolutely pursued world instead fumbling compromise compromise always done probably many centuries yet might provided day infinitely practicable method communication one capable steady continual evolution year year 
obvious path development one immediately cheaper along path went short sighted nineteenth century progress quite heedless possibility ending cul de sac 
first locomotives apart heavy tradition ancestry like experimental machinery needlessly clumsy heavy inventors men insufficient faith instead working lightness smoothness motion took easier course placing upon tramways already existence chiefly transit heavy goods soft roads 
followed interesting curious result 
tram lines naturally exactly width ordinary cart width prescribed strength one horse 
people saw locomotive anything cheap substitute horseflesh found anything incongruous letting dimensions horse determine dimensions engine 
mattered nothing first passenger ridiculously cramped hampered crowded carriage 
always cramped coach would seemed utopian dreadful thing indeed grandparents propose travel without cramping 
mere inertia horse cart gauge ft 
gauge nemine contradicente established world everywhere train dwarfed scale limits alike comfort power speed 
every engine trots ghost superseded horse refuses resolutely trot faster fifty miles hour shies threatens catastrophe every point curve 
fifty miles hour authorities agreed limit speed land travel far existing conditions go 
revolutionary reconstruction railways development new competing method land travel carry us beyond 
people day take railways granted take sea sky born railway world expect die one 
strip eyes blinding influences acquiescence familiar see clearly enough vast elaborate railway system whole world linked together really vast system trains horse waggons coaches drawn along rails pumping engines upon wheels 
spite present vast extension likely remain predominant method land locomotion even short period next hundred years much capital represented existing type railways firm establishment acquiescence men doubtful railways ever attempt fundamental change direction greater speed facility unless first exposed pressure second alternative competition may well go inquire long second alternative comes operation ever 
let us consider possibilities seem offer 
let us revert ideal already laid consider hopes obstacles attainment seem 
abounding presence numerous experimental motors day stimulating imagination many stimulated persons work upon difficult believe obvious impossibility convulsiveness clumsiness many cases exasperating trail stench rapidly fined away 
think asking much reader faith progress assume far light powerful engine goes comparatively noiseless smooth running obnoxious sensitive nostrils altogether suitable high road traffic problem speedily solved 
upon assumption direction new motor vehicles likely develop react upon railways finally take us present seem promise developments upon three distinct definite lines 
first motor truck heavy traffic 
already trucks evidence distributing goods parcels various sorts 
sooner later doubt numerous advantages arrangement lead organization large carrier companies using motor trucks carry goods bulk parcels high roads 
companies exceptionally favourable position organize storage repair motors general public profitable terms possibly co operate various ways manufactures special types motor machines 
next place parallel motor truck develop hired privately owned motor carriage 
except longest journeys add fine sense personal independence small conveniences first class railway travel 
capable day journey three hundred miles long developments presently foreshadowed arrive 
one change nothing unless driver stage stage 
one free dine one chooses hurry one chooses travel asleep awake stop pick flowers turn bed morning tell carriage wait unless highly probable one sleeps aboard 
thirdly motor omnibus attacking developing horse omnibus companies suburban lines 
seems fairly safe prophesying 
things quite obviously coming even working many structural problems next phase development begins 
motor omnibus companies competing suburban railways find hampered speed longer runs slower horse traffic routes attempt secure may tough legislative struggles secure power form private roads new sort upon vehicles free travel limit highest possible speed 
along line private tracks roads forces change certainly tend travel along absolutely convinced travel 
segregation motor traffic probably matter may begin even present decade 
process segregation high road horse pedestrian sets probably go rapidly 
may spread short omnibus routes much london metropolitan railway system spread 
motor carrier companies competing speed delivery quickened railways conceivably co operate long distance omnibus hired carriage companies formation trunk lines 
almost insensibly certain highly profitable longer routes joined london brighton example england 
quiet english citizen doubt things still quite exceptional experimental lagging land read one day surprise violently illustrated popular magazines many thousand miles roads already established america germany elsewhere 
thereupon patriotic meditations may pull together 
may even hazard details special roads 
example different macadamized roads used soft tired conveyances battering horseshoes perpetual filth horse traffic clumsy wheels laden carts never wear 
may surface like cycle racing tracks though since open wind weather perhaps probable made good asphalt sloped drain still probable quite new substance altogether whether hard resilient beyond foretelling 
wide wide courage promoters goes first made narrow question gauge limit later ones 
traffic opposite directions probably strictly separated doubt habitually disregard complicated fussy regulations imposed initiative railway interest official bodies board trade 
promoters doubtless take hint suburban railway traffic current difficulty metropolitan police ways branch streams traffic cross level bridges 
easily conceivable tracks existence cyclists motors constructing companies able make use 
moreover exist possible experiment vehicles size power quite beyond dimensions prescribed ordinary roads roads whose width entirely determined size cart horse pull 
countless modifying influences course come operation 
example assumed perhaps rashly railway influence certainly remain jealous hostile growths may called bicycle ticket policy pursued throughout 
assuredly fights complicated sort first one specialized lines operation may least railway companies hasten replace flanged rolling stock carriages rubber tyres remove rails broaden cuttings embankments raise bridges take new ways traffic 
may find answer cut fares widen gauges reduce gradients modify points curves woo passenger back carriages beautifully hung sumptuously furnished convenience luxury club 
people would mind hour longer going paris london railway traveling neither rackety cramped tedious 
one could patient enough one neither jarred deafened cut slices draughts continually densely caked filthy dust coal one could write smoothly easily steady table read papers one hair cut dine comfort none things possible present none require new inventions revolutionary contrivances indeed anything intelligent application existing resources known principles 
rage fast trains far long distance travel concerned largely passion end extreme discomfort involved 
daily journey suburban train daily tax time speed eminently desirable conditions railway travel hopelessly fail 
must always remembered railway train motor advantage wholesale traction reduces prime cost demanding one engine great number coaches 
serve first class long distance passenger may third 
economy one must balance necessary delay relatively infrequent service latter item becomes relatively greater greater proportion former briefer journey made 
may many railways neither capable modification suburban motor tracks development luxurious routes find spite loss many elements old activity still profit made certain section heavy goods traffic cheap excursions 
forms work railways seem particularly adapted diversion great portion passenger traffic would enable conduct even efficiently 
difficult imagine example sort road car organization could beat railways business distributing coal timber similar goods taken bulk directly pit wharf local centres distribution 
must always remembered worst defeat great organization railway system involve disappearance long period elapsed 
means first period modification differentiation 
extinction happen certain amount wealth railway property must absolutely disappear 
though stress successful competition capital value railways may conceivably fall continue fall towards marine store prices fares freights pursue sweated working expenses vanishing point land occupied sink level eligible building sites yet railways nevertheless continue operation downward limits positively attained 
imagination prone picturesque insists stage upon vision latter days one less happily situated lines 
along weedy embankment pants clangs patched tarnished engine paint blistered parts leprously dull 
driven aged sweated driver burning garbage furnace distils choking reek air 
huge train urban dust trucks bangs clatters behind en route sequestered dumping ground rubbish burnt industrial end 
lapse merely possible local tragedy 
almost certainly existing lines railway develop differentiate one direction another according nature pressure upon 
almost probably still existence divers ways busy spite swarming new highways ventured foreshadow hundred years 
fact contemplate much supersession railways modification specialization various directions enormous development beside competing supplementary methods

business chapter discuss relation social order available means transit attempt deduce principles elucidated coming phases extraordinary expansion shifting internal redistribution population conspicuous last hundred years 
let us consider broad features redistribution population characterized nineteenth century 
may summarized unusual growth great cities slight tendency depopulation country 
growth great cities essential phenomenon 
aggregates populations eight hundred thousand upward four five millions certainly far world outside limits chinese empire goes entirely unprecedented thing 
never outside valleys three great chinese rivers city exception rome perhaps doubtfully babylon certainly million inhabitants least permissible doubt whether population rome spite exacting tribute sea borne food whole mediterranean basin exceeded million great length time

call towns cities indeed different order things towns cities eighteenth century world 
concurrently aggregation people new sort center alleged depletion country villages small townships 
far counting heads goes depletion nearly marked growth great towns 
relatively however striking enough 
growth large towns really one may allege result development railways world simply change human circumstances happens arisen time needs general review conditions distribution population realize former probably true answer 
convenient make issue part general proposition namely general distribution population country must always directly dependent transport facilities 
illustrate point roughly may build imaginary simple community considering needs 
arable country side example inhabited people attained level agricultural civilization war longer constantly imminent population would diffused primarily families groups farmsteads 
might simple population almost distributed 
even simplest agriculturists find certain convenience trade

meeting place certain distance particular farm would inconvenient farmer get produce back business comfortable daylight 
would able come instead would either go nearer center trade gossip neighbors failing go 
evidently would maximum distance places 
distance england traffic mainly horse traffic many centuries seems worked according gradients forth eight fifteen miles distances find country towns horseless man serf labourer laboring wench marked narrow limits distribution intervening villages 
chance gathering places arisen points much closer maximum come competition one finally got better england distribution often singularly uniform 
agricultural districts towns eight miles grazing takes place plough town distances increase fifteen 
entirely multiple horse foot strides villages towns world country side plotted 
third almost final factor determining town distribution world without railways would seaport navigable river 
ports would grow dimensions dependent population conveniently accessible coasts river banks quality quantity products near ports conveniences civilization increased would appear handicraft towns largest possible towns foot horse civilization industries nature produce coasts required 
always connection port navigable river greater towns pre railway periods arose day journey away coast sea attack probable shifting coast ceased threaten

commercial natural towns determined political centres also finally chosen strategic considerations word communications 
perhaps real significance previous paper sea velocities fifty miles hour land travel rate hundred even cab omnibus journeys thirty forty miles shown possible becomes apparent

picture swarming concentrated humanity effective possibilities unhappily instead obvious rule three sum one resorts analysis operating causes plausibility crumbles away gives place altogether different forecast forecast indeed almost violent contrast first anticipation

already limit exceeded day brings us nearer time thrust outward every direction effect enormous relief 
far additions foot horse old dispensation actually come operation suburban railways render possible average door office hour journey ten dozen miles case specially favored localities 
star shaped contor modern great city thrusting arms along every available railway line knotted arms every knot marks station testify sufficiently relief pressure thus afforded 
great towns century presented rounded contors grew puff ball swells modern great city looks like something burst intolerable envelope splashed 
previous paper sought make clear suburban railways mere first rough expedient far convenient rapid developments 
census returns quite clearly show early phase great development centrifugal possibilities 
since shown city pedestrians inexorably limited radius four miles horse using city may grow seven eight follows available area city offer cheap suburban journey thirty miles hour circle radius thirty miles 
much therefore view adduced previous paper expect available area even common daily toilers great city year earlier radius much larger even circle radius thirty miles gives area square miles almost quarter belgium 
thirty miles moderate estimate speed reader former paper agree think available area social equivalent favored season ticket holders day radius one hundred miles almost equal area ireland 
radius sweep area available live outer suburbs include still vaster area 
indeed much say london citizen year ad may choice nearly england wales south nottingham east exeter suburb vast stretch country washington albany available active citizen new york philadelphia date 
moment imply cities density existing great cities spread limits 
even suppose increase populations great cities go present rate enormous extension available area would still mean great possibility diffusion 
though great cities probably still far maxima though network feeding railways still spread africa china though huge areas still imperfectly productive want cultivating population yet well remember great city quite irrespective available spaces maximum population fixed 
great city sustained finally trade production certain proportion world surface area commands commercially 
great city grow except result quite morbid transitory process cured last famine disorder beyond limit commercial capacity commanded area prescribes 
long population city inner circle third area belgium rose towards old fashioned city density restriction would come 
even allowed considerable increase production food stuffs future still remains inevitable increase city world must come last upon arrest 
yet though one may find reasons anticipating city end overtake surpass one like relative prophesying difficult find data infer absolute numerical limits various diffused cities 
perhaps seemly admit data occurred writer 
far london st petersburg berlin go seems fairly safe assume go well twenty millions new york philadelphia chicago probably hankow almost certainly reach forty millions 
yet even forty millions thirty one thousand square miles territory comparison four millions fifty square miles highly diffused population 
far possible diffusion accomplish let us first consider case classes free exercise choice matter shall better position consider numerous classes whose general circumstances practically dictated
