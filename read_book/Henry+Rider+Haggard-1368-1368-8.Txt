note j r bickley mrcs world shook chapter arbuthnot describes suppose humphrey arbuthnot begin history destiny caused play prominent part short account circumstances 
born forty years ago devonshire village write house 
live priory ancient place fine one way panelled rooms beautiful gardens mild climate addition flourish many plants one would expect find countries lie nearer sun green undulating park studded great timber trees 
view perfect behind around rich devonshire landscape hills valleys scarped faces red sandstone distance front sea 
little towns quite near live part visitors hidden away contors ground priory one see 
fulcombe live though obvious reasons give real name 
many years ago father rev humphrey arbuthnot whose child also named humphrey vicar place family said rather vague hereditary connection 
severed carolian times ancestors fought side parliament 
father recluse widower mother scotswoman died shortly birth 
high church days popular family owned priory 
indeed head somewhat vulgar person name enfield made money trade almost persecuted position local magnate owner rectorial tithes 
mention fact owing boy made mind one day would buy place sit seat wild enough idea time 
yet became engrained aspirations youth opportunity arose years carried 
poor old enfield fell evil fortunes trying bolster favorite son gambler spendthrift ungrateful scamp end practically ruined bad times came forced sell fulcombe estate 
think kindly good gave many day shooting leave fish trout river 
poor people however district round parish small father much beloved although practice confession wear vestments set lighted candles altar even said openly expressed wish however never attained could see censer swinging chancel 
indeed church monks built large fine always full sundays though many worshippers came far away doubtless curiosity papistical repute also learned fashion father preaching good indeed 
part feel owe much high church views 
opened certain doors taught something mysteries lie back religions therefore home inspired soul man whence religions born 
pity ninety nine cases hundred never discovers never even guesses entombed aspiration never sinks shaft secret precious vein ore 
said father learned mild description never know anyone quite learned 
one men good round became pre eminent nothing 
classic first water respectable mathematician expert theology student sundry foreign languages literature lighter moments inquirer sociology theoretical musician though playing organ excruciated people correct really first class authority upon flint instruments best grower garden vegetables county also apples attainments 
made sermons popular since times one subjects would break theory god spoke us things 
began drift analysis father abilities never stop 
would take book describe 
yet mark name dead world day though never 
light reflected hundred facets dissipates space lost concentrated one tremendous ray pierces stars 
going frank without frankness value record becomes simply another convention rather conventional method expressing octoroon kind truths highly civilised races feed fastidious ladies eat cakes bread smallest particle nourishment extracted 
fact therefore inherited father abilities except love flint instruments always bored distraction although association really human things somehow never convey idea humanity 
addition practical side lacked possessed surely must become archbishop instead dying vicar unknown parish 
also spiritual sense mayhap mystical would better term religion missing father nature 
think notwithstanding charity devotion never quite got away shell things never cracked set teeth kernel alone feed souls 
keen intellect take example recognized every one difficulties faith flashed hither thither darkness seeking explanation seeking light trying reconcile explain 
great enough put aside go straight informing soul beneath strives express everywhere even husks called world flesh devil yet always quite succeed 
boggling exteriors peering pitfalls desire prove senses tell us impossible fact possible causes overthrow many earnest seeking heart renders work conducted false lines quite nugatory 
trust intelligence content spring cliffs human experience everlasting arms infinite stretched receive give rest keys knowledge 
man learn taught old faith plank wherewith float upon sea miserable works avail nothing also plank made many sorts wood perhaps suit different weights honest sense believe father superior know agreed 
perhaps owing blood scotch mother mixed well perhaps essential spirit given though cast mould fact quite different another alloy 
wonder really understand millions billions alloys many indeed nature whatever behind nature never uses twice two human beings ever quite identical 
flesh body humiliation identical chemist prove animates flesh distinct different comes home infinite variety necessary ultimate evolution good bad symbolise heaven hell 
certain extent still another advantage father certainly came mother judge descriptions likenesses remain extremely handsome woman 
born much better looking 
small dark little man deep set eyes beetling brows 
also dark tall average well made 
know need say personal appearance attractive subject fact remains called handsome humphrey university captain college boat many prizes athletic sports time train 
went oxford father educated partly knew could better anyone else partly save school expenses 
experiment successful love outdoor sports small hazardous adventure came hand also associating fisherfolk dangers deep make men among men saved becoming milksop 
rest learned father always desired please loved done best costly schools 
shown last went college scholarship well indeed search would still reveal 
better set shortcomings sum made failure 
yes failure highest sense though trust stevenson calls faithful failure 
root fastidiousness lack perseverance really means lack faith using word higher wider sense 
one real faith one would always persevere knowing every work undertaken high aim element nobility however humble unrecognised work may seem 
god god work written large upon face universe 
expand upon thought would lead far afield understanding know mean 
regards interpret fastidiousness easy express 
perhaps definition help 
like man developed sense smell walking foreign city however clean well kept always catch evil savors inseparable cities 
keen perception interferes perceptions spoils walks 
result years whenever thinks beautiful city remembers historic buildings wide boulevards whatever boast rather ancient fish like smell 
least remembers first owing defect temperament 
everything 
lovely woman spoiled one eats much high voice care shooting scenery flat fishing gnats bite well trout 
short tune world 
moreover quality exists overcome affects day labourers well gentlemen large 
bred bone 
probably second failure breeding fault lack perseverance roots first rate case 
least leaving college reputation called bar owing certain solicitor connections good opening 
also owing excellence memory powers work began well making money even first year 
happened certain case came way leader falling ill suddenly opened left hands 
man whose cause pleading think one biggest scoundrels possible conceive 
case effect would beggar two estimable middle aged women justly entitled property end personally convinced committed forgery perjury accompanied even mention 
well win thanks estimable middle aged ladies beggared heard afterwards driven extremities one died misery became lodging house keeper 
details matter may explain ladies unattractive appearance manner broke beneath cross examination made appear telling falsehoods whereas completely confused 
invented ingenious theory facts although judge regarded suspicion convinced unusually stupid jury gave verdict 
everybody congratulated time triumphant especially leader declared case impossible 
afterwards however conscience smote sorely much arguing false premise business came conclusion practice law suited honest man 
take large view matters average done harm instance might live good many others perhaps become judge even great judge 
may mention years grew rich rescued surviving old lady lodging house although day know name anonymous friend 
degrees without saying anything kept chambers slipped practice great disappointment everybody connected took authorship 
marvel came pass first book enormous success 
whole world talked 
leading journal delighted discovered someone wrote journals followed suit movement 
one remember already dismissed three four sneering lines came second two column notice 
sold like wildfire suppose merits still read though know wrote since fortunately published pseudonym 
much elated set work write another believe much better book 
jealousies excited leaping fame totally unknown person moreover accentuated foolish article published answer criticisms wherein spoke mind insane freedom biting sarcasm 
indeed even mad enough quote names give example powerful journal first carped work gushed became fashion 
made many bitter enemies found next book appeared 
torn shreds reviled subversive morality religion good arrows days 
called puerile half educated stuff half educated utterly false charge plagiarism cooked well venomously run vast numbers people concluded thief lowest order 
lastly father secret could longer kept sternly disapproved books admit written radical somewhat anti church point view 
result first quarrel made died suddenly 
fastidiousness lack perseverance work solemnly swore would never write another book oath kept till moment least far publication concerned break consider duty animated pecuniary object 
thus came end second attempt carving career 
grown savage cynical rather revengeful also fear 
knowing possess considerable abilities sundry directions sat think things digest past experiences 
truth ancient adage struck upon mind namely money power 
sufficient money could laugh unjust critics example indeed papers would scarcely dare criticise fear lest power bad turn 
could follow ideas life perhaps work good world live surroundings commended 
clear daylight make money capital result father death plus little two books brought 
way could employ best advantage remembered cousin father therefore successful stock broker also affection 
went good easy natured man frankly glad see offered put business minded risk every thing would give share profits 
laughed heartily audacity 
boy said totally inexperienced game might lose us month 
like courage like courage truth want help 
think write 
thought end offered try year fixed salary promise kind partnership suited 
meanwhile remained pocket 
accepted without reluctance since impatience youth wanted everything 
worked hard office soon mastered business knowledge figures taken first class mathematical degree college came aid way acquaintance law literature 
moreover certain aptitude called high finance 
fortune usual showed favourable face 
one year got partnership small share large profits business 
two partner retired took place third share firm 
three cousin satisfied able hands began cease attendance office betook gardening hobby 
four paid altogether although borrow money credit agreement title firm continued 
came extraordinary time boom many remember cost 
made bold stroke 
certain saturday books made found discharging liabilities worth 
following saturday two books made worth l appetit vient en mangeant 
seemed nothing many worth millions 
next year worked done struck balance end found conservative estimate owner million half hard cash equivalent 
tired remember discovery excite 
felt utterly weary wealth hunting city ways 
moreover old fastidiousness lack perseverance asserted 
reflected rather late day perhaps ruin speculation bringing thousands lamentable instances recently come notice considered whether suitable career upright man 
wealth take enjoy life also business acumen came sure times could last 
easy make money rising market falling matter different 
five minutes made mind 
sent junior partners taken two told intended retire 
dismayed loss really firm pointed withdrew capital would sufficient left enable carry 
one blunt honest man said face would dishonourable 
inclined answer sharply remembered words true 
well said leave shall pay five per cent interest share profits 
terms dissolved partnership year lost slump came vengeance 
saved however day earning reasonable income 
never asked 
chapter ii 
bastin bickley behold man without occupation possessor 
considerable fortune large one england nothing like millions dreamed still enough 
make sure remained invested well mostly large mortgages four per cent security good depreciate capital value 
never touch single speculative stock desired think money 
time bought fulcombe property 
cost capital alterations repairs etc say sum may pay net two half per cent 
odd always devoted upkeep place therefore first rate order 
rest live save 
arrangements beautifying furnishing house restoration church memory father occupied amused year finished time began hang heavy hands 
use possessing year nothing upon could spent wants simple acquisition valuable pictures costly furniture limited space 
oh small way like weary king ecclesiast 
made great works possessions great small cattle tried farming lost money gathered silver gold peculiar treasure kings presume means whatever man authority chiefly desires forth 
behold vanity vexation spirit profit sun 
notwithstanding wealth health deference rich man portion especially limit riches known came hated life much thirty 
know society word generally understood taste bored horse racing cards loathed already gambled much big scale 
killing creatures name sport palled upon indeed began doubt right office junior county magistrate place crime occupied hour two month 
lastly neighbors due deference extremely dull 
least could understand seem anything understand quite certain understand 
came learn radical views written certain dreadful somewhat socialistic books form fiction feared mistrusted enemy particular section race 
married showed inclination womenkind also intimate knowledge proclaimed led immoral life though little reflection would shown one neighborhood time seldom left could possibly tempted educated creature courses 
terrible lot man still young possessing intellect necessary achievement deprived ambition 
none 
even wish purchase peerage baronetcy fashion father case tastes many catholic could lose one 
never became diversions 
hobby really amusing becomes obsession 
length lonesome friendlessness oppressed much took steps mitigate 
college life two particular friends think must selected absolutely different 
named bastin bickley 
bastin basil christian name uncouth shock headed flat footed person large rugged frame equally rugged honesty mind almost incredibly simple 
nothing surprised lacked faculty surprise 
like kind fish lies bottom sea takes every kind food great maw without distinguishing flavor 
metaphorically speaking heavenly manna decayed cabbage bastin 
fastidious mental pabulum sort together whatever lay extremes 
yet good painfully good one felt without exertion booked first class ticket straight heaven indeed guardian angel tied round neck birth lest lose already numbered dated like identification disc 
bound add bastin never went wrong never felt slightest temptation 
suppose constitutes real virtue since view certain bible sayings person tempted would like yield temptation equally sinner person yield 
truly good one good tempted weak make effort worth tempter short deserving powder shot 
need hardly add bastin went church indeed could gone anywhere else absorbed naturally doubtless heaven due course 
think likely get know bore angels much continually move higher 
also susceptibilities left probably tread upon toes art never knew equal 
however always loved bastin perhaps one else fact remained totally unconscious perhaps brutal way telling one conceived truth less imagination dormouse generally 
truth jewel one colored veiled many different lights atmospheres 
remains add learned theological fashion among peculiarities slow monotonous voice uttered views long sentences total indifference adverse argument however sound convincing 
friend bickley person quite different character 
like bastin learned tendencies faced another way 
bastin omnivorous throat could swallow camel especially theological camel bickley would strain smallest gnat especially theological gnat 
best upright men yet believed nothing could taste see handle 
convinced instance man brute descended accident call soul mind produced certain action gray matter brain everything apparently inexplicable perfectly mundane explanation one could find miracles certainly never happen never religions fruit human hopes fears convincing proof human weakness notwithstanding infinite variations subjects nature single law victims blind black brutal chance 
bickley clever well cut face always reminded cameo thoughtful brow strong capable hands rather steely mouth mere set suggested controversy uncompromising kind 
naturally church claimed bastin medicine claimed bickley 
happened man succeeded father vicar fulcombe given better living went away shortly purchased place advowson 
time also received letter written large sprawling hand bastin heard years 
went straight point saying bastin seen church paper last incumbent resigned living fulcombe gift 
would therefore obliged would give place yorkshire suit wife health 
may state afterwards learned suit mrs bastin organist pretty 
nature woman temperament insanely jealous actually managed suspicious bastin captured unguarded moment thinking something else would soon thought even looking woman would worshipping baal 
matter fact took months know one female another 
except possible providers subscriptions props mothers meetings women interest 
return engaging honesty mentioned bastin letter went set disabilities added would probably render unsuitable place desired fill 
high churchman fact would certainly offend many claims preacher although extraordinarily well acquainted writings early fathers 
earth question wondered 
hand generally considered good visitor fond walking meant call distant parishioners say 
followed page half evils existing system presentation livings private persons ending suggestion probably committed sin buying particular advowson order increase local authority bought point ignorant 
finally informed christen sick baby five miles away certain moor wet ride bicycle must stop 
stopped 
however ps letter ran follows someone told dead years ago course may another man name owns fulcombe 
doubt post office send back letter 
allusion humble self diffuse pages 
long since received epistle made laugh much course gave living return post even informed would increase stipend sum considered suitable position 
ten days later received another letter bastin scrawl flap envelope informed carried week pocket forgotten post 
except inference returned thanks intended benefits 
say however thought wrong settled matter spiritual importance great hurry though observed rich men nearly always selfish time concerned 
moreover considered ought first made inquiries present character attainments etc etc 
epistle replied telegraph effect soon think making inquiries character archangel one high church saints 
telegram told afterwards considered unseemly even ribald especially given great offence postmaster one sidesmen church 
thus came appointed rev basil bastin living fulcombe feeling sure would provide endless amusement act moral tonic discipline 
also appreciated man blunt candor 
due course arrived confess sundays experience began doubts wisdom choice glad see personally 
sermons bored send sleep excited desire debate 
could profoundly acquainted mysteries world stood amazed ages nothing hot heavy spiritual way dismiss blundering casual words might ordinary incident every day life wondered also idea high church observances mine imagine anybody else 
attempt set 
peculiarities however easy excuse entirely swallowed innate goodness nature soon made beloved everyone place although thought probably things sins never knew discover sin considered beyond reach forgiveness 
bastin indeed charitable man way wide minded 
person could tolerate however wife fancy resembled vessel unattractive vessel full vinegar woman 
name sarah small plain flat sandy haired odious quite obsessed moreover jealousies rev basil pleased suppose every woman countryside fifty throwing 
confess best ability took care outward seeming whenever present instructing sit aside darkened corners present flowers forth 
several easily fell humor thing seen depart dinner party followed glowering sarah handful rosebuds violets say nothing traditional offerings slippers embroidered markers like 
well way coming even think knew hated poisonously 
much basil bastin 
bickley 
met several occasions since college days settled priory time time asked stay 
length came found comfortable london practice nature uncongenial get partners 
reflection made suggestion 
pointed owing popularity amongst seaside visitors neighborhood fulcombe rising one although doctors really first class surgeon miles 
bickley first class surgeon held high hospital appointments indeed still holding 
asked come set would appoint doctor estate also give charge cottage hospital endowing liberty build arrange liked 
considered would great advantage man real ability within reach would guarantee three years whatever income earning london 
thanked warmly end acted idea startling results far prospects concerned 
soon really remarkable skill became known earning money unmarried man could possibly want 
indeed scarcely big operation took place town within twenty miles even much farther away called assist 
needless say advent great boon lived house let quite near whenever spare evening would drop dinner absolutely opposite standpoints discussed things human divine 
thus enabled sharpen wits upon hard steel clear intellect yet sense limited 
must add never converted way thinking never converted converted bastin queerly enough liking 
pounded away bickley frequently getting best argument last bastin rose go generally made remark 
really sad dear bickley find man intellect utterly wrongheaded misguided 
convicted error least half dozen times confess mere pigheadedness 
good night 
sure sarah sitting 
silly old idiot bickley would say shaking fist 
way get see truth would saw head open pour 
would laugh 
two intimate friends although admit rather like equator cultivating close relationships north south poles 
certainly bastin far bickley points earth apart sat equally distant two 
however happy together since certain characters things bind men closely profound differences opinion 
must turn personal affairs 
impossible man satisfy soul anything sort remotest degree answers description husks wealth luxury indolence supplemented occasional theological arguments friends becoming profoundly convinced truth searched round something like noah dove waste waters found nothing 
asked bickley bastin opinions best future course 
bickley proved barren draw 
rubbed nose feebly suggested might go research work course represented ambitions 
asked indignantly could thing without scientific qualifications whatever 
admitted difficulty replied might endow others qualifications 
short become mulch cow sucking scientists replied broke conversation 
bastin idea first teach sunday school secondly career satisfy aspirations might ordained become missionary 
rejection brilliant advice remarked thing could think get married large family might possibly advantage nation ultimately enrich kingdom heaven though things one could quite sure 
rate certain present practice neglecting duty whatever might fact one cumberers earth observed newspaper took read time happily named idle rich 
reminds added clothing club finances perfectly scandalous condition fact debt amount squire parish consider incumbent make good charity obligation 
look friend said ignoring rest answer plain question found marriage success consider duty recommend others got large family speak course replied usual frankness 
indeed many ways disagreeable convinced must right good concerned 
regards family sure know sarah never liked babies perhaps something 
sighed adding see arbuthnot take things find world hope better 
trying unilluminating old donkey exclaimed left shaking head matters general think principally sarah 
way think villagers recognized good lady vinegary nature 
least used call sour sal 
chapter iii 
natalie bastin said marriage stuck mind blundering remarks way perhaps grain honest truth often permeated 
probably position less duty marry 
came rub never experienced leanings way 
much man others many perhaps liked women time repelled 
old fastidiousness came taste always something wrong 
attracted one part nature revolted another part whole preferred without intimate society rather work violence second higher part 
moreover quite beginning career concluded observation man gets better life alone rather another drag side perhaps must dragged 
still true marriage men women dreamed youth always one ideals indeed around vision wrote first book mine successful 
since knew unattainable imperfect conditions however notwithstanding bastin strictures dismissed whole matter mind vain imagination 
alternative reflected upon parliamentary career old begin even toyed one two opportunities offered men wealth advanced views 
never came anything end decided party politics hateful dishonest could bring put neck beneath yoke 
sure tried fail completely done bar literature 
quite certain right 
upshot sought refuge last expedient weary englishmen travel globe trotter leisurely inquiring mind learning much finding like ancient writer quoted already new thing sun certain variations thing 
make exception east interest enormously 
benares came touch certain thinkers opened eyes great deal 
released hidden spring nature hitherto always striving break crust conventions inherited ideas 
know seeking nothing less infinite immortal longings 
listened solemn talk epochs years measureless man reflected thrill man might part every one 
yes bird passage seemed flying darkness darkness still might spread wings light suns millions upon millions years ago might still spread grown radiant glorious millions upon millions years hence time unborn 
could know truth 
life according bickley merely short activity bounded nothingness behind according bastin conventional golden harped haloed immortality word least understand meaning something quite different either something vast splendid beyond reach vision something god sent beginning ending eternal absolute last partaking attributes nature aeon aeon shot light truth learned asked eastern friends talked vaguely long ascetic preparation years upon years learning could quite discover 
sure could clearly know passed heard elsewhere either could would explain 
length gave satisfied effort oriental imagination called life sweet influences eastern stars 
gave went away thinking forget 
forget 
quick new hope rate new aspiration secret child holy desire grew grew within soul till length flashed upon soul mine hidden master must learn lesson 
wonder eastern friends could give name seeing whatever really knew distinguished heard little enough learned teaching soul 
thus became dreamer one longing longing wisdom spirit touch open eyes enable see 
yet happened strangely enough seemed within little interest things world least women taken another guest dwell things world came back shape woman inevitable 
probably decreed since written man live alone lose watching nurturing growth soul happened thus 
went rome way home india stayed 
day arrival wrote name book minister italy time sir alfred upton wished ask dinner reason heard man archeological tastes thought might enable see things otherwise see 
chanced knew devonshire neighbors friends ask dinner following night 
accepted found one considerable party distinguished english people wore orders customary one dines representative sovereign 
seeing shows best us vanity latent first time life sorry none plain mr arbuthnot sir alfred explained politely must go dinner last rest titles without even lady one spare 
lot bettered got found seated italian countess russian prince neither could talk english alas knew foreign language even french addressed seeming surprised understand 
humiliated ignorance although fact ignorant education classical 
indeed good classic kept knowledge less especially since became idle man 
confusion occurred italian countess might know latin language derived addressed tongue 
stared sir alfred far overheard also knew latin burst laughter proceeded explain joke loud voice first french english assembled company became infected merriment also stared curiosity 
first time saw natalie owing mistake driver arrived rather late introduced 
father daughter mother dead seated end table behind fan like arrangement white madonna lilies bent forward like others looking fashion head distance seemed though surrounded crowned lilies 
indeed greatest art could produced beautiful effect however really one naked accident 
angel looking upon earth lilies heaven rather absurd thought flashed mind 
quite realize face first except seemed dark fair fact waving hair grew rather low upon forehead dark large soft eyes gray 
know moment know really beautiful certainly light shone eyes seemed reflected upon delicate features beauty 
like glowing thin vase purest alabaster within lamp placed felt effect arise chance like lily setting lamp spirit within 
eyes met suppose saw wonder admiration mine 
rate amused smile faded leaving face rather serious though still sweetly serious tinge color crept first hue dawn creeps pearly sky 
withdrew behind screen lilies rest dinner thought never coming end practically saw 
noted passed although tall rounded graceful shape hands peculiarly delicate 
afterwards drawing room father talked table introduced saying daughter real archaeologist mr arbuthnot think ask may able help 
bustled away speak important guests think seeking political information 
father exaggerates said soft sympathetic voice perhaps motioned seat side 
talked places things particularly desired see well end went back hotel love natalie afterwards confessed went bed love 
curious business like meeting old friend one separated circumstances score years anything else 
speak intimate first knew although something new something different could remember lines thought veins memory possess common 
one point absolutely clear solely everyday ancient appeal woman man man woman drew us together though doubtless part attachment human conditions must seeing nature bait ensure continuance race 
something something quite beyond elementary impulse 
rate loved one evening shelter solemn walls great coliseum rome hour shut except confessed love 
really think must chosen spot tacit mutual consent felt fitting 
old impregnated every human experience direst crime tyrant thought god sublimest sacrifice martyr already half god every vice virtue also lies extremes seemed fitting altar whereon offer hearts caused beat 
natalie betrothed within month first meeting 
within three married prevent delay naturally sir alfred delighted seeing possessed small private resources able make ample provision daughter hitherto shown somewhat difficult business matrimony bordering twenty seventh year 
everybody delighted everything went smoothly sledge sliding slope frozen snow mists time hid whatever might end slope 
probably plain worst upward rise ordinary life 
thought thought 
certainly never dreamed precipice 
young comparison quite healthy rich thinks precipices circumstances disaster seems eliminated death yet long way yet ought done known smooth surfaces without impediment runners often end something kind 
bound say returned home fulcombe course met great reception including ringing tune new peal bells given church bastin made haste point 
wife seems nice beautiful lady arbuthnot reflected aloud dinner mrs bastin glowering usual though know escorted room natalie really come think unusually fortunate person 
possess great deal money much right seem done little earn spend quite like nice property ought owned great number people according views express thought would acknowledge everything else man want 
strange favored particular merits one see 
however doubt come even end get share troubles like others 
perhaps mrs arbuthnot children much take 
perhaps lose money work living might good 
added still thinking aloud fashion perhaps die young kind face although course hope added waking 
know wandering words struck cold proverbial funeral bell marriage feast nothing 
suppose flash intuition knew would come true appointed cassandra 
perhaps uncanny knowledge overcame natural indignation super gaucherie one bastin could capable even prevented replying merely sat still looked 
bickley reply vigor 
forgive saying bastin said bristling remarks may may accordance principles religion seem singularly bad taste 
would turned stomachs gathering early christians appear worst mannered people world decent heathen feast neck would wrung bird ill omen 
asked bastin blankly 
said thought truth 
truth better call good taste 
say think also truth replied bickley growing furious 
use christianity cloak bad manners 
teaches consideration sympathy others seem none 
moreover since talk death people wives tell something doctor never attended 
highly probable opinion die mrs arbuthnot quite healthy person good prospect life 
perhaps said bastin 
god shall complain bickley snorted though see know 
cast reflections early christians people strong principle living rough times wage war established devil worship know angry smashed statues venus forth place done 
course would doubts early christians iconoclastic performances well curse sprang left room 
followed 
let supposed scene ill feeling bastin bickley 
contrary much attached kind quarrel meant strong expression individual views accustomed college days 
instance bastin always talking early christians missionaries bickley loathed early christians destruction wrought egypt italy greece elsewhere beautiful missionaries said degrading spoiling native races inducing wear clothes rendering liable disease 
bastin would answer souls important bodies bickley replied thing soul except stupid imagination priests differed entirely point 
quite impossible either convince conversation would end drift something mutually interested natural history hygiene neighborhood 
may state bickley keen professional eye mistaken diagnosed mrs bastin state health dangerous 
matter fact suffering heart disease doctor often recognize color lips etc brought death following circumstances husband attended ecclesiastical function town twenty miles away returned train would brought home five clock 
arrive waited station last train came seven clock without beloved basil 
winter night tore priory begged lend dog cart drive said town look 
expostulated folly proceeding saying doubt basil safe enough forgotten telegraph thought would save sixpence wire cost 
came natalie intense amusement result jealous nature spoken 
said never slept night away husband since married many designing persons could say might happen especially favorite handsome 
bastin fine looking man rugged way 
suggested might little confidence replied darkly confidence anybody 
end lent cart fast horse good driver went 
reaching town question two half hours later searched high low wind sleet found basil 
appeared gone exeter look cathedral building done missing last train slept night 
one morning nearly locked mad woman drove back vicarage find basil 
even go bed raged house wet clothes fell utterly exhausted 
husband return following morning full information cathedral dangerously ill actually passed away uttering violent tirade supposed suspicious proceedings 
end truly odious british matron 
days bastin peculiar mental process canonised imagination kind saint 
loving would say devoted wife dear humphrey assure even midst death struggle last thoughts words caused bickley snort usual vigor kicked silence beneath table 
chapter iv 
death departure must tell terrible sorrow turned life bitterness hopes ashes 
never man woman happier together natalie 
mentally physically spiritually perfectly mated loved dearly 
truly one 
yet something filled vague fears especially found become mother 
would talk child would sigh shake head eyes filling tears say must count continuance happiness great 
tried laugh away doubts though whenever seemed hear bastin slow voice remarking casually might die might commented quality claret 
last however grew terrified asked bluntly meant 
quite know dearest replied especially wonderfully well 
asked 
think companionship going broken little 
little exclaimed 
yes humphrey 
think shall taken away know mean nodded towards churchyard 
oh god groaned 
want say added quickly thing happen happens every day implore dearest humphrey much distressed since sure find 
explain know 
prayed light come 
know talking reunion mr bastin kind conventional heaven speaks though reach one stumbled darkness minute fine new house next door excellent servants made everything ready arrival lights turned 
something quite different much real 
bent ostensibly pat head little black cocker spaniel called tommy given puppy highly intelligent affectionate animal adored loved dog love 
really knew hide tears fled room lest see mine 
went heard dog whimpering peculiar way though sympathetic knowledge communicated wonderful animal intelligence 
night spoke bickley matter repeating exactly passed 
expected smiled grave rather sarcastic way made light 
dear humphrey said torment fancies 
everyday occurrence among women wife condition 
sometimes take one form sometimes another 
got baby hear 
tried comforted vain 
days weeks went like long nightmare due course event happened 
bickley attending case line said preferred friend wife concerned somebody else called 
put charge good local man large experience domestic matters 
tell everything went wrong details let 
ultimately bickley operate surpassing skill could saved would done 
man misjudged conditions late nothing could help either mother child little girl died shortly born christened also name natalie 
called say farewell wife found radiant triumphant even weakness 
know whispered faint voice 
understood chloroform passed away tell 
everything quite well darling 
go seem called go far away 
oh wonderful place find knowing found 
good bye little little died 
time seemed die could 
buried child fulcombe rather buried ashes since could endure beloved body see corruption 
afterwards spoke last words natalie bickley bastin somehow seemed wish learn separate views 
latter may explain present end spiritual capacity think least understood nature drama passing eyes 
prayers christening absorbed attention never man could think one thing time 
told exactly happened repeated words natalie spoke much interested nebulous way said delightful meet example good christian wife actually saw something heaven gone 
faith thanked god fairly robust still undoubted occurrence sort acted refreshment like rain pasture rather dry know added breaking simile 
remarked seemed speak sense indicated appeared allude something quite near hand less immediate 
know anything nearer hand hereafter answered 
expect meant probably soon die join paradise worthy 
course wise put much reliance upon words spoken people last often quite know saying 
indeed sometimes think case wife really seemed talk good deal rubbish 
good bye promised see widow jenkins afternoon varicose veins cut stop wasting time pleasant conversation 
thinks much varicose veins loss wives 
wonder bastin ideas unpleasant conversation may thought watched depart already wool gathering subject probably heresy one early fathers occupied thoughts 
bickley listened tale sympathetic silence doctor patient 
obliged speak said interesting example tendency certain minds towards romantic vision sometimes asserts even throes death 
know added put faith none things 
wish could reason science show lack foundation 
world whole sad place arrive passions others implanted nature although cares nothing individual death tender towards impulse races every sort preserve collective life 
indeed impulse nature least chief manifestation 
consequently whether gnats elephants anything beyond even stars aught know must make best things taking good evil come getting life leaves us need trouble 
good time little happy bad time wretched 
perhaps future mental balance asserted good times afternoon days follow twilight dark 
hope may well look thing face 
confess dear fellow experience convinces marriage avoided whatever inconvenience 
indeed long wondered anyone take responsibility bringing child world 
probably nobody cold blood except misguided idiots like bastin added 
would twenty luck intervened 
believe nothing friend said 
nothing sorry say except see five senses appreciate 
reject possibility miracle instance depends mean miracle 
science shows us kinds wonders great grandfathers would called miracles nothing laws beginning understand 
give instance 
well replied hazard assured someone man could live thousand years tell fool liar 
impossible 
identity spirit animating principle call flit body body say successive ages dead communicate living convince things arbuthnot mind desire convinced take back every word said walk fulcombe white sheet proclaiming fool 
must get cottage hospital cut widow jenkins varicose veins 
tangible real rate largest ever saw indeed 
give dreams old boy take something useful 
might go back fiction writing seem leanings way know need publish stories except privately edification friends 
parthian shaft bickley took departure make job widow jenkins legs 
took advice 
next months write something occupied thoughts less 
lies safe minute somehow never able make mind burn cost much physical mental toil 
finished melancholy returned added force 
everything house took tongue cried past days 
walls echoed voice could never hear looking glasses saw reflection lost presence 
although moved purposes sleep little room end building footsteps seemed creep bed night heard rustle remembered dress without door 
place grew hateful

one afternoon bastin arrived carrying book state high indignation 
work written said ribald traveller grossly traduced character missionaries south sea islands especially society subscribed threw table righteous wrath 
bickley picked opened photograph pretty south sea island girl clad flowers nothing else held towards bastin saying child nature object call distinctly attractive though perhaps wear hibiscus blooms difference women little lower 
devil always attractive replied bastin gloomily 
child nature indeed call child sin 
photograph enough make poor sarah turn grave 
asked bickley seeing wide seas roll dusky venus 
also thought according hebrew legend sin came bark garments 
search scriptures bickley broke cultivate accuracy 
fig leaves symbolised arrival 
garments think skin developed later 
perhaps went bickley turned page referred late mrs bastin would preferred thus held another illustration woman 
native belle appeared conversion clad broken stays suppose stays seemed bulge flow every direction dirty white dress several sizes small kind salvation army bonnet without crown prayer book held pressed middle general effect hideous curious way improper 
certainly said bastin though admit clothes seem fit buttoned ought 
pictures much letterpress false scandalous accusations complain 
complain asked bickley 
probably quite true though could never ascertain without visiting lady home 
could afford exclaimed bastin rising anger like go expose vile traducer cloth

call innocent bickley murder eat missionaries dare say eat missionary bastin hungry enough answer something occurred change conversation 
kept book read neutral observer came conclusion south sea islands land always afternoon must charming place perhaps stars tropics scent flowers might enable one forget little least take edge memory 
visit escape another long dreary english winter could alone 
bastin bickley eternal arguments might amuse 
well come also one money things always arranged 
idea root absurd conversation took curious hold 
thought evening alone night arose dreams 
dreamed lost natalie appeared showed picture 
long low land curving shore ends picture whereon grew tall palms great combers broke upon gleaming sand 
picture seemed become reality saw natalie strangely changeful aspect strangely varying face figure strangely bright standing mouth pass whereof little bordering cliffs covered bushes low trees whose green almost hid lovely flowers

good idea one could get beaten tracks see places never seldom visited 
make inquiries 
celebrate occasion let us another glass port drink toast 
hesitated lost bastin murmuring something without stout next day penance 
asked toast thought suggesting utter confusion 
shook head whereon result cogitation bastin submitted unknown would suitable 
bickley said thought foolish idea everything worth knowing already known good drinking rest toast truth would better 
notion came 
let us combine said drink unknown truth 
though bastin grumbled performance made feel like pilate 
pilates way replied sigh

laughed unknown reason felt happier done months 
oh writer tourist tale south sea islands could guessed fruit light thrown seed would yield us world made inquiries london agency hired yachts sold idle rich

planchette business somewhat curious ending 
nights later jacobsen working asked put question 
oblige inquired day reach fremantle port perth

discovered path ran diagonally side cliff nowhere fifty sixty feet height possibly formed shore land perhaps lake 
path went following tracks many human feet reaching crest cliff looked us basking beautiful morning sun sky clear clouds last awful effort destroyed ship cyclone passed away 
standing plain ran little stream good water whereof tommy drank greedily following example 
right left plain could see stretched bushland towered many palms rather ragged lashing gale 
looking inland perceived ground sloped gently downwards ending distance miles large lake

degrees brown figures emerged plain number hundreds saw male female 
women clothed nothing except flowers little girdle men armed wooden weapons also wore girdle flowers 
children many quite naked 
among people observed tall person clothed seemed magnificent feather cloak walking around number grotesque forms adorned hideous masks basket like head dresses surmounted plumes 
king chief priests medicine men splendid said bickley triumphantly 
bastin also contemplated enthusiasm raw material upon hoped get work

clearly quick minded enough saw point 
words girls brought platters chief others took portions food hazard ate show poisoned watching throats make sure swallowed 
returned took food though bickley ate pointed doctor understood use antidotes clearly make experiment 
however nothing happened indeed said good

operation took place afternoon ship marama made mind trust us thoroughly 
performed deck presence awed multitude watched shore saw bickley appear clean nightshirt wash hands uttered groan wonder 
evidently considered magical religious ceremony indeed ever afterwards called bickley great priest sometimes great healer later days 
grievance bastin considered robbed proper title especially learned among known bellower loud voice addressed 
bickley particularly appreciate compliment 
help administered chloroform done shelter sail fear lest people think smothering chief 
operation went satisfactory conclusion 
omit details electric battery red hot wire came play 
said bickley triumphantly finished tying vessels made everything neat tidy bandages afraid might bleed death think fear made real job 
advancing horrid tumor hands showed triumph crowd beneath groaned threw faces 
doubtless sacred relic orofena 
marama came anesthetic bickley gave something sent sleep twelve hours time people waited beneath 
dangerous period difficulty persuade dead although bickley assured would sleep time magic worked 
still glad woke following morning two three leading men could see alive 
rest lengthy simple consisting merely keeping quiet suitable diet fear wound opening 
achieved somehow help intelligent native woman suppose one wives five days later enabled present healed though rather tottery affectionate subjects 
great scene may imagined 
bore away litter native woman watch another carry relic preserved basket us acclaimed gods 
thenceforward nothing fear orofena except bastin though know time 
living ship growing bored although employed empty hours conversation selected natives thereby improving knowledge language 
bickley best since already patients began arrive occupied 
one first man tommy bitten 
carried us almost comatose state suffering apparently symptoms snake poisoning 
afterward turned conceived tommy divine venomous lizard could make horrible noise began suffer one might bite creature 
nothing bickley could enough save ultimately died convulsions circumstance enormously enhanced tommy reputation 
tell truth took advantage explain tommy fact supernatural animal sort tame demon harmed people malevolent intentions towards served tried steal possessions intrude upon inconvenient hours especially dark 
terrible indeed even skill great priest ie bickley could avail save bitten rage 
even barked dangerous conveyed curse might last generations 
set bastin 
wandered said look shells knew practice religious orations polynesian tongue waves audience demosthenes said done perfect political orator 
personally admit relied terrors tommy safeguard us theft troubles upon native taboo priestly oaths 
end left ship padlocked door padlock explained magical instrument bit worse tommy moved inland kind triumphal procession priests singers going orofenans sang extremely well minstrels following playing upon instruments like flutes behind came bearers carrying goods needed 
took us beautiful place grove palms ridge grew many breadfruit trees commanded view ocean upon one side lake strange brown mountain top 
midst native gardens found fine house built us kind mud brick thatched palm leaves surrounded fenced courtyard beaten earth wide overhanging verandahs comfortable place indeed delicious climate 
took abode visiting ship occasionally see well awaiting events 
bickley soon began happen shape ever increasing stream patients 
population island considerable anything five ten thousand far could judge among course number sick 
ophthalmia instance prevalent disease growths marama suffered say nothing surgical cases resulting accident nervous ailments 
bickley called upon deal remarkable success help books tropical diseases ample supplies medical necessaries 
first enjoyed much established house three weeks remarked putting solid ten hours work holiday getting might well back old practice difference earning several thousands year 
poor woman arrived baby convulsions whose necessities obliged sacrifice supper came man fallen palm tree broken leg 
escape since somehow established reputation wisdom soon mastered sufficient language every kind knotty case laid decision 
short became sort chief justice easy office involved acquirement native law intricate peculiar especially matrimonial cases 
oppressive activities bastin looked gloomy eye 
fellows seem busy said one evening find nothing 
seem want merely set good example drinking water tea swallow whisky palm wine whatever negative kind work especially getting tired planting things garden playing policeman round wreck nobody goes near 
even tommy better least bark hunt rats 
see said bickley following trades 
arbuthnot lawyer acts judge 
surgeon may add general general practitioner work medicine enormous much neglected practice 
therefore clergyman go likewise 
ten thousand people observe yet converted single one 
thus spoke bickley light unguarded moment usual object known getting rise bastin 
little guess 
bastin thought ponderously said strange peculiar sources providence sometimes sends inspirations 
wisdom flows babes sucklings well agnostics mockers reason see scoffed bickley except rule wells flow 
jest ill timed may add foolish continued bastin 
add given idea doubt intended 
metaphorically speaking gird loins try bear light heathen blackness 
one first ever old fellow 
need girding loins hot climate inquired bickley innocence 
pyjamas white green umbrella would well 
bastin vouchsafed reply sat rest evening plunged deep thought 
following morning approached marama asked leave teach people gods 
chief readily granted thinking believe alluded orders issued accordingly 
effect bastin allowed go everywhere unmolested talk would would must listen respect 
thus began missionary career orofena working good earnest man way excited even admiration bickley 
started school children held fine spreading tree 
listened well exceedingly quick intellect soon began pick elements knowledge 
tried persuade clothe little naked bodies failure complete although much supplication bigger girls arrive chaplet flowers round necks also preached adults successful way especially became familiar language 
listened certain extent understood argued put poor bastin awful questions whole bench bishops could answered 
still answer somehow politely accepted interpretation theological riddles 
observed got best telling stories old testament account creation world human beings also deluge etc 
indeed one elders said yes quite true 
heard fathers deluge taken place round orofena swallowing great countries sparing good 
bastin surprised asked caused deluge 
replied oro name god oro dwelt yonder mountain lake whose representation worshipped idols 
said god dwelt heaven replied calm certainty dwells mountain lake never dared approach mountain 
indeed giving name oro divinity admitting might dwell mountain well everywhere else bastin able make progress 
conceded without scruples however make considerable progress much fact perceived priests oro beginning grow jealous increasing authority people 
bastin naturally triumphant even exclaimed exultingly within year would half population baptised 
within year dear fellow said bickley throat cut sacrifice probably also 
pity within time stamped ophthalmia diseases island 
leaving bastin good work aside say little country 
information gathered journeys made inquiries chief marama become devoted us found orofena quite large place 
shape island circular broad band territory surrounding great lake spoken turn surrounded smaller island rose mountain top 
land known near shores orofena never visited anyone except strangers hundred years ago sacrificed eaten 
island covered forest inhabitants lacked energy indeed tools fell 
extremely lazy people would cultivate enough bananas food satisfy immediate needs 
truth lived mostly upon breadfruit products wild trees 
thus came years scarcity drought climatic causes prevented forest trees bearing suffered much hunger 
years hundreds would perish remainder resorted dreadful expedient cannibalism 
sometimes shoals fish avoided shores reducing great misery 
domestic animal pig roamed half wild great numbers never taken trouble breed captivity 
resources therefore limited accounted comparative smallness population reduced wicked habit infanticide practiced order lighten burden bringing children 
traditions reached land belief always forefathers much greater 
poetical sang songs language could understand said tongue forefathers spoken 
also several strange customs know origin 
opinion bickley shared fact shrunken deteriorated remnant high race coming end age inter breeding 
indeed notwithstanding primitive savagery qualities much resembled polynesians curious air antiquity 
one felt known older world mysteries though forgotten 
also language time came speak perfectly copious musical expressive idioms 
one circumstance must mention 
walking country observed enormous holes measuring much hundred yards across depth fifty feet alluvial lands although traces existed also solid rock 
rock know none us geologists seemed partake nature granite 
certainly coral like coast primeval formation 
asked marama caused holes shrugged shoulders said know fathers declared made stones falling heaven 
course suggested meteorites mind 
submitted idea bickley one rare intervals leisure came make examination 
meteorites said shower struck earth past geological age life must destroyed remains ought exist bottom holes 
look like effect high explosives course impossible though know else could caused craters 
went back work nothing antiquity interested bickley much 
present problems enough would say neither lived past expected share future 
remained curious made opportunity scramble bottom one craters taking natives wooden tools 
found good deal soil either washed surface resulting decomposition rock though oddly enough nothing grew 
directed dig 
astonishment appeared corner great worked stone quite unlike crater indeed seemed marble 
examination showed block beautifully carved bas relief apparently design leaves flowers 
disturbed soil also picked life sized marble hand woman exquisitely finished apparently broken statue might work one great greek sculptors 
moreover third finger hand representation ring whereof unfortunately bezel destroyed 
put hand pocket darkness coming could pursue research disinter block 
wished return next day informed politely marama would safe priests oro declared sought meddle buried things god would grow angry bring disaster 
persisted said least must go alone since native would accompany added earnestly prayed go 
great regret disappointment obliged give idea 
chapter viii 
bastin attempts martyr crown carved stone marble hand took great hold imagination 
mean could come bottom hole unless indeed part building ornaments destroyed neighborhood stone uncovered corner seemed far big carried ship must weighed several tons 
besides ships carry things world none visited island last two centuries rate local tradition would recorded wonderful fact 
edifices covered elegant carving standing place adorned lovely statues would disgraced best period greek art thing incredible except supposition relics utterly lost civilisation 
bickley much puzzled 
could say world infinitely old many things might happened whereof record 
even bastin excited little imagination represented zero could say suppose someone left anyhow matter much certain leanings towards ancient mysterious could put fashion 
remembered unapproachable mountain midst lake appeared something looked like ruins seen top cliff glasses 
rate point might clear 
saying nothing anybody one morning slipped away walked edge lake distance five six miles rough country 
arrived perceived cone shaped mountain center mile lake shore much larger thought quite three hundred feet high indeed large circumference 
sides evidently terraced one broad terraces half way facing towards rising sun ruin like remains heaped 
examined glasses 
undoubtedly cyclopean ruin built great blocks colored stone seemed shattered earthquake explosion 
pillars mighty gateway remains walls 
trembled excitement stared stared 
could get place see observed flat bush clad land foot mountain ran seemed residue stone pier ended large table topped rock two three hundred feet across 
even far reach swimming besides aught knew might alligators lake 
walked borders till presently came path led patch variety cotton palm 
following path discovered boat house thatched palm leaves 
inside two good canoes paddles floating tied stumps trees fiber ropes 
instantly made mind would paddle island investigate 
step one canoes light cut 
looking saw man crouching door place boat house order enter paused guiltily 
friend sea name islanders given said voice marama say take row lake chief answered carelessly 
indeed friend 
treated badly tired life mean asked 
come sunlight friend explain 
hesitated till saw marama lifting heavy wooden spear carried remembered unarmed 
came 
mean chief asked angrily clear patch cotton palm 
mean friend near making longer journey thought 
patience listen 
saw leaving village morning followed suspecting purpose 
yes followed alone saying nothing priests oro fortunately away watching bellower reasons 
saw searching secrets mountain magic tubes make things big small things far come near followed canoes 
plain enough marama 
told friend sea yonder hill called orofena whence island takes name sacred said set foot thereon die suppose great die like others 
least although love come away canoe discover whether 
canoes used asked irritation 
see flat rock friend hole beyond mouth cave appeared great storm brought land used convey offerings laid upon rock 
beyond man may go since beginning man ever gone 
offerings oromatuas spirits great dead live 
oromatuas oro always something oro 
oro oro god friend though true priests say greater god called degai creator fate made things directs things 
well suppose oro servant degai lives mountain thought lived grove yonder priests told image 
know friend sea held beginning 
image grove visited spirit time time 
pray come back priests discover forget canoes upon lake 
thinking wisest turned matter laugh walked away village 
road tried extract information without success 
know built ruin upon mountain destroyed 
know terraces came 
knew convulsion nature resulted tidal wave thrown ship upon island mountain seen quiver like tree wind though within great forces work 
observed risen good many feet surface lake might noted water mark upon shore also mouth cave appeared 
priests said oromatuas dwelt stirring portended great things 
indeed great things happened arrived land thanked told nothing learned dropped subject never mentioned us least long 
heart determined would reach mountain even though must risk life 
something seemed call place though drawn magnet 
happened long go mountain obliged 
came thus 
one night asked bastin getting missionary work 
replied well indeed one great obstacle path idol grove 
accursed image believed whole island would become christian 
asked plain 
explained work thwarted idol since converts declared dare baptised sat grove 
spirit would bewitch perhaps steal night murder 
spirit friends sorcerers suggested 
arbuthnot 
know believe devilish men sometimes offer human sacrifices satanic fetish drought anything sort 
quite believe answered scarcely remove god livelihood authority afraid want sacrificed nothing done 
moment called away 
went heard bastin muttering something martyrs paid attention 
little guess going pious obstinate mind 
effect one else would remove idol quite ready 
however cunning business almost jesuitical indeed 
one word breathe dark plans still less bickley 
went teaching lamenting time time stumbling block idol expressing wonder might circumvented change hearts islanders otherwise 
sad record fact dear old bastin went near telling fib connection matter suppose ever done life 
happened thus 
one day bickley sharp eye caught sight bastin walking looked like bottle whisky pocket 
hallo old fellow said self denying ordinance broken know took pegs sly pointed bottle 
insinuating bickley absorb spirits surreptitiously mistaken usual saying good deal 
bottle contains scotch whisky paraffin although admit label may misled unintentionally far concerned 
going paraffin asked bickley 
bastin colored tan replied awkwardly paraffin good keep away mosquitoes one stand smell upon one skin 
brought sole object 
truth anxious experiment lamp design made um native wood departed hurry 
next old bastin wants tell lie commented bickley make mind stick 
wonder paraffin going dose patients hope 
arguing day great remedy taken internally quite unaware lamp variety used purpose 
perhaps means swallow show right suggested 
stomach pump hand said bickley matter dropped 
next morning got light 
elementary knowledge main facts astronomy remained boyhood attended lectures subject tried refresh help encyclopedia brought ship wished attempt obtain idea position help stars 
endeavor may say failed absolutely know take stellar observation 
way native house observed lantern carried compartment occupied bastin empty wondered whither gone hour 
arriving observation post rocky eminence open ground tommy side took seat telescope astonished see rather hear great number natives walking past base mound towards bush 
remembered one marama think informed great sacrifice oro dawn day 
thought matter occupied futile study heavenly bodies 
length dawn broke put period labors 
glancing round descended little hill saw flame light appear suddenly half mile away among trees knew concealed image oro 
personally never curiosity look knew hideous idol stuck feathers bedizenments 
flame shot suddenly straight still air followed seconds later sound dull explosion went 
also followed something else scream rage infuriated mob 
foot hill stopped wonder sounds might mean 
sudden appeared bickley attending urgent case asked exploding gunpowder 
told idea 
answered 
ass bastin game 
guess wanted paraffin 
listen row 
sacrificing bastin perhaps replied half jest 
revolver nodded 
always wore pistols went dark hours 
perhaps better go see 
started covered hundred yards girl recognized one bastin converts came flying towards us screaming help help kill bellower fire cook like pig expected said bickley 
ran hard evidently time lose 
went extracted terrified girl forced show us way sacrifice offered bastin appeared making fire applied god oro instantly burst flame 
ran back calling devil dead 
loud explosion oro flew pieces 
burning head went long way air falling one priests killed 
thereon priests people seized bellower made fast 
engaged heating oven put cook 
ready would eat honor oro 
serve right gasped bickley stout good runner 
leave people gods alone instead blowing gunpowder know answered 
hope shall get time cooked eaten bastin wheezed bickley breath gave 
chanced stone ovens take long time heat 
edge fiery grave hands legs bound palm fiber shackles stood bastin quite unmoved smiling indeed sort seraphic way irritated us extremely 
round danced infuriated priests oro round shrieking howling rage population orofena 
rushed suddenly none tried stop us took stand either side producing pistols 
thank coming said bastin silence followed though think least use 
recall early martyrs ever roasted eaten though course throwing boiling oil water fairly common 
take rite sacrificial even low sense sacramental merely one common cannibalism 
stared bickley gasped eaten matter eaten oh replied bastin difference world though one expect appreciate 
please quiet wish say prayers 
imagine stones hot enough office within twenty minutes long 
moment marama appeared evidently state great perturbation 
priests sorcerers dancing imagine priests baal must done filled fury 
rolled eyes stuck tongues uttered weird cries shook wooden knives placid bastin 
matter asked sternly chief 
friend sea 
bellower sacrifice offered oro dawn rushed forward thrust something legs image god poured yellow water fire caused burst fierce flame 
ran away mocked god presently loud report flew pieces killed man 
therefore bellower must sacrificed 
asked 
image gone piece ascended fell upon bellower would happened god angry one priests killed 
therefore sacrificed god eaten bellower merely spirit bade 
ingenious argument seemed produce effect upon marama priests appeal 
eat cried 
enemies oro worked sacrilege moreover judge demeanor bulk people seemed agree 
things began look ugly 
priests rushed forward threatening us wooden weapons one even aimed blow bickley missed inch two 
look friend called doctor whose temper rising name great priest great healer well careful lest show kill well heal least intimidated threat man great bedizened fellow literally foaming mouth rage rushed forward club raised apparently object dashing bickley brains 
suddenly bickley lifted revolver fired 
man shot heart sprang air fell upon face stone dead 
consternation people never seen us shoot anything quite unacquainted properties firearms supposed merely instruments making noise 
stared gasped fear astonishment fled pursued tommy barking leaving us alone two dead men 
time teach lesson said bickley replaced empty cartridge seizing dead man rolled burning pit 
yes answered presently got fright come back teach us one 
bastin said nothing seemed dazed turn events taken 
suggest asked bickley 
flight answered 
ship might hold 
expect 
look cutting road 
island lake dare follow us holy ground 
going live island asked bickley 
know replied quite certain stay shall die 
well said let us try 
speaking cutting bastin bonds 
thank said 
great relief stretch one arms compressed cords 
time know really grateful 
martyr crown hanging speak vanished pit like man bickley murdered 
look exclaimed exasperated bickley say much bastin chuck pit look martyr crown think done enough mischief one morning 
trying shift responsibility unfortunate man destruction oh shut trot broke bickley 
infernal savages coming blessed converts leading van 
trotted mean pace 
passed bastin stooped picked head image oro much atalanta academy pictures represented apples bore away triumph 
know scorched ejaculated intervals might trim stick new body original false god 
nothing left 
matter fact never real danger pursuit half hearted indeed 
begin first rage orofenans fond us particular wish us death ardor sorcerers wished much greatly cooled mysterious annihilation idol violent deaths two companions thought might reduplicated persons 
came chase noisy neither close eager 
reached edge lake boat house spoken already traveling little walk 
made bastin unfasten better two canoes good luck almost filled offerings doubtless according custom must made upon day feast oro watched surprise boat house door 
ready slipped took seats tommy jumping us pushed canoe heavily laden lake 
distance forty paces judged beyond wooden spear throw rested upon paddles see would happen 
crowd islanders rushed lake edge stood staring us stupidly 
bastin thinking occasion opportune lifted hideous head idol carefully washed began preach downfall god grove 
action appeared awake memories forebodings minds congregation 
perhaps ancient prophecy concerned know 
rate one priests shouted something whereon everybody began talk 
stooping threw water lake rubbed sand mud hair making genuflexions toward mountain middle turned departed 
think better go back asked bastin 
evidently words touched minds melting beneath light truth 
oh means replied bickley sarcasm spears touch us bodies soon melting fires pit 
perhaps right said bastin least admit made matters difficult unjustifiable homicide priest think meant injure seriously really bad fellow though opinionated ways 
also suppose anybody expected run head martyr crown 
settles another matter 
like butterfly exclaimed enraged bickley 
yes like put way though simile seems poor one like sunbeam would better 
bickley gave way paddle vigorously canoe nearly possible upset lake 
due course reached flat rock offerings proved quite wide double croquet lawn much longer 
asked pointing certain knobs edge rock spot curved projecting point made little harbor 
bickley examined answered say remains stone mooring posts worn many thousands years weather 
yes look cut cables upon base one big cables must 
stared one another bickley bastin still engaged contemplating blackened head god overthrown 
chapter ix 
island lake made canoe fast landed great rock perceive really peninsula 
say joined main land lake island broad roadway quite fifty yards across appeared end mouth cave 
causeway noted remarkable thing namely two grooves separated exact distance nine feet ran mouth cave vanished 
explain said bickley 
paths said worn countless feet walking thousands years 
cultivate art observation arbuthnot 
say bastin stared grooves spectacles replied say anything except see anybody make paths 
indeed place seems quite unpopulated orofenans told never landed would die 
part superstitious nonsense 
idea head better tell us quickly breakfast 
hungry 
always remarked bickley even people appetites might affected 
well think great plateau landing place flying machines air shed garage 
bastin stared 
think better breakfast said 
two roast pigs canoe lots food enough last us week say 
course understand blood shed thrown balance 
believe effect except hardened 
flying machines invented years ago brothers wright america 
bastin said bickley begin regret leave take part another breakfast yonder mean principal dish 
providence prevented bickley doubtless unworthy glorious end 
lucky providence good shot pistol 
stop talking nonsense listen 
paths worn feet would run edge rock 

begin gentle depression slope upwards somewhat steeply 
air machines evidently large lit depression possibly bird ran wheels sledge skids along grooves air shed mountain 
come cave see 
till breakfast said bastin 
get pig 
matter fact supper last night taking class native boys making arrangements 
whistled 
seemed feasible 
yet could things unloaded canoe ate 
bastin appetite splendid 
indeed ask remember supply done know find 
take thought morrow replied 
doubt come somewhere helped another chop 
never admired much 
couple hours cruelly murdered eaten 
seem affect least 
bastin man ever known really perfect faith 
quality worth one makes happiness 
great thing care whether breakfasted breakfast see lots driftwood remarked unfortunately tea climate little use unless indeed catch fish cook 
stop talking eating help us haul canoe said bickley 
three us dragged carried canoe long way lake fearing lest natives come bear provisions 
given tommy breakfast scraps walked cave 
glanced companions 
bickley face alight scientific eagerness 
dreams speculations facts learned seemed say learn 
past going show secrets tell men long ago lived died far advanced point road civilisation stand little hour existence 
bastin mildly interested 
obviously half mind thinking something else probably converts main island school class fixed hour circumstances prevented attending 
indeed like lot wife casting glances behind towards wicked place forced flee 
neither past future much real interest bastin bickley though different reasons 
former done latter quite content leave hands 
clear idea thereof probably undiscovered land appeared big pleasant place unbelievers erroneous doctrines sinners sternly repressed clad white surplice proper ecclesiastical trappings would argue eternally early fathers due course utterly annihilate bickley moral sense 
personally man extremely attached bickley necessary wrong headed nuisance become accustomed 
feel know describe 
extraordinary attraction semi spiritual exaltation think 
cave mouth might magnet drawing soul 
body afraid daresay circumstances sufficiently desperate 
castaways upon island probably uncharted one thousands recesses vast ocean little chance escape 
offended religious instincts primeval inhabitants island forced flee rocky mountain center lake food brought us accident consumed doubt forced choose death starvation attempted retreat hands justly infuriated savages 
yet facts oppress drawn drawn knew doom well matter 
therefore none us cared bastin faith equal emergency always white robed heaven waiting beyond imagination go often wondered whether pictured mrs bastin also waiting never said anything bickley child present servant knowledge feared future believing non existent careless strenuous hour life end felt yonder lay true future yes true past even though discover must pass portal know death 
reached mouth cave 
vast place perhaps arch hundred feet high could see arch adorned sculptures 
protected overhanging rock sculptured mouth cave cut deep mountain face still worn impossible discern details 
time eaten away like acid 
length time could guess must stupendous worked thus upon hard sheltered rock 
came home added force subsequent examination learned entire mouth cave sealed unnumbered ages

markings mountain side obvious something sort happened recently rate eastern face 
either flat rock sunk volcano thrown upwards 
far past cave found 
gone way table rock entirely sealed entrance 
entrance open although course break grooves spoken ran cave slightly different level lay upon flat rock 
yet although thus sheltered great stone curtain front still sculptures worn away tooth time 
course however may happened buried ancient cataclysm thus resurrected hour arrival upon island 
without pausing make closer examination crumbled carvings entered yawning mouth great place following indeed walking deep grooves mentioned 
presently seemed open courtyard might end passage yes open vast place whereof gloom could see roof limits

bickley said nothing overcome 
bastin remarked ever go olympia see kind play people said nothing ran dressed 
told religious sort thing clergyman study

nothing particular except nuns babies fact advertised

due course produced 
took possession valuable left charge bastin extracting box packet lit two candles short thick variety like used carriage lamps 
presently burned making two faint stars light however strong enough show us either roof sides vast place 
aid pursued path still following grooves till suddenly came end 
around us flat floor rock perceived clearly pushed aside dust gathered thickly course ages doubtless gradual disintegration stony walls polished till resembled black marble 
indeed certain cracks floor appeared filled dark colored cement 
stood looking bickley wandered right little forward presently called 
walked bastin sticking close candle little dog tommy like new surroundings would leave heels 
look said bickley holding candle tell faintly shown curious structure gleaming rods made yellowish metal rods appeared connected wires 
structure might forty feet high perhaps hundred long

could nothing metal skeletons felt must find beyond 
presently saw something looming ahead quickened pace recoil 
thirty feet away perhaps three hundred yards mouth cave suddenly appeared looked like gigantic man 
tommy saw also barked dogs frightened sound yaps echoed endlessly every quarter scared silence

great heavens madness said bickley 
great heavens answered slowly many things poor man would think madness yet truth perfect wisdom

said bickley 
interrupted bastin 
think lady remarks quite reasonable

would wallowing bed idleness shirking duty work 
also tells bickley half clever think silly scepticism doubt many things worlds would expose ignorance could see 
moment oro turned called daughter 
went saying come strangers shall learn

however made difference since circumstances something manner convinced spoke absolute truth 
daughter asleep two hundred fifty thousand years 
oh heavens two hundred fifty thousand years chapter xiii 
oro speaks bastin argues reader written ever person may find record marvelous therefore rashly conclude beyond experience could 
wise deduction think bickley would admit today without doubt many things surpass extremely limited experience

accident bickley return recovered temper since impossible anyone remain angry lady yva long spent happy time together 
instructed humble pupil 
swift nimble intelligence one morning learned alphabet write letters

journals since news arrived telepathically form wireless proclaimed cared listen formed judgments 
way poems even romances repeated homer day time norse sagas word mouth 
none secret knowledge written 
like ritual freemasonry considered sacred 
moreover men lived hundreds years necessary especially great fear lest fall hands outside nations called barbarians 
remembered sons wisdom always small people ruled weight intelligence strength accumulated lore 
indeed could scarcely called people rather families less connected original ruling dynasty considered half divine 
families waited upon multitude servants slaves drawn subject nations part skilled one art another perhaps remarkable personal beauty 
still remained outside pale 
sons wisdom intermarry teach learning even allow drink life water 
ruled men rule dogs treating kindness many dogs run course die lifetime one master many slaves one sons wisdom 
therefore slaves came regard lords men gods 
lived three score years ten like rest us went way whose great great grandfathers served master whose great great great grandchildren would still serve

old oro tough proposition despair yet besides glittering lady open minded person yet real opportunity approaching spiritual sense 
natives learn without teacher 
whole think would rather stay providence points path 
opinion somewhat different reasons said 
suppose often fortune men come touch things found upon island 
may illusions least interesting illusions 
one might live ten lifetimes find nothing else sort 
therefore like see end dream 
bickley reflected little said whole agree 
brain totters terribly afraid madness 
believe seem hear see way madness lies 
better die go mad 
anyway time comes bickley mean decease course interrupted bastin 
knows perhaps opportunity given providence open eyes must say singularly blind 
think know everything learn fact like rest us know nothing good man though obstinately refuse admit truth seek support elsewhere 
part believe afraid falling love glittering lady convinced wrong unsatisfactory conclusions 
voted anyway said bickley rest bastin look leave alone 
add whole think right wisest us stop die

worth learning long life indeed anything well solomon asked question ages since could give answer save vanity 
noted time yva began grow sad troubled indeed looking suddenly two three occasions saw beautiful eyes aswim tears 
also noted always grew sadder became sense human 
beginning far away 
one could never forget child alien race whose eyes looked upon world comparison humanity young times indeed might denizen another planet strayed earth 
although never flaunted one felt simplest word hid secret wisdom books open could read

even make use wondrous beauty madden men might well done minded 
true bastin bickley fell love must love told might fashion soreness left behind

chapter xxii 
command think bastin bickley instinct knew passed yva promised 
showed way avoided mention name 
also began talk plans future matters part 
thus heard discussing possibility escape island whereof suddenly seemed grown weary whether means two men two three could manage sail steer lifeboat remained upon wreck 
short cases woman come also pressure common loss caused forget differences draw closer together 
succeeded failed seemed think lives much ancient intimacy ended 
attitude hurt perhaps many respects situation awkward 
true taken failures extremely well still fact remained fallen love wonderful creature woman yet woman bound 
could go living together prospective possession object desired without pale moreover jealous another quite different fashion loved ways convinced hitherto loved henceforward affection left spare since surely glittering lady marvel wisdom physical perfections would take

still thought 
mastering situation reflected little spoke straight 
friends said see guessed yva affianced love perfectly 
yes arbuthnot said bastin saw face bade us good night went cave congratulate wish every happiness 
wish every happiness old fellow chimed bickley 
paused added honest sure congratulate 
bickley reason may suspect arbuthnot mean lost expected would account something totally different 
told ago repetition useless painful 
need add therefore since conviction strengthened sure sorry say matter must prepare disappointment calamity 
woman woman really never wife mortal man 
angry like laugh right seeing like bastin also asked marry something makes speak believe truth

yes like cassandra popular person 
first inclined resent bickley words would circumstances sudden rushed upon mind conviction spoke truth

yes answered absorbed principles told much 
sacrifice instance spoke word eyes filled tears 
sacrifice broke bickley angry snort needed vent mental disturbance 
rubbish 
every religion demand sacrifice savages alone stand condemned

therefore admit bastin equals though bickley like believes nothing common chemist doctor disease 
bow faith oro yes think god fate also bows faith 
perhaps indeed faith shapes fate fate faith

recognizing oro went wagged tail curled feet 
bastin believed story readily enough saying oro peculiar person doubt ways coming going understand 
point however least wish visit nyo 
wonders underground palaces temples charms 
also think could good going since sucking dry orange reference religious matters old vampire bat oro thrown away like rind might add seemed better juice absorbed 
doubt continued bastin whether st paul could converted oro even performed miracles 
use showing miracles man could always work bigger one short bastin one idea bickley also matter get away main island thence escape means boat fashion 
pointed oro said must obey peril lives indeed put even strongly using words effect would kill us 
take risk said bickley since believe dreamt arbuthnot 
however putting aside natural reason wish go part way 
want see old fellow extremely long sleeve anything 
well ask bickley answered believe destruction half earth little matter sort 
suggestion bickley snorted bastin said cheerfully dare say 
bad enough even 
quite convinced never allowed intentions trouble 
remarked seemed carried 
oh mean deluge 
well doubt deluge sure oro think said already 
anyhow impossible leave descend hole alone 
suggest therefore go sepulchre time believe oro appointed see happens 
mistaken glittering lady come fetch us since quite certain work lift whatever alone 
mistaken go back bed usual 
yes best plan said bickley shortly conversation came end 
day next watched waited vain coming yva yva appeared 
even went far sepulchre empty two crystal coffins waiting returned 
although say bickley evident oro said determined cut communication us 
second day drew close 
simple preparations complete 
consisted mainly making ready hurricane lamps packing little food enough keep us three four days necessary together matches good supply oil since bastin put determined caught like foolish virgins parable 
see added one never knows might please old wretch turn incandescent gas electric light whatever uses illumine family catacombs would awkward oil 
matter might steal lamps suggested bickley case moses light went 
considered possibility answered bastin therefore although dangerous weapon carry loaded determined take revolver 
necessary shall consider quite justified shooting save lives thousands others 
laughed somehow idea bastin trying shoot oro struck us intensely ludicrous 
yet thing happen 
peculiarly beautiful sunset southern seas 
west great flaming orb sank ocean east appeared silver circle full moon 
excited fancy like scales hanging hand materialised spirit calm 
volcano lake island palm trees seas beyond calm brooded 
save traveling birds sky empty cloud disturbed peace world seemed steeped innocence quiet 
things struck think others action simultaneous thought came minds probably looking last time 
well talk unknown infinite whereof assured heirs make easier us part known finite 
contemplation wonders eternity conceal advantages actual existent time 
short one us sainted archbishop sinful suicide regret necessity farewell pleasant light kindly race men wherewith acquainted 
quite certain beyond may splendid probably strange strangeness certain age shrink 
know things different human relationships utterly changed perhaps sex shapes many vanish replaced something unknown ambitions lose hold us best mere loss hopes fears leave us empty 
least think seek variation continuance since spirit must differ body thought alarms intelligence 
least us think others like bickley write future black endless night consolations since wisely suggested perhaps oblivion better memories 
others like bastin would say frenchman plus ca change plus c est la meme chose 
yet others like oro consider realm possibilities probably unpleasant perhaps non existent nothing 
one thing certain creature life desires leap fire dross doubts resolve gold lead certainty 
time going said bastin 
skies sun seems tumble set decently england wait longer shall late appointment sepulchre 
sorry although often notice scenery everything looks rather beautiful evening 
star instance think called venus 
therefore one arbuthnot admire broke bickley attempting lighten matters joke 
come let us rid fool errand 
certainly world lovely place part hope seen last added sigh 
said bastin though course faith teaches us much better ones beyond 
use bothering like hope road run hole old reprobate oro calls nyo 
minutes later started us carrying share impedimenta

even seems like oro gives creeps perhaps father 
dogs must charitable animals 
cave marching past wrecks half buried flying machines bickley remarked regretfully never found time thoroughly examine 
indeed would needed digging could without proper instruments since machines big deeply entombed dust 
came sepulchre entered 
well said bickley seating edge one coffins holding lamp look place seems fairly empty 
one keeping assignation arbuthnot although sun well

seemed though wondering circumstances might would arise secret fashion half conscious drawing answer soul 
turned smiling dazzling way said bickley usual believe see therefore lord oro father never spoke humphrey 
though lord oro could pass without knowledge perchance send thoughts clothed shape work errand 
know believe arbuthnot story bickley asked rather cross voice avoiding direct issue 
also send thoughts work errands clothed shape lady yva alas though perhaps could might 
simple bickley 
standing heard say although sun well one meet humphrey expected words voice guessed rest
