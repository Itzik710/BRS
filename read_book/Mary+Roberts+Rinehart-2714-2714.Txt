grim gray little old house concealed behind walled garden full unexpected charm 
like chancellor 
study ground floor overlooking garden chancellor spent leisure hours 
broad desk like arm chair many state documents lain signature meals served 
free ghosts haunted upper rooms dreamed dream greater kingdom 
mathilde kept house mended pressed uniforms washed starched linen quarreled orderly attended drove bed night 
midnight would say firmly one clock even later chancellor old needed little sleep

also something like karl words 
hedwig reflected bitterness everybody knew nobody helped 
answer thought olga loschek came plainly 
highness said may speak frankly please hedwig replied 
everybody anyhow 
especially something disagreeable 
olga loschek watched warily
