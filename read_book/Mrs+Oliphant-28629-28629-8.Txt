marriage many ways satisfactory young lady family mr beecham son respectable people good way business destitute means position one always felt suitable daughter almost may said brought 
however scarcely necessary add quite agreeable leading members congregation 
sorry say family wished preferment favorite daughter indeed doubt mrs pigeon asserted vigorously substantial grocer whose father established excellent business paid pew salem long one could recollect supported every charity paid occasions extra expense necessary every way desirable son law poor minister always dependent pleasing chapel folks might turn day 
notwithstanding however evident superiority establishment thus attained maria pigeon certain something attached position clerical caste even among independent body congregation salem chapel especial charms neither young people companions old people patronized snubbed felt satisfaction seeing phoebe thus advanced honors glories inalienable position minister wife 
little airs bridal vanity considered many offensive manifestations delight exultation rise life 
trousseau though pronounced competent judges half abundant fine maria pigeon still called forth comments nobody ventured indulge respect grocer blooming bride 
grocer lady right anything parents afford see minister wife swelling trying ape quality filled town virtuous indignation 
sight young mrs beecham walking card case hand calling miss hemmingses shaking hands mrs rider doctor wife caused unmitigated disgust throughout back streets carlingford phoebe sweeping chapel belonged almost oldest sitter could bear 
phoebe must added felt elevation full spare congregation 
sometimes would audacity walk vestry pew office bearer instead coming humbly door became woman 
would sit still ostentatiously every one gone waiting husband 
quite led singing everybody remarked paying attention choir exist even paused way seat turned gas blazing high air proprietorship nobody could endure 
salem belong tozers like know said mrs brown 
brown would never outdone subscriptions may sure mr pigeon neither truth known 
never gave money build castle tozers 
thus whole congregation expressed less eloquence though attendance never diminished everybody anxious see would next feeling could ignored 
phoebe courage developed moment marriage took initiative 
never answers said solemnly marry one flock knew henery told would infatuated marry told interests jealous pet said mr beecham laughed 
could bear annoyance consideration sweet consciousness cause stole 
phoebe laughed delicious gratification 
felt people even salem might jealous 
end must stay said 
must find another sphere talents henery sure difficult 
get put deputation going north suppose take best sermons dear 
never harm indeed sure good poor benighted soul least perhaps never heard truth 
likewise perhaps vacant congregation 
always heard chapels north superior 
different class society better altogether 
pigeons browns people sort society 
well truth said mr beecham pulling shirt collar 
certainly sort thing one accustomed 
lent serious ear suggestion sermons 
consequence invitation followed chapel north indeed mrs phoebe found much finer society grew rapidly importance ideas 
favourable start process went many years young man homerton developed influential highly esteemed pastor important flock 
things may probably differently managed days 
mr beecham unbounded fluency unctuous manner treating subjects 
eloquence kind though elevated kind 
never loss say prodigious advantage men positions doubly popular minister 
unbounded wealth phraseology 
sentences seemed melt mouth without apparent effort set certain cadence 
perhaps much power thought easy make secondary want gift expression strong 
mr beecham rose like actor long successful career provinces might called surrey side congregational eminence london thence attained final apotheosis handsome chapel near regent park built whitest stone cushioned reddest damask large congregation sat great comfort listened sermons satisfaction doubt increased fact cushions soft easy chairs carpets hot water pipes kept everything snug foot 
comfortable chapel whole connection 
seats arranged like amphitheatre line slightly higher level one front everybody saw everything going 
dimness mystery wanted everything bright daylight bright paint red cushions comfort respectability 
might place well adapted saying prayers could say prayers home place admirably adapted hearing sermons could home arrangements could hear greatest comfort say luxury 
wonder part poor folk seize upon crescent chapel cold sunday mornings make happy warm ruddy pews 
would little amusing speculate well dressed pew holders would done unexpected answer appeal mr beecham believed make every sunday world general literally given 
would extremely embarrassing managing committee office bearers would fear deeply exasperated offended occupants family pews fortunately difficulty never occur 
proletariat marylebone sense courage profanity hit upon mode warming 
real congregation embraced none unwashed multitude 
value mere velvet silk lace trinkets furs something amazing amount comfortable people represented way income would amounted princely revenue 
little salems bethesdas humble flocks could supposed belong species difference almost equally marked place worship crescent chapel parish churches like nets gospel take kinds fish bad good 
pew holders crescent chapel universally well subscribed liberally missionary societies far liberally people st paul close p g everything best chapel houses 
economized minister pew cushions spent amount money choir made singing people st paul gnash teeth 
seen atmosphere crescent chapel distinct individual kind 
warm luxurious air perfumy breathing refinement possible mere wealth 
say might true refinement besides surface kind buy upholsterers tailors dressmakers procure ready made schools kept high cost abounded pervaded place 
badly dressed people felt place brilliant sanctuary muddy footprint upon thick matting passages looked crime 
clean dry feet issuing carriage cab kept aisles unstained even wettest day 
say cab many people went crescent chapel objected take carriages work horses sunday many though possess carriages used cabs freedom incompatible poverty 
general rule much better people st paul universally prosperous well 
time might safely call well informed people people read newspapers sometimes magazines knew going

began life feeling hopelessly low social caste believing superior superiors enlightenment brought believe distinguished connection 
first thing opened minds dawning doubt whether enlightenment reality much greater neighbors social change worked position removal carlingford 
great towns north dissent attains highest social elevation chapel people longer distinguished church people except fact go chapel instead church definition simple quite overwhelming unprepared dissenting intelligence brought little tory borough still holding church queen 
amazing difference made sentiments mrs phoebe beecham n e tozer quite impossible describe

country parishes people awakened dirty work us dear brother dirty work 
sentiments shared perhaps warmly mr beecham congregation hot voluntaries gave ministers little trouble 
part took nonconformity quietly satisfied know chapel first connection minister justly esteemed one eloquent 
liberation society held one meeting crescent chapel considered great success 
best lukewarm crescent chapelites political dissenters 
minister people liberal creed professed
