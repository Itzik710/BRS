chapter ii 
ragnall castle finished reading amazing document lit pipe set work think 
hypothetical inquirer might ask thought amazing 
nothing odd dilettante englishman highly cultivated mind taking egyptology chanced one richest men kingdom spending fraction wealth excavating temples 
strange happened die accident engaged pursuit imagine fascinating delightful winter climate egypt

spent instructive two hours museum studying various egyptian antiquities including couple mummies rather terrified 
looked corpse like standing wrappings 
one lady singer amen remember 
wondered singing song 
presently came glass case riveted attention label bearing following words two papyri given lady ragnall priests kendah tribe africa 
within papyri unrolled beneath documents translation far could translated somewhat broken 
dated first year peroa appeared official appointment royal lady amada prophetess temple isis horus child also called amada situated east bank nile thebes 
evidently temple lady ragnall written letter husband met death accident coincidence made start remembered document come hands kind office filled time 
second papyrus rather translation contained comprehensive curse upon man ventured interfere personal sanctity royal lady amada apparently virtue office doomed perpetual celibacy like vestal virgins 
remember terms curse know invoked vengeance isis mother lady moon horus child upon anyone dare desecration many words doomed death violence far country first looked ra ie sun also certain spiritual sufferings afterwards 
document gave idea composed troubled days protect particularly sacred person prophetess isis whose cult since learned rising egypt time threatened danger perhaps hands foreign man 
occurred even princess evidently descendant kings appointed sacred office purpose 
men shrink little often fear incur direct curse widely venerated gods order obtain desires even gods 
conclusions curious ancient writing regret give full neglected copy time 
may add seemed extremely strange dealt particular temple egypt passed lady ragnall hands two thousand years later distant part africa subsequently husband killed presence whilst excavating temple referred whence probability taken 
moreover oddly enough lady ragnall filled r le isis shrine whereof two papyri part sacred appurtenances unknown ages one official titles prophetess lady moon whose symbol wore upon breast 
although always recognized great many things world dreamt philosophy say truth confidence superstitious man 
yet confess papers circumstances connected made feel afraid 
also made wish come ragnall castle

still oil use without lamp soul without body least underneath sun taught worship grasshopper 
master came back hunting happened found bes lady amada acquired learning possible taken first vows isis said would break man earth although might done without crime 
therefore although dear brother would one swore never even thought another man refused much think marrying dreamed heavenly perfections lady isis 
ump said bes 
ethiopians priestesses grasshopper grasshopper wife think like 
hope one day something stronger cause lady amada break vows heavenly isis 
perhaps may sake another man go east account fool talk 
village horses spent 
let us stop eat suppose even lady amada sometimes 
following afternoon crossed nile towards sunset entered vast ancient city memphis 
white walls floated banners great king bes pointed saying wherever went whole world seemed could never free accursed symbols 
may live spit upon cast moat answered savagely drew near amada grew ten times hateful 
truth nearer amada thought passed enclosure temple ptah wonderful mightiest whole world came temple isis 
near pylon gate met procession priests priestesses advancing offer evening sacrifice song flowers clad robes purest white

priests came meet us pushing colossal image god kind flat chariot remember wondering would value huge golden locust melted 
also council came ancient men since ethiopians part lived hundred years 
perhaps glad welcome bes since old care retaining power hands done long absence 
save bes man living true royal blood could take throne 
thousands women broad faced smiling whose black skins shone scented oils wore little except girdle waists many ornaments gold 
thus earrings sometimes palm breadth many great gold rings noses egypt put bulls 
mother laughed karema said thought hideous hateful 
strange people ethiopians like children merry kind never thinking one thing minute 
thus one would see weep laugh almost breath 
among upper class great learning much ancient knowledge 
men made laws wherein always sense seemed folly designed temples managed mines gold metals followed arts 
real masters land rest slaves content live plenty fertile soil want never came near bid 
thus passed cradle grave amidst song flowers carrying light allotted tasks rest living would loving would especially children many 
nature tradition men warriors hunters skilled use bow always war could find anyone fight 
indeed came among trouble enemies left implored bes lead battle since weary herding kine tilling fields 
things found degrees also great people could send army seventy thousand men yet leave enough behind defend land 
world beyond borders knew little learned men spoken great deal since traveled egypt elsewhere study customs countries

due course however child came proved son black best perfect shape relented towards birth second grew love 
never forgave loved 
fond children black said showed poisonous blood ethiopians 
indeed often noticed ethiopian weds one another color offspring black third fourth generation 
therefore karema longed egypt notwithstanding splendor dwelt 
greatly long recourse magic lore learned holy tanofir would sit hours gazing water crystal bowl sometimes ball crystal without water trying see visions therein passed egypt 
moreover time much gift returned see many things repeated would tell one else even husband 
thus saw amada kneeling shrine statue isis weeping picture made sad

since must go foot able cover five leagues day even reached river boats could found many though karema traveled one ladies 
also cattle corn must always sent forward food 
still crept egypt without sickness accident revolt 
drew near frontiers messengers met us pharaoh bearing letters answer sent tidings coming
