things reached state incident occurred excited general interest hundred fold 
frenchman paris michel ardan name eccentric keen shrewd well daring demanded atlantic telegraph permission enclosed bullet might carried moon curious make certain investigations 
received america great enthusiasm ardan held great meeting triumphantly carried point reconciled barbican mortal foe certain captain nicholl even way clinching reconciliation induced newly made friends join contemplated trip moon 
bullet modified become hollow conical cylinder plenty room inside provided powerful water springs readily ruptured partitions floor intended deaden dreadful concussion sure accompany start

everything last ready 
december st appointed moment midst immense concourse spectators departure took place first time world history three human beings quitted terrestrial globe possibility favor finally reaching point destination inter planetary spaces 
expected accomplish journey hours minutes seconds consequently reaching lunar surface precisely midnight december exact moment moon would full 
unfortunately instantaneous explosion vast quantity gun cotton giving rise violent commotion atmosphere generated much vapor mist render moon invisible several nights innumerable watchers western hemisphere vainly tried catch sight 
meantime jt marston secretary gun club devoted friend barbican started long peak colorado summit immense telescope already alluded erected reflecting kind possessed power sufficient bring moon within distance five miles 
marston prosecuting long journey possible speed professor belfast charge telescope endeavoring catch glimpse projectile long time success 
hazy cloudy weather lasted week great disgust public large 
people even began fear observation would deferred following month january latter half december waning moon could possibly give light enough render projectile visible 
last however unbounded satisfaction violent tempest suddenly cleared sky th december shortly midnight moon verging towards last quarter revealed sharp bright dark background starry firmament 
morning hours marston arrival summit long peak remarkable telegram dispatched professor belfast smithsonian institute washington 
announced december th clock morning projectile shot stony hill perceived professor belfast assistants deflected little course unknown cause reached mark though approached near enough affected lunar attraction rectilineal motion become circular henceforth continue describe regular orbit around moon fact become satellite 
dispatch went state elements new heavenly body yet calculated least three different observations taken different times necessary determine 
distance projectile lunar surface however might set roughly roughly miles 
dispatch concluded following hypotheses positively pronounced two possible either lunar attraction would finally prevail case travellers would reach destination projectile kept whirling forever immutable orbit would go revolving around moon till time 
either alternative lot daring adventurers true abundant provisions last time even supposing reach moon thereby completely establish practicability daring enterprise ever get back could ever get back ever even heard questions nature freely discussed ablest pens day kept public mind restless excited condition

chapter pm 
moment great clock belonging works stony hill struck ten barbican ardan nicholl began take last farewells numerous friends surrounding 
two dogs intended accompany already deposited projectile 
three travellers approached mouth enormous cannon seated flying car took leave last time vast throng standing silence around 
windlass creaked car started three daring men disappeared yawning gulf 
trap hole giving ready access interior projectile car soon came back empty great windlass presently rolled away tackle scaffolding removed short space time great mouth columbiad completely rid obstructions 
nicholl took upon fasten door trap inside means powerful combination screws bolts invention 
also covered carefully glass lights strong iron plates extreme solidity tightly fitting joints 
ardan first care turn gas found burning rather low lit one burner desirous economize much possible store light heat well knew could utmost last longer weeks 
cheerful blaze interior projectile looked like comfortable little chamber circular sofa nicely padded walls dome shaped ceiling 
articles contained arms instruments utensils etc solidly fastened projections wadding sustain least injury possible first terrible shock 
fact precautions possible humanly speaking taken counteract first possibly one greatest dangers courageous adventurers would exposed 
ardan expressed quite pleased appearance things general 
prison sure said one ordinary prisons always keep one spot 
part long privilege looking window willing lease hundred years 
ah barbican brings one stony smiles 
think lease may last longer tenement may become coffin eh 
prefer anyway mahomet may indeed float air motionless milestone illustration turn gas 
barbican made sure personal inspection everything perfect order consulted chronometer carefully set short time chief engineer murphy charged fire projectile 
friends said twenty minutes past ten 
precisely murphy send electric current gun cotton 
therefore twenty six minutes remain earth 
twenty six minutes twenty seconds observed captain nicholl always aimed mathematical precision 
twenty six minutes cried ardan gaily 
age cycle according use make 
twenty six minutes much done weightiest questions warfare politics morality discussed even decided twenty six minutes 
twenty six minutes well spent infinitely valuable twenty six lifetimes wasted seconds even employed pascal newton barbican profoundly intellectual whose thoughts wander eternity mad marston every bit muttered captain half audibly 
conclude rigmarole interrupted barbican 
conclude twenty six good minutes still left twenty four minutes ten seconds interrupted captain watch hand 
well twenty four minutes captain ardan went even twenty four minutes maintain ardan interrupted barbican little shall plenty time philosophical disputations 
let us think something far pressing 
pressing mean fully prepared yes fully prepared far least able foresee 
may still think possibly increase number precautions taken terrible shock soon experience 
doubts whatever effectiveness brilliant extremely original idea think layers water regularly disposed easily ruptured partitions beneath floor afford us sufficient protection elasticity hope indeed dear friend means confident 
hopes means confident listen mac pretty time tell us let late observed captain quietly 
trap hole alone would take ten fifteen minutes open 
oh suppose must make best said ardan laughing 
aboard gentlemen train starts twenty minutes nineteen minutes eighteen seconds said captain never took eye chronometer 
three travellers looked little even ardan appeared become serious 
another careful glance several objects lying around barbican said quietly everything place except 
decide position must take order neutralize shock much possible 
must particularly careful guard rush blood head 
correct said captain 
suppose stood heads like circus tumblers cried ardan ready suit action word 
better said barbican lie side 
keep clearly mind dear friends instant departure makes little difference us whether inside bullet front 
doubt difference added seeing great eyes made friends exceedingly little 
thank heaven interrupted ardan fervently 
approve suggestion captain asked barbican 
certainly hasty reply 
say absolutely 
seventeen minutes twenty seven seconds mac human cried ardan admiringly 
repeating chronometer horizontal escapement london made lever capped jewelled companions let run busied making last arrangements greatest coolness systematic method 
fact think anything compare except couple old travellers pass night train trying make comfortable possible long journey 
profound astonishment may naturally ask strange material hearts americans made view without slightest semblance flutter approach appalling dangers curiosity fully participate sorry say gratify 
one things could never find 
three mattresses thick well wadded spread disc forming false bottom projectile arranged lines whose parallelism simply perfect 
ardan would never think occupying last moment 
walking restless nervousness wild beast cage kept continuous fire talk one moment friends another dogs addressing latter euphonious suggestive names diana satellite 
illustration diana satellite 
ho pets would exclaim patted gently must forget noble part play 
must models canine deportment 
eyes whole selenitic world upon 
standard bearers race 
receive first impression regarding merits 
let favorable one 
compel selenites acknowledge spite terrestrial race canines far superior best moon dog among dogs moon sneered nicholl like plenty dogs cried ardan horses cows sheep end chickens hundred dollars one single chicken within whole lunar realm excluding even invisible side cried captain authoritative tone never taking eye chronometer 
take bet son coolly replied ardan shaking captain hand way ratifying wager reminds way mac lost three bets already pretty little tune six thousand dollars 
paid cried captain monotonously ten thirty six six yes quarter hour pay nine thousand dollars four thousand columbiad burst five thousand projectile rise six miles earth 
money ready answered captain touching breeches pocket 
lose pay 
sooner 
ten thirty eight ten captain man method ever one 
think however made mistake wagers 
asked captain listlessly eye still dial 
jove win left take money barbican pay friend ardan quietly observed barbican stakes deposited wall street bank new york orders pay captain heirs case captain fail put appearance proper time 
oh rhinoceroses pachyderms granite men cried ardan gasping surprise machines iron heads iron hearts may admire blessed understand ten forty two ten repeated nicholl mechanically chronometer spoke 
four minutes half said barbican 
oh four half little minutes went ardan 
think shut bullet lies chamber cannon nine hundred feet long 
underneath bullet piled charge thousand pounds gun cotton equivalent thousand pounds ordinary gunpowder instant friend murphy chronometer hand eye dial finger discharger counting last seconds getting ready launch us limitless regions planetary ardan dear friend interrupted barbican grave tone serious moment hand 
let us meet interior recollection 
give hands dear friends 
certainly said ardan tears voice already extreme apparent levity 
three brave men united one last silent warm impulsively affectionate pressure 
great god creator protect us thee trust prayed barbican others joining folded hands bowed heads 
ten forty six whispered captain ardan quietly took places mattresses 
forty seconds barbican rapidly extinguishes gas lies beside companions 
deathlike silence reigning projectile interrupted sharp ticking chronometer beats seconds 
suddenly dreadful shock felt projectile shot instantaneous development millions cubic feet gas flying space inconceivable rapidity chapter ii 
first half hour 
taken place within projectile effect produced frightful concussion barbican ingenuity attended fortunate result shock sufficiently deadened springs buffers water layers partitions readily ruptured combined effect succeeded counteracting tremendous violence velocity yards second actually sufficient carry london new york six minutes hundred questions similar nature asked night millions watching explosion base stony hill 
forgot altogether moment forgot everything absorbing anxiety regarding fate daring travellers 
one among friend marston instance favored glimpse interior projectile would seen nothing first account darkness except walls solidly resisted frightful shock 
crack bend dent could perceived even slightest injury admirably constructed piece mechanical workmanship endured 
yielded inch enormous pressure far melting falling back earth seriously apprehended showers blazing aluminium still strong every respect day left cold spring iron works glittering like silver dollar 
real damage actually none even disorder things thrown interior violent shock comparatively slight 
small objects lying around loose furiously hurled ceiling others appeared suffered slightest injury 
straps fastened unfrayed fixtures held uncracked 
partitions beneath disc ruptured water escaped false floor dashed tremendous violence bottom projectile disc moment three human bodies could seen lying perfectly still motionless 
three corpses projectile suddenly become great metallic coffin bearing ghastly contents air rapidity lightning flash minutes shock one bodies stirred little arms moved eyes opened head rose tried look around finally difficulty body managed get knees 
frenchman held head tightly squeezed hands time keep splitting 
felt rapidly cleared throat vigorous hem listened sound critically instant said relieved tone native tongue one man right call roll others tried rise effort great strength 
fell back brain swimming eyes bursting head splitting 
state much resembled young man waking morning first tremendous spree 
br rr muttered still talking french reminds one wild nights long ago quartier latin decidedly lying quietly back could soon feel circulation blood suddenly violently arrested terrific shock gradually recovering regular flow heart grew normal action head became clearer pain less distracting 
time call roll last exclaimed voice pretensions firmness barbican macnicholl listens anxiously reply 
none comes 
snow wrapt grave midnight silent 
vain try catch even faintest sound breathing though listens intently enough hear beating hearts hears 
call roll mutters voice far less assured barbican macnicholl fearful unearthly stillness 
thing getting decidedly monotonous exclaimed still speaking french 
rapidly recovering consciousness full horror situation began break mind went muttering audibly really hopped twig bah fudge able knock life one little frenchman killed two americans right first foremost let us enlighten situation saying contrived without much difficulty get feet 
balancing moment began groping gas 
stopped suddenly 
hold minute cried lighting match let us see gas escaping 
setting fire mixture air hydrogen would make pretty explosion would infallibly burst projectile far seems right though blest tell whether moving 
began sniffing smelling discover possible odor escaped gas 
could detect slightest sign anything kind 
gave great courage 
knew course senses yet good order still thought might trust far certain gas escaped consequently receptacles uninjured 
touch match gas burst light burned steady flame 
ardan immediately bent anxiously prostrate bodies friends 
lay like inert masses nicholl stretched across barbican 
ardan first lifted captain laid sofa opened clenched hands rubbed slapped palms vigorously 
went body carefully kneading rubbing gently patting 
intelligent efforts restore suspended circulation seemed perfectly home minutes patience rewarded seeing captain pallid face gradually recover natural color feeling heart gradually beat firm pulsation 
last nicholl opened eyes stared ardan instant pressed hand looked around searchingly anxiously last whispered faint voice barbican barbican right captain answered ardan quietly still speaking french 
attend jiffy 
wait turn 
began top man 
see minute dear old barby ce cher barbican less thirty seconds captain able sit even insisted helping ardan lift barbican deposit gently sofa 
illustration helped ardan lift barbican 
poor president evidently suffered concussion either companions 
took coat first terribly shocked sight great patch blood staining shirt bosom inexpressibly relieved finding proceeded slight contusion shoulder little skin deep 
every approved operation ardan performed captain repeated barbican long time nothing like favorable result 
ardan first tried encourage captain whispers lively hopeful nature yet understanding nicholl deign make single reply grew reserved degrees last would speak single word 
worked barbican however 
nicholl interrupted every moment lay ear breast unconscious man 
first shaken head quite despondingly degrees found encouraged persist 
breathes whispered last 
yes breathing time replied ardan quietly still unconsciously speaking french 
little rubbing pulling pounding make spry young grasshopper 
worked fact vigorously intelligently perseveringly considered long hour labor delight seeing pale face assume healthy hue inert limbs give signs returning animation breathing become strong regular 
last barbican suddenly opened eyes started upright position sofa took friends hands voice showing complete consciousness demanded eagerly ardan nicholl moving friends looked little amused perplexed 
anxiety regarding friend recovery never thought asking question 
words recalled full sense situation 
moving blessed tell said ardan still speaking french 
may lying fifty feet deep florida marsh know observed nicholl 
likely bottom gulf mexico suggested ardan still french 
suppose find observed barbican jumping try voice clear step firm ever 
trying one thing finding another 
means comparing external objects could possibly tell whether moving absolute stand still 
though earth whirling us continually around sun tremendous speed miles minute inhabitants totally unconscious slightest motion 
travellers 
personal consciousness could tell absolutely nothing 
shooting space like meteor could tell 
fallen back buried deep sandy soil florida still likely hundreds fathoms deep beneath waters gulf mexico could form slightest idea 
listening evidently could good 
profound silence proved nothing 
padded walls projectile thick admit sound whether wind water human beings 
barbican however soon struck forcibly one circumstance 
felt uncomfortably warm friend faces looked hot flushed 
hastily removing cover protected thermometer closely inspected instant uttered joyous exclamation 
hurrah cried 
moving mistake 
thermometer marks degrees fahrenheit 
stifling heat could come gas 
comes exterior walls projectile atmospheric friction must made almost red hot 
heat must soon diminish already far beyond regions atmosphere instead smothering shall shortly danger freezing 
asked ardan much bewildered 
already far beyond limits terrestrial atmosphere think nicholl still much flustered venture word 
want answer question satisfactorily dear ardan replied barbican quiet smile kindness put questions english 
mean barbican asked ardan hardly believing ears 
hurrah cried nicholl tone man suddenly made welcome unexpected discovery 
know exactly captain continued barbican utmost tranquillity part study languages never strong point though always admired french even understood pretty well never could converse without giving trouble always find convenient assume 
mean say talking french time cried ardan horror stricken 
elegant french ever heard backed purest parisian accent replied barbican highly amused think captain added turning nicholl whose countenance still showed comical traces bewilderment 
well swan man cried captain always swore little feelings got beyond control ardan boss got rig us time rough darned sight 
hanged think talking english whole time put whole blame understanding disordered state brain ardan stared scratched head barbican actually laughed serene nature could laugh 
cast iron features puckered smile richest drollery eyes twinkled wickedest fun undignified giggle escaped portal majestic lips 
sounds like french say continued captain know english whirring goes head shall easily understand 
ardan looked beginning see joke 
puzzling part thing went nicholl giving experience utmost gravity english sounded like french 
simple incomprehensible gibberish could readily blame state ears 
idea bothered ears could turn mere confused muzzled buzzing reverberation sweet harmonious articulate though unintelligible human language made sure fast becoming crazy already 
ha ha ha roared ardan laughing till tears came 
understand poor captain made reply time looked hapless woe begone expression countenance 
fact barbican shock much nicholl 
man among us whose head fire proof blast proof powder proof 
really believe burglar would greater difficulty blowing head piece open bursting one famous american safes papers make fuss 
wonderful head boss nicholl yes said captain slowly every word gem profoundest thought boss fearful wonderful head business cried versatile ardan think barbican present beyond limits terrestrial atmosphere simple reason said barbican pointing chronometer seven minutes 
must therefore motion twenty minutes 
consequently unless initial velocity much diminished friction must long completely cleared fifty miles atmosphere enveloping earth 
correct said captain cool cucumber complete possession senses much think initial velocity diminished friction third according calculations replied barbican think right 
supposing initial velocity therefore yards per second time quitted atmosphere must reduced yards per second 
rate must gone time mac boy lost two bets interrupted ardan 
columbiad burst four thousand dollars projectile risen least six miles five thousand dollars come captain bleed let first sure right said captain quietly 
deny see friend barbican arguments quite right therefore lost nine thousand dollars 
another view case possible might annul bet 
view asked barbican quickly 
suppose said captain drily powder caught still lying quietly bottom columbiad jove laughed ardan idea truly worthy nondescript brain must surely changed heads concussion matter sense left us yet 
come captain consider little 
half killed shock rescue certain death two hands see barbican shoulder still bleeding violence shock correct friend michael correct every particular replied captain one little question 
friend michael say moving yes 
consequence explosion certainly must attended tremendous report course hear report friend michael n replied ardan little disconcerted question 
well say hear report 
friend barbican replied barbican promptly 
heard report whatever 
answer ready look quite disconcerted ardan well friend barbican friend michael said captain drily leered wickedly put together tell make 
fact exclaimed barbican puzzled bewildered 
hear report hard said ardan 
give three friends gazed countenances expressive much perplexity 
barbican appeared least self possessed party 
complete turning tables state things moments ago 
problem certainly simple enough reason inexplicable 
moving explosion must taken place explosion taken place heard report barbican decision soon put end speculation 
conjecture useless said let us recourse facts 
first let us see 
drop deadlights operation simple enough immediately undertaken whole three easily accomplished 
screws fastening bolts external plates deadlights solidly pinned readily yielded pressure powerful wrench 
bolts driven outwards holes contained immediately filled solid plugs india rubber 
bolts driven external plates dropped weight turning hinge like portholes strong plate glass forming light immediately showed 
second light exactly similar could cleared away opposite side projectile third summit dome fourth center bottom 
travellers could thus take observations four different directions opportunity gazing firmament side lights earth moon lower upper lights projectile 
ardan captain commenced examining floor previous operating bottom light 
barbican first get work one side lights nicholl ardan soon heard shouting friends exclaimed tones decided emotion fallen back earth lying bottom gulf mexico 
driving space look stars glittering around brighter smaller ever seen left earth earth atmosphere far behind us hurrah hurrah cried nicholl ardan feeling electric shocks coursing though could see nothing looking side light blackest profoundest obscurity 
barbican soon convinced pitchy blackness proved could reposing surface earth moment everything illuminated bright moonlight also passed different layers atmosphere diffused refracted rays would also sure reveal lights projectile 
therefore certainly moving 
doubt longer possible 
fact observed captain quite convinced 
lost let congratulate cried ardan shaking hand 
nine thousand dollars friend barbican said captain taking roll greenbacks high denomination porte monnaie 
want receipt captain asked barbican counting money 
yes prefer one much trouble answered nicholl saves dispute 
coolly mechanically seated desk office barbican opened memorandum book wrote receipt blank page dated signed sealed handed captain put away carefully among papers portfolio 
ardan taking hat made profound bow companions without saying word 
formality extraordinary circumstances actually paralysed tongue moment 
wonder could understand americans 
even indians would surprised exhibition stoicism 
indulging silent wonder minute two joined companions busy looking starry sky 
moon asked 
see fact seeing answered barbican gives great satisfaction one respect shows projectile shot rapidly columbiad time impressed slightest revolving motion us fortunate matter 
rest see cassiopeia little left andromeda great square pegasus southwest fomalhaut easily seen swallowing cascade 
shows looking west consequently see moon approaching zenith east 
open light hold look three travellers looking westwardly direction alpherat saw brilliant object rapidly approaching 
distance looked like dusky moon side turned towards earth blazed bright light every moment became intense 
came towards prodigious velocity worse path lay directly course projectile collision seemed inevitable 
moved onward west east could easily see rotated axis like heavenly bodies fact somewhat resembled moon small scale describing regular orbit around earth 
mille tonerres cried ardan greatly excited another projectile nicholl wiping spectacles looked made reply 
barbican looked puzzled uneasy 
collision quite possible results even frightful highest degree must extremely deplorable 
projectile absolutely dashed pieces would diverted course dragged along new one obedience irresistible attraction furious asteroid 
barbican fully realized either alternative involved complete failure enterprise 
kept perfectly still never losing presence mind curiously looked approaching object gladiatorial eye seeking detect unguarded point terrible adversary 
captain equally silent looked like man fully made mind regard every possible contingency stoical indifference 
ardan tongue fluent ever rattled away incessantly 
look look exclaimed tones perfectly expressive rapidly alternating feelings render medium words totally unnecessary 
rapidly cursed thing nearing us plague take ugly phiz know less like every second doubles size come madame projectile stir stumps little livelier old lady making straight arrow going right way coming say 
taking mean advantage us either way 
monster helpless three men little skiff shooting rapids brink niagara nearer nearer came without noise without sparks without trail though lower part brighter ever 
path lying little nearer came collision seemed inevitable 
imagine caught narrow railroad bridge midnight express train approaching full speed reflector already dazzling light roar cars rattling ears may conceive feelings travellers 
last near travellers started back affright eyes shut hair end fully believing last hour come 
even ardan mot 
neither switch brakes clap steam hard luck instant 
velocity projectile fortunately great enough carry barely dangerous point flash terrible bolide disappeared rapidly several hundred yards beneath affrighted travellers 
good bye may never come back cried ardan hardly able breathe 
perfectly outrageous room enough infinite space let unpretending bullet like move little without incurring risk run monster anyhow know barbican reply 
course know eh captain simple bolide one enormous dimensions earth attraction made satellite 
cried ardan another satellite besides moon hope pretty numerous replied barbican small move enormous velocity seldom seen 
petit director observatory toulouse last years devoted much time care observation bolides calculated one encountered moves astonishing swiftness accomplishes revolution around earth hours minutes whew whistled ardan struck us mean say barbican observed nicholl petit seen one appears replied barbican 
astronomers admit existence asked captain 
well doubts replied barbican unbelievers minute two ago interrupted ardan would never express doubt 
petit calculation right continued barbican even form good idea distance earth 
seems barbican pleases elsewhere observed ardan captain 
let us see barbican asked nicholl petit calculation placed us bolide distance known replied barbican moment met little thousand miles earth surface 
five thousand miles already cried ardan started let us see quietly observed captain looking chronometer calculating pencil 
minutes past eleven therefore minutes road 
supposing initial velocity yards nearly seven miles second kept time miles earth allowing friction gravity hardly miles 
yes friend barbican petit seem wrong calculations 
barbican hardly heard observation 
yet answered puzzling question already presented solution done could attend anything else 
well good captain replied absorbed manner yet able account strange phenomenon 
hear report one replying conversation came stand still barbican still absorbed reflections began clearing second light external shutter 
minutes plate dropped moon beams flowing filled interior projectile brilliant light 
captain immediately put gas motives economy well glare somewhat interfered observation interplanetary regions 
lunar disc struck travellers glittering splendor purity light never witnessed 
beams longer strained misty atmosphere earth streamed copiously glass coated interior walls projectile brilliant silvery plating 
intense blackness sky enhanced dazzling radiance moon 
even stars blazed new unequalled splendor absence refracting atmosphere flamed bright close proximity moon part sky 
easily conceive interest bold travellers gazed starry queen final object daring journey 
insensibly approaching zenith mathematical point reach four days later 
presented telescopes mountains plains craters general characteristics hardly came particle sharply viewed earth 
still light unobstructed air vapor shimmered lustre actually transplendent 
disc shone like mirror polished platins 
travellers remained time absorbed silent contemplation glorious scene 
gazing moment stony hill said captain last break silence 
jove cried ardan true captain right 
near forgetting dear old mother earth 
ungrateful children let feast eyes blessed old creature barbican satisfy companion desire immediately commenced clear away disc covered floor projectile prevented getting lower light 
disc though dashed bottom projectile great violence still strong ever made compartments fastened screws dismount easy matter 
barbican however help others soon taken apart put away pieces carefully serve case need 
round hole foot half diameter appeared bored floor projectile 
closed circular pane plate glass six inches thick fastened ring copper 
outside glass protected aluminium plate kept place strong bolts nuts 
latter unscrewed bolts slipped weight shutter fell new communication established interior exterior 
ardan knelt applied eye light tried look 
first everything quite dark gloomy 
see earth exclaimed last 
see fine ribbon light asked barbican right beneath us thin pale silvery crescent course 
earth terra mater friend ardan 
fine fillet light hardly visible eastern border disappear altogether soon moon full 
lying sun moon illuminated face turned away us altogether several days involved impenetrable darkness 
earth repeated ardan hardly able believe eyes continued gaze slight thread silvery white light somewhat resembling appearance young may moon hours sunset 
barbican explanation quite correct 
earth reference moon projectile last phase octant called showed sharp horned attenuated brilliant crescent strongly relieved black background sky 
light rendered little bluish density atmospheric envelopes quite brilliant moon earth crescent compared lunar dimensions much greater fully times larger 
would called vast beautiful thin bow extending sky 
points brighter rest particularly concave part revealed presence lofty mountains probably himalayahs 
disappeared every thick vapory spots never seen lunar disc 
thin concentric cloud rings surround terrestrial sphere 
however travellers eyes soon able trace rest earth surface facility even follow outline absolute delight 
consequence two different phenomena one could easily account could explain without barbican assistance 
wonder 
never mortal eye beheld sight 
let us take turn 
know ashy light means perceive called old moon young moon arms due earth shine reflection solar rays earth moon 
phenomenon exactly identical travellers could see portion earth surface unillumined sun consequence different areas respective surfaces earthlight thirteen times intense moonlight dark portion earth disc appeared considerably adumbrated old moon 
phenomenon burst suddenly uttered cry loud enough wake barbican problem 
discovered true starry ring around earth outline ring internally well defined thickness somewhat hazy outside could easily traced surpassing brilliancy 
neither pleiades northern crown magellanic clouds great nebulas orion argo sparkling cluster corona group glittering star dust travellers ever gazed presented attractions diamond ring saw encompassing earth brass meridian encompasses terrestrial globe 
resplendency light enchanted pure softness delighted perfect regularity astonished 
asked barbican 
words explained 
beautiful luminous ring simply optical illusion produced refraction terrestrial atmosphere 
stars neighborhood earth many actually behind rays refracted diffused radiated finally converged focus atmosphere double convex lens gigantic power 
whilst travellers profoundly absorbed contemplation wondrous sight sparkling shower shooting stars suddenly flashed earth dark surface making moment bright external ring 
hundreds bolides catching fire contact atmosphere streaked darkness luminous trails overspreading occasionally sheets electric flame 
earth perihelion know months november december highly favorable appearance meteoric showers famous display november astronomers counted many midnight four clock 
barbican explained whole matter words 
earth nearest sun occasionally plunges group countless meteors traveling like comets eccentric orbits around grand center solar system 
atmosphere strikes rapidly moving bodies violence set fire render visible us beautiful star showers 
simple explanation famous november meteors ardan would listen 
preferred believing mother earth feeling three daring children still looking though five thousand miles away shot best rocket signals show still thought would never let watchful eye 
hours continued gaze indescribable interest faintly luminous mass easily distinguishable among heavenly bodies 
jupiter blazed right mars flashed ruddy light left saturn rings looked like round white spot black wall even venus could see almost directly easily recognizing soft sweetly scintillant light 
planet constellation possessed attraction travellers long eyes could trace shadowy crescent edged diamond girdled meteor furrowed spheroid theater existence home many undying desires mysterious cradle race meantime projectile cleaved way upwards rapidly unswervingly though gradually retarding velocity 
earth sensibly grew darker travellers eyes grew dimmer irresistible somnolency slowly stole weary frames 
extraordinary excitement gone last four five hours naturally followed profound reaction 
captain nodding said ardan last longer silence usual fact barbican wake man party puzzling problem 
dum vivimus vivamus asleep let us asleep saying threw mattress companions immediately followed example 
lying hardly quarter hour barbican started cry loud sudden instantly awaken companions 
bright moonlight showed president sitting bed eye blazing arms waving shouted tone reminding day found st helena wood 
eureka got know got cried ardan bouncing seizing right hand 
know cried captain stretching seizing left 
reason hear report well hear asked rapidly breath 
shot times faster sound travel chapter iii 
make home feel quite comfortable 
curious explanation given soundness immediately recognized three friends soon fast wrapped arms morpheus 
fact could found spot favorable undisturbed repose land dwellings whether populous city lonely country continually experience every shock thrills earth crust sea waves winds paddles screws machinery everything tremor quiver jar air balloon incessantly twirling oscillating account ever varying strata different densities even occasionally threatening spill projectile alone floating grandly absolute void midst profoundest silence could offer inmates possibility enjoying slumber complete repose profound 
telling long three daring travellers would continued enjoy sleep suddenly terminated unexpected noise seven clock morning december nd eight hours departure 
noise decidedly barking 
dogs dogs cried ardan springing bound 
must hungry observed captain 
forgotten poor creatures cried barbican 
gone asked ardan looking directions 
last found one hiding sofa 
thunderstruck perfectly bewildered terrible shock poor animal kept close hiding place never daring utter sound last pangs hunger proved strong even fright 
readily recognized amiable diana could allure shivering whining animal retreat without good deal coaxing 
ardan talked honeyed seductive accents trying pull neck 
come friends charming diana went come beauty destined lofty niche temple canine glory come worthy scion race deemed worthy egyptians companion great god anubis christians friend good saint roch come partake glory stars montargis st bernard shall henceforward pale ineffectual fire come lady let think er countless multiplication thy species sailing interplanetary spaces may indulge endless flights fancy number variety thy descendants ere long render selenitic atmosphere vocal canine ululation illustration hungry either 
diana whether flattered allowed dragged still uttering short plaintive whines 
hasty examination satisfying friends frightened hurt hungry either continued search companion 
satellite satellite step way sir cried ardan 
satellite appeared worse slightest sound indicated presence 
last discovered ledge upper portion projectile whither shot terrible concussion 
less fortunate female companion poor fellow received frightful shock life evidently great danger 
acclimatization project looks shaky cried ardan handing animal carefully tenderly others 
poor satellite head crushed roof though recovery seemed hopeless laid body soft cushion soon satisfaction hearing give vent slight sigh 
good said ardan life hope 
must die yet old boy 
shall nurse 
know duty shall shirk responsibility 
rather lose right arm body cause death poor satellite try little water suffering creature swallowed cool draught evident avidity sunk deep slumber 
friends sitting around nothing looked window began watch earth moon great attention 
glittering crescent earth evidently narrower preceding evening volume still enormous compared lunar crescent rapidly assuming proportions perfect circle 
jove suddenly exclaimed ardan start moment full earth globe sun opposition growled nicholl 
case looking great continents great seas new light former glittering solar rays latter darker somewhat shaded see certain maps 
like get glimpse poles earth eye man never yet lighted true replied barbican earth full moon would new say invisible us account solar irradiation 
two much preferable able keep point arrival view rather point departure 
right barbican observed captain besides moon long lunar night give us plenty time gaze full yonder great celestial body former home still swarming fellow beings 
fellow beings longer dear boy cried ardan 
inhabit new world peopled alone projectile ardan barbican fellow barbican nicholl beyond us outside us humanity ends inhabitants microcosm shall continue till moment become selenites pure simple 
shall eighty eight hours replied captain 
much say asked ardan 
half past eight replied nicholl 
regular hour breakfast exclaimed ardan see shadow reason changing 
proposition acceptable especially captain frequently boasted whether land water mountain summits depths mines never missed meal life 
escaping earth travellers felt means escaped laws humanity stomachs called lustily fill aching void 
ardan frenchman claimed post chief cook important office companions yielded alacrity 
gas furnished requisite heat provision chest supplied materials first repast 
commenced three plates excellent soup extracted liebig precious tablets prepared best beef ever roamed pampas 
succeeded several tenderloin beefsteaks though reduced small bulk hydraulic engines american dessicating company pronounced fully tender juicy savory left gridiron london club house 
ardan even swore bleeding others busy contradict 
preserved vegetables various kinds fresher nature according ardan gave agreeable variety entertainment followed several cups magnificent tea unanimously allowed best ever tasted 
odoriferous young hyson gathered year presented emperor russia famous rebel chief yakub kushbegi alexander expressed happy able send boxes friend distinguished president baltimore gun club 
crown meal ardan unearthed exquisite bottle chambertin glasses sparkling richest juice cote travellers drank speedy union earth satellite 
work among generous vineyards burgundy enough show interest matter even sun wished join party 
precisely moment projectile beginning leave conical shadow cast earth rays glorious king day struck lower surface obliquely perpendicularly account slight obliquity moon orbit earth 
illustration union earth satellite 
sun cried ardan 
course said barbican looking watch exactly time 
see bottom light projectile asked ardan 
moment reflection must tell replied barbican started last night sun almost directly us therefore continue move straight line must still rear 
clear enough said captain another consideration free say rather perplexes 
since earth lies us sun see sunlight forming great ring around globe words instead full sun plainly see witness annular eclipse cool clear head yet quite recovered shock dear captain replied barbican smile 
two reasons see ring eclipse account angle moon orbit makes earth three bodies present direct line therefore see sun little west earth secondly even exactly straight line still far point whence annular eclipse would visible 
true said ardan cone earth shadow must extend far beyond moon 
nearly four times far said barbican still moon orbit earth lie exactly plane lunar eclipse occur nodes coincide period full moon generally twice never three times year 
started four days occurrence lunar eclipse travel time dark 
would obnoxious many reasons 
one instance evident one though present moment moving vacuum projectile steeped solar rays revels light heat 
hence great saving gas important point household economy 
effect solar rays tempered genial medium like atmosphere soon began glare glow intensity projectile influence felt like suddenly passing winter summer 
moon overhead sun beneath actually inundated fiery rays 
one feels good cried captain rubbing hands 
little good cried ardan 
already like hot house 
little garden clay could raise splendid crop peas twenty four hours 
hope heaven walls projectile melt like wax alarmed dear friend observed barbican quietly 
projectile seen worst far heat concerned tearing atmosphere endured temperature liable present stands comparison 
fact astonished eyes friends stony hill resembled moment two red hot meteor 
poor marston must looked us roasted alive observed ardan 
could saved us sure tell replied barbican 
must acknowledge danger made provision whatever 
knew said captain strength laid fifth wager 
probably laughed ardan time enough get grilled heard men dipped fingers molten iron impunity 
whilst ardan captain arguing point barbican began busying making everything comfortable instead four days journey one four years contemplated 
reader doubt remembers floor projectile contained square feet chamber nine feet high space economized much possible nothing absolute necessities admitted kept strictly place therefore travellers room enough move around certain liberty 
thick glass window floor quite solid part sun streaming lit projectile strangely producing singular startling effects light appearing come wrong way 
first thing done see water cask provision chest 
injured slightest respect thanks means taken counteract shock 
provisions good condition abundant enough supply travellers whole year barbican taken care safe side case projectile might land deserted region moon 
water liquors travellers enough two months 
relying latest observations astronomers convinced moon atmosphere heavy dense thick deep valleys springs streams water could hardly fail show 
journey therefore first year installation lunar continent daring travellers would pretty safe danger hunger thirst 
air supply proved also quite satisfactory 
reiset regnault apparatus producing oxygen contained supply chlorate potash sufficient two months 
productive material maintained temperature hundred degrees fahr steady consumption gas required supply far exceeded demand 
whole arrangement worked charmingly requiring odd glance 
high temperature changing chlorate chloride oxygen disengaged gradually abundantly every eighteen pounds chlorate potash furnishing seven pounds oxygen necessary daily consumption inmates projectile 
still reader need hardly reminded sufficient renew exhausted oxygen complete purification air required absorption carbonic acid exhaled lungs 
nearly hours atmosphere gradually becoming charged deleterious gas produced combustion blood inspired oxygen 
captain soon saw noticing difficulty diana panting 
even appeared smothering carbonic acid famous grotto del cane banks lake agnano near naples collecting like water floor projectile account great specific gravity 
already threatened poor dog life though yet endangering masters 
captain seeing state things hastily laid floor one two cups containing caustic potash water stirred mixture gently substance powerful affinity carbonic acid greedily absorbed moments air completely purified 
others begun time check state instruments 
thermometer barometer right except one self recorder glass got broken 
excellent aneroid barometer taken safe sound wadded box carefully hung hook wall 
marked pressure air projectile also quantity watery vapor contained 
needle oscillating little beyond thirty pointed pretty steadily fair 
mariner compasses also found quite free injury 
course hardly necessary say needles pointed particular direction magnetic pole earth unable distance exercise appreciable influence 
brought moon expected compasses subjected influence current would attest certain phenomena 
case would interesting verify earth satellite similarly affected magnetic forces 
hypsometer instrument ascertaining heights lunar mountains barometric pressure water boils sextant measure altitude sun theodolite taking horizontal vertical angles telescopes indispensable necessity travellers approach moon instruments carefully examined found still perfect working order notwithstanding violence terrible shock start 
picks spades tools carefully selected captain also bags various kinds grain bundles various kinds shrubs ardan expected transplant lunar plains still safe places around upper corners projectile 
articles also evidently possessed great interest frenchman 
nobody else seemed know seemed hurry tell 
every would climb means iron pins fixed wall inspect treasures whatever arranged rearranged evident pleasure rapidly passed careful hand certain mysterious boxes joyfully sang falsest possible false voices lively piece nicolo le temps est beau la route est belle la promenade est un plaisir 
day bright hearts light 
sweet rove wood dell 
well known air mignon leg res hirondelles oiseaux b nis de dieu ouvrez ouvrez vos ailes envolez vous adieu farewell happy swallows farewell summer ever dwell ye leave northern strand genial southern land balmy breezes bland 
return ah tell farewell happy swallows farewell barbican much gratified find rockets fireworks received least injury 
relied upon performance important service soon projectile passed point neutral attraction earth moon would begin fall accelerated velocity towards lunar surface 
descent though thanks respective volumes attracting bodies six times less rapid would surface earth would still violent enough dash projectile thousand pieces 
barbican confidently expected means powerful rockets offer considerable obstruction violence fall counteract terrible effects altogether 
inspection thus given general satisfaction travellers set watching external space lights sides floor projectile 
everything still appeared state 
nothing changed 
vast arch celestial dome glittered stars constellations blazed light clear pure enough throw astronomer ecstasy admiration 
shone sun like mouth white hot furnace dazzling disc defined sharply pitch black back ground sky 
moon reflecting back rays glowing surface appeared stand motionless midst starry host 
little east sun could see pretty large dark spot like hole sky broad silver fringe one edge fading faint glimmering mist earth 
directions nebulous masses gleamed like large flakes star dust nadir zenith eye could trace without break vast ring impalpable star powder famous milky way midst beams glorious sun struggle dusky pallor star fourth magnitude 
observers never weary gazing magnificent novel spectacle grandeur hardly necessary say description give adequate idea 
profound reflections suggested understandings vivid emotions enkindled imaginations barbican desirous commenting story journey still influenced inspiring impressions noted carefully hour hour every fact signalized beginning enterprise 
wrote notes carefully systematically round full hand business like ever never betraying slightest emotion 
captain quite busy different way 
pulling tablets reviewed calculations regarding motion projectiles velocities ranges paths retardations accelerations jotting figures rapidity wonderful behold 
ardan neither wrote calculated kept incessant fire small talk barbican hardly ever answered nicholl never heard occasionally diana never understood oftenest said liked talk sensible man also hear sensible man say 
never stood still moment kept bobbing around effervescent briskness bee one time roosting top ladder another peering floor light right left always humming scraps opera bouffe never changing air 
small space whole world travellers represented life animation loquacity french need hardly say played part perfection 
eventful day speak correctly space twelve hours us forms day ended travellers abundant supper exquisitely cooked 
highly enjoyed 
incident yet occurred nature calculated shake confidence 
apprehending none therefore full hope rather already certain success soon lost peaceful slumber whilst projectile moving rapidly though velocity uniformly retarding still cleaved way pathless regions empyrean 
chapter iv 
chapter cornell girls 
incident worth recording occurred night night indeed could called 
reality night even day projectile rather strictly speaking always night upper end bullet always day lower 
whenever therefore words night day occur story reader readily understand referring spaces time called earthly almanacs measured travellers chronometers 
repose friends must indeed undisturbed absolute freedom sound jar kind could secure tranquillity 
spite immense velocity projectile still seemed perfectly motionless 
slightest sign movement could detected 
change locality though ever rapid never reveal senses takes place vacuum enveloping atmosphere travels rate moving body 
though incessantly whirled around sun rate seventy thousand miles hour us conscious slightest motion case far sensation concerned motion repose absolutely identical 
neither effect one way another material body 
body motion remains motion obstacle stops 
rest remains rest superior force compels change position 
indifference bodies motion rest physicists call inertia 
barbican companions therefore shut projectile could readily imagine completely motionless 
outside effect would precisely 
rush air jarring sensation would betray slightest movement 
sight moon gradually growing larger earth gradually growing smaller beneath could safely swear fast anchored ocean deathlike immobility 
towards morning next day december awakened joyful quite unexpected sound 
cock doodle doo accompanied decided flapping wings 
frenchman feet one instant top ladder another attempted shut lid half open box speaking angry suppressed voice stop hullabaloo want fail great combination hello cried barbican nicholl starting rubbing eyes 
noise asked barbican 
seems heard crowing cock observed captain 
never thought ears could easily deceived captain cried ardan quickly let us try flapping ribs arms gave vent crow loud natural lustiest chanticleer ever saluted orb day might proud 
captain roared right even barbican snickered saw companion evidently wanted conceal something immediately assumed straight faces pretended think matter 
barbican said ardan coming ladder evidently anxious change conversation idea thinking night slightest 
thinking promptness reply received last year authorities cambridge university asked feasibility sending bullet moon 
know well time perfect ignoramus mathematics 
often puzzled thinking grounds could form positive opinion case certain calculation must exceedingly delicate matter 
feasibility mean say replied barbican exactly sending bullet moon sending neutral point earth moon lies nine tenths journey two attractions counteract 
point passed projectile would reach moon surface virtue weight 
well reaching neutral point replied ardan like know able come necessary initial velocity yards second nothing simpler answered barbican 
could done asked frenchman 
without slightest difficulty 
captain could readily solved problem reply university saved us trouble 
well barbican dear boy observed ardan got say might chop head body beginning feet could make go calculation 
simply understand algebra replied barbican quietly 
oh well cried ardan ironical smile 
great x men think settle everything uttering word algebra ardan asked barbican think people could beat iron without hammer turn furrows without plough hardly 
well algebra instrument utensil much hammer plough good instrument know make use 
earnest quite 
handle instrument right eyes certainly interests much 
show got initial velocity projectile greatest pleasure 
taking proper consideration elements problem viz distance centres earth moon earth radius volume moon volume easily calculate must initial velocity simple formula 
let us formula 
one moment give curve really described projectile moves earth moon obtained allowing combined movement around sun 
consider earth sun motionless sufficient present purpose 
give exact curve would solve point problem three bodies integral calculus yet reached 
cried ardan mocking tone really anything mathematics yes said barbican still great deal mathematics even attempt 
far good resumed ardan 
integral calculus branch mathematics object summation certain infinite series indefinitely small terms solution must generally know function given function differential coefficient 
words continued barbican return differential coefficient function deduced 
clear mud cried ardan hearty laugh 
let bit paper pencil added barbican half hour shall formula meantime easily find something interesting 
seconds barbican profoundly absorbed problem nicholl watching window ardan busily employed preparing breakfast 
morning meal quite ready barbican raising head showed ardan page covered algebraic signs end stood following formula r r r v v gr x x r means asked ardan 
means said captain taking part discussion half v prime squared minus v squared equals gr multiplied r x minus one plus prime multiplied r minus x minus r minus r interrupted ardan roar laughter x stradlegs making z jumping p mean say understand terrible jargon captain nothing clearer ardan 
captain course must give gracefully declare sun noon day palpably evident sense barbican formula 
asked algebra know observed barbican 
rock crystal nothing fact barbican said captain looking paper worked thing well 
integral equation living forces doubt give us result sought 
yes like understand know cried ardan would give ten years captain life understand listen said barbican 
half v prime squared less v squared formula giving us half variation living force 
mac pretends understands need solomon said captain 
signs appear consider cabalistic form language clearest shortest logical read 
pretend captain means hieroglyphics far incomprehensible sacred ibis egyptians discover velocity projectile start undoubtedly replied captain formula even tell rate velocity particular point journey 

deep one president 
ardan 
really difficult part question barbican done 
make equation takes account conditions problem 
simple affair arithmetic requiring knowledge four rules work

captain clerking mississippi steamboat professor mathematics indiana university felt quite home work 
rained figures pencil velocity would made marston stare 
page page filled multiplications divisions barbican looked quietly ardan impatiently stroked head ears keep rising head ache 
well last asked barbican seeing captain stop throw somewhat hasty glance work 
well answered nicholl slowly confidently calculation made think correctly v velocity projectile quitting atmosphere sufficient carry neutral point least much asked barbican eagerly 
least yards first second 
cried barbican jumping seat 
much say yards first second quits atmosphere 
oh malediction cried barbican gesture terrible despair 
matter asked ardan much surprised 
enough matter answered barbican excitedly 
velocity diminished third initial velocity least yards first second cried nicholl rapidly flourishing pencil 
cambridge observatory declared yards first second sufficient projectile started greater velocity well asked nicholl 
well velocity never cried captain ardan one voice 
never reach neutral point thunder lightning fire fury get even halfway heaven earth mille noms un boulet cried ardan wildly gesticulating 
shall fall back earth oh ah could say 
fearful revelation took like stroke apoplexy 
chapter v colds space 
could imagine observatory men committed blunder barbican would believe possible 
made captain go calculation flaw found 
carefully examined figure figure could find nothing wrong 
took formula subjected strongest tests invulnerable 
denying fact 
cambridge professors undoubtedly blundered saying initial velocity yards second would enough carry neutral point 
velocity nearly yards would lowest required purpose 
simply forgotten allow third friction 
three friends kept profound silence time 
breakfast last thing thought 
barbican teeth grating fingers clutching eye brows closely contracting gazed grimly window 
captain last resource examined calculations earnestly hoping find figure wrong 
ardan could neither sit stand lie still second though tried three 
silence course last long 
ha ha ha laughed bitterly 
precious scientific men villainous old hombogues whole set worth straw hope gracious since must fall shall drop plumb cambridge observatory leave single one miserable old women called professors alive premises certain expression ardan angry exclamation struck captain like shot set temples throbbing violently 
must fall exclaimed starting suddenly 
let us see seven clock morning 
must therefore least thirty two hours road half passage already made 
going fall must falling certain barbican find barbican caught idea like lightning seizing compass began floor window measure visual angle distant earth 
apparent immobility projectile allowed great exactness 
laying aside instrument wiping thick drops sweat bedewed forehead began jotting figures piece paper 
captain looked keen interest knew well barbican calculating distance earth apparent measure terrestrial diameter eyed anxiously 
pretty soon friends saw color stealing barbican pale face triumphant light glittering eye 
brave boys exclaimed last throwing pencil falling far present thousand miles earth hurrah bravo cried nicholl ardan breath 
passed point stopped initial velocity cambridge men allowed us hurrah hurrah bravo bravissimo still going glory glory hallelujah sang nicholl highest excitement 
vive ce cher barbican cried ardan bursting french usual whenever feelings better 
course marching continued nicholl know reason 
pounds gun cotton gave us greater initial velocity expected right captain added barbican besides must forget getting rid water projectile relieved considerable weight correct cried captain 
thought therefore brave boys continued barbican excitement away melancholy right yes everything lovely goose hangs high cried captain grand occasions little slang 
talking goose reminds breakfast cried ardan assure fright taken away appetite yes continued barbican 
captain quite right 
initial velocity fortunately much greater cambridge friends calculated us hang cambridge friends calculations cried ardan asperity usual scientific men brass brains bed fellows oysters gulf mexico thanks kind cambridge friends 
talking oysters let remind breakfast ready 
meal joyous one 
ate much talked laughed 
little incident algebra certainly much enlivened situation 
boys ardan went things thus turning quite comfortable would ask succeed fairly started 
breakers ahead see 
rock road 
freer ships raging ocean aye freer balloons blustering air 
ship arrives destination balloon borne wings wind rises high altitude endured projectile reach moon reach moon nodded barbican 
shall reach moon know cried nicholl enthusiastically 
great american nation must disappointed continued ardan 
people earth capable originating enterprise people capable producing barbican hurrah cried nicholl 
point settled continued frenchman another question comes yet called attention 
get moon shall going amuse afraid life awfully slow companions emphatically disclaimed possibility thing 
may deny know better knowing better laid stores accordingly 
choose 
possess varied assortment 
chess draughts cards dominoes everything fact billiard table exclaimed barbican cumbered gimcracks gimcracks good amuse eminently calculated also win us friendship selenites 
friend michael said barbican moon inhabited inhabitants must appeared several thousand years advent man earth seems little doubt luna considerably older terra present state 
therefore selenites brain organized like must time invented possessed even much still invent course ages 
probability instead learning us shall much learn 
asked ardan think artists like phidias michael angelo raphael certainly 
poets like homer virgil dante shakspeare g hugo doubt 
philosophers like plato aristotle descartes bacon kant scientists like euclid archimedes copernicus newton pascal think 
famous actors singers composers photographers could almost swear 
dear boy since gone ahead far even farther great selenites tried start communication earth fired projectile regions lunar regions terrestrial says done asked barbican coolly 
attempting communication observed captain would certainly much easier us principally two reasons 
first attraction moon surface six times less earth projectile could sent rapidly second projectile need sent instead thousand miles could quantity powder ten times less require purpose 
ask said frenchman made attempt reply answered barbican 
know made attempt made thousands years ago invention writing even appearance man earth 
bullet asked ardan triumphantly bullet produce bullet friend michael answered barbican quiet smile appear forget surface earth water 
therefore bullet likely lying moment bottom atlantic pacific anywhere else surface globe 
besides may sunk weak point surface early epoch crust earth acquired sufficient solidity 
captain said ardan turning smile nicholl use trying catch barby slippery eel answer everything 
still theory subject think harm ventilate 
selenites never sent us projectile simply gunpowder older wiser never fools invent 
diana howling breakfast good like genuine scientific men squabbling nonsense let poor animals die hunger 
excuse us diana first time little suffer senseless disputes great 
saying laid animal toothsome pie contemplated evident pleasure successful efforts towards hasty complete disappearance 
looking diana went makes almost wish made noah ark projectile introducing pair domestic animals room enough observed barbican 
doubt remarked captain ox cow horse goat ruminating animals would useful lunar continent 
turn projectile stable know 
still might made room pair poor little donkeys observed ardan love poor beasts 
fellow feeling say 
doubt really animal pity 
ill treated brutes creation 
banged life banged worse death hey make asked companions surprised 
make skins drum heads replied ardan air answering conundrum 
barbican nicholl could hardly help laughing absurd reply lively companion hilarity soon stopped expression face assumed bent satellite body lay stretched sofa 
matter asked barbican 
satellite attack replied ardan 
good said nicholl misunderstanding 
yes suppose good poor fellow observed ardan melancholy accents 
life one skull broken hardly enviable possession 
grand acclimatization project knocked sky high senses one doubt poor dog death 
expression ardan countenance looked friends rueful order 
well said practical barbican help next thing done get rid body 
keep us forty eight hours longer 
course replied captain need lights provided hinges lifted back 
prevent us opening one flinging body president gun club reflected minutes spoke yes done must take careful precautions 
asked ardan 
two simple reasons replied barbican first refers air enclosed projectile must careful lose least possible quantity 
manufacture air objected ardan 
manufacture air partly friend michael replied barbican 
manufacture oxygen supply nitrogen bye ardan watch apparatus carefully every see oxygen generated freely 
serious consequences would attend immoderate supply oxygen manufacture nitrogen absolutely necessary air might escape readily open windows 
seconds require flinging poor satellite seconds indeed said barbican gravely 
second reason asked ardan 
second reason must allow external cold must exceedingly great penetrate projectile freeze us alive 
sun know yes sun heats projectile heat vacuum floating 
air neither heat light wherever rays sun arrive directly must cold dark 
temperature around us anything called temperature produced solely stellar radiation 
need say low scale would temperature earth fall sun suddenly extinguished 
little fear million years said nicholl 
tell asked ardan 
besides even admitting sun soon extinguished prevent earth shooting away let friend michael speak said barbican smile captain may learn something 
certainly may continued frenchman room anything new 
struck comet tail said anyhow observed captain 
well remember nonsense papers phosphorescent auroral glare 
well continued frenchman suppose comet influenced earth attraction superior sun would consequence would earth follow attracting body become satellite thus last dragged distance sun rays could longer excite heat surface well might possibly occur said barbican slowly even question consequences would terrible seem apprehend 
cold heat might still manage nearly equalized globe 
calculated earth carried comet arrived greatest distance would experienced temperature hardly sixteen times greater heat receive moon everybody knows produces appreciable effect even concentrated focus powerful lenses 
well exclaimed ardan temperature wait moment replied barbican 
never heard principle compensation listen another calculation 
earth dragged along comet calculated perihelion nearest point sun would endure heat times greater mean summer temperature 
heat fully capable turning rocks glass oceans vapor proceeding extremity must first formed thick interposing ring clouds thus considerably modified excessive temperature 
therefore extreme cold aphelion excessive heat perihelion great law compensation probable mean temperature would tolerably endurable 
many degrees temperature interplanetary space estimated asked nicholl 
time ago replied barbican temperature considered low indeed millions millions degrees zero 
fourrier auxerre distinguished member acad mie des sciences whose moires temperature planetary spaces appeared reduced figures considerably diminished proportions 
according careful estimation temperature space much lower degrees fahr 
zero 
asked ardan 
answered barbican though must acknowledge word moire recorded elements important determination lost somewhere longer found 
attach slightest importance man words unless sustained reliable evidence exclaimed nicholl 
besides much mistaken pouillet another countryman ardan academician well fourrier esteems temperature interplanetary spaces least fahr 
zero 
easily verify moment actual experiment 
exactly observed barbican solar rays striking projectile directly would give us elevated instead low temperature 
arrived moon nights fifteen days long faces experiences alternately shall plenty time make experiment every condition favor 
sure satellite present moving vacuum 
vacuum asked ardan perfect vacuum well perfect vacuum far air concerned 
air replaced nothing oh yes replied barbican 
ether 
ah ether pray ether ether friend michael elastic gas consisting imponderable atoms told works molecular physics proportion size far apart celestial bodies space 
distance less x one trillionth foot 
vibrations molecules ether produce sensations light heat making trillions undulations per second undulation hardly one ten millionth inch width 
trillions per second ten millionths inch width cried ardan 
oscillations neatly counted ticketed checked ah friend barbican continued frenchman shaking head numbers tremendous guesses frightening ear revealing nothing intelligence 
get ideas however must calculate interrupted ardan calculate compare 
trillion tells nothing comparison everything 
instance say volume uranus times greater earth saturn times greater jupiter times greater sun thousand times greater may tell till tired hearing shall still almost ignorant ever 
part prefer told one simple comparisons find old almanacs sun globe two feet diameter jupiter good sized orange saturn smaller orange neptune plum uranus good sized cherry earth pea venus also pea somewhat smaller mars large pin head mercury mustard seed juno ceres vesta pallas asteroids many grains sand 
told something like got least tail idea learned burst ardan natural effect making hearers forget arguing therefore proceeded dispose satellite body 
simple matter enough fling projectile space sailors get rid dead body throwing sea 
operation act barbican recommended utmost care dispatch lose little possible internal air great elasticity would violently strive escape 
bolts floor light foot diameter carefully unscrewed ardan good deal affected prepared launch dog body space 
glass worked powerful lever enabled overcome pressure enclosed air turned quickly hinges poor satellite dropped 
whole operation well managed little air escaped ever afterwards barbican employed means rid projectile litter useless matter occasionally encumbered 
evening third december wore away without incident 
soon barbican announced projectile still winging way though retarded velocity towards lunar disc travellers quietly retired rest 
illustration poor satellite dropped 
chapter vi 
instructive conversation 
fourth december projectile chronometers marked five clock morning travellers woke pleasant slumber 
hours journey 
lapse time passed much half number hours trip last lapse space already accomplished nearly seven tenths passage 
difference time distance due regular retardation velocity 
looked earth floor light little visible black spot drowned solar rays 
longer sign crescent longer sign ashy light 
next day towards midnight earth new precise moment moon full 
overhead could see queen night coming nearer nearer line followed projectile evidently approaching point meet appointed moment 
around black vault heaven dotted luminous points seemed move somewhat though course extreme distance relative size underwent change 
sun stars looked exactly appeared observed earth 
moon indeed become considerably enlarged size travellers telescopes still weak enable make important observation regarding nature surface might determine topographical geological features 
naturally therefore time slipped away endless conversation 
moon course chief topic 
one contributed share peculiar information peculiar ignorance case might 
barbican nicholl always treated subject gravely became learned scientists ardan preferred look things eye fancy 
projectile situation direction incidents possible occur precautions necessary take order break fall moon surface many subjects furnished endless food constant debate inexhaustible conjectures 
instance breakfast morning question ardan regarding projectile drew barbican answer curious enough reported 
suppose night shot stony hill said ardan suppose projectile encountered obstacle powerful enough stop would consequence sudden halt replied barbican understand obstacle could met powerful enough stop 
suppose obstacle sake argument said ardan 
suppose supposed replied matter fact barbican possibly supposed unless indeed original impulse proved weak 
case velocity would decreased degrees projectile would suddenly stopped 
suppose struck body space 
body instance well enormous bolide met 
oh hastily observed captain projectile would dashed thousand pieces along 
better observed barbican burned alive 
burned alive laughed ardan 
pity missed interesting experiment liked find felt would much time record observations friend michael assure observed barbican 
case plain enough 
heat motion convertible terms 
mean heating water simply giving increased fact violent motion molecules 
well exclaimed frenchman ingenious theory ingenious correct dear friend completely explains phenomena caloric 
heat nothing molecular movement violent oscillation particles body 
apply brakes train train stops 
become motion turns heat makes brakes hot 
people grease axles hinder getting hot assuredly would become friction allowed obstruct motion 
understand though replied ardan apparently earnest 
let show thoroughly 
running hard long feel perspiring like bull hot furnace 
forced stop simply motion transformed heat course understand barbican smiled moment comical illustration theory went accordingly case collision would instantly projectile 
seen becomes bullet strikes iron target 
flattened shape sometimes even melted thin film 
motion turned heat 
therefore maintain projectile struck bolide velocity suddenly checked would given rise heat capable completely volatilizing less second 
doubt said captain 
president added moment calculated would result earth suddenly brought stand still journey orbit calculated answered barbican case much heat would developed would instantly reduce vapor 
hm exclaimed ardan remarkably simple way putting end world supposing earth fall sun asked captain 
fall answered barbican according calculations tyndall thomson would develop amount heat equal produced sixteen hundred globes burning coal globe equal size earth 
furthermore fall would supply sun least much heat expends hundred years hundred years good nothing like accuracy cried ardan 
infallible calculators messrs tyndall thomson easily excuse airs may give 
must order much higher ordinary mortals like us would answer accuracy intricate problems quietly observed barbican doubt whatever regarding one fact motion suddenly interrupted always develops heat 
given rise another theory regarding maintenance sun temperature constant point 
incessant rain bolides falling surface compensates sufficiently heat continually giving forth 
calculated good lord deliver us cried ardan putting hands ears comes tyndall thomson calculated continued barbican heeding interruption shock every bolide drawn sun surface gravity must produce amount heat equal combustion four thousand blocks coal size falling bolide 
wager another cent bold savants calculated heat sun cried ardan incredulous laugh 
precisely done answered barbican referring memorandum book heat emitted sun continued exactly would produced combustion layer coal enveloping sun surface like atmosphere miles thickness 
well done heat would capable melting hour stratum ice feet thick according another calculation raising globe ice cold water times size earth boiling point hour 
calculate exact fraction second would take cook couple eggs laughed ardan 
soon believe one calculation 
extreme heat cook us like many beefsteaks two good sufficient reasons answered barbican 
first place terrestrial atmosphere absorbs solar heat 
second quantity solar heat intercepted earth two billionth part radiated 
fortunate handy thing atmosphere around us cried frenchman enables us breathe actually keeps us sizzling like griskins 
yes said captain unfortunately say much moon 
oh pshaw cried ardan always full confidence 
right moon either inhabited 
inhabitants must breathe 
must oxygen enough left us co even go bottom ravines gravity must accumulated much better shall climb thundering mountains saying jumped began gaze considerable interest lunar disc glittering dazzling brightness 
jove exclaimed length must pretty hot think observed captain especially remember day lasts hours yes observed barbican remember hand nights long heat escapes radiation mean temperature much greater interplanetary space 
high old place living cried ardan 
matter wish jolly dear boys old mother earth moon see always sky never rising never setting never undergoing change except new earth last quarter would fun trace shape great oceans continents say mediterranean china gulf mexico white line rocky mountains old marston watching us big telescope see every line brightness shadow fade away degrees came nearer nearer sun last sat completely lost dazzling rays way barbican eclipses moon yes solar eclipses replied barbican must always occur whenever centres three heavenly bodies line earth occupying middle place 
however eclipses must always annular earth projected like screen solar disc allows half sun still visible 
asked nicholl total eclipses moon surely cone earth shadow must extend far enough envelop surface reach one sense replied barbican another 
remember great refraction solar rays must produced earth atmosphere 
easy show refraction prevents sun ever totally invisible 
see continued pulling tablets let represent horizontal parallax b half sun apparent diameter ouch cried frenchman making wry face comes mr x square riding mischief pair double zeros talk english yankee dutch greek man even little arabic digest hang endure algebra well talking yankee replied barbican smile mean distance moon earth sixty terrestrial radii length conic shadow consequence atmospheric refraction reduced less forty two radii 
consequently moment eclipse moon far beyond reach real shadow see border rays sun even proceeding center 
oh cried ardan loud laugh eclipse sun moment sun quite visible like bull mr philosopher barbican yet perfectly true notwithstanding answered barbican 
moment sun eclipsed see eclipsed see means rays even lost nearly brightness passage terrestrial atmosphere barbican right friend michael observed captain slowly phenomenon occurs earth every morning sunrise refraction shows us sun new ris n looking horizontal misty air shorn beams 
must right said ardan justice though quick seeing reason quicker acknowledge justice yes must right begin understand last clearly really meant 
however judge get 
apropos nothing tell barbican think moon ancient comet come far within sphere earth attraction kept turned satellite well original idea said barbican smile 
ideas generally category observed ardan affectation dry pomposity 
time however friend michael observed nicholl 
oh plagiarist asked frenchman pretending irritated 
well something like observed nicholl quietly 
apollonius rhodius read one evening philadelphia library speaks arcadians greece tradition ancestors ancient inhabited earth long moon ever become satellite 
therefore called greek prosel noi ante lunarians 
starting wild notion certain scientists looked moon ancient comet brought close enough earth retained orbit terrestrial attraction 
may something plausible hypothesis asked ardan curiosity 
nothing whatever replied barbican decidedly simple proof fact moon retain slightest trace vaporous envelope comets always surrounded 
lost tail mean said ardan 
pooh easy account might got cut coming close sun might friend michael amputation means likely 
jove say know cried barbican quiet smile countenance 
oh lot volumes cried ardan could made know present instance observed nicholl know clock 
three clock said barbican glancing chronometer 
cried ardan surprise 
bless us rapidly time passes engaged scientific conversation ouf getting decidedly learned feel swallowed library feel observed nicholl listening lecture astronomy star course

spring balance instance tension coil independent attraction would readily given exact equivalent loss 
attraction weight according newton well known law acting direct proportion mass attracting body inverse proportion square distance consequence clearly follows earth alone space heavenly bodies suddenly annihilated earth projectile would less weight would 
however would never entirely lose weight terrestrial attraction would always made felt matter distance 
earth celestial body possessing attraction evident may point space respective attractions may entirely annihilated mutual counteraction 
phenomenon present instance case point 
short time projectile contents would moments absolutely completely deprived weight whatsoever

point body possessed energy principle movement within would remain forever relatively motionless suspended like mahomet coffin equally attracted two orbs nothing impelling one direction rather 
projectile moment nearing point reached would consequence question three answers presented possible circumstances different results 

suppose projectile possess velocity enough pass neutral point 
case would undoubtedly proceed onward moon drawn thither lunar attraction 

suppose lacked requisite velocity reaching neutral point 
case would certainly fall back earth obedience law terrestrial attraction 

suppose animated sufficient velocity reach neutral point pass 
case projectile would remain forever spot perfectly motionless far regards earth moon though course following annual orbits round sun 
state things barbican tried explain friends need hardly said listened remarks intense interest

let us satisfied moon least shall account chapter ix 
little track 
barbican mind completely rest least one subject 
original force discharge great enough send projectile beyond neutral line 
therefore longer danger falling back earth 
therefore longer danger resting eternally motionless point counteracting attractions 
next subject engage attention question would projectile influence lunar attraction succeed reaching destination way could succeed falling space nearly miles striking moon surface 
terrific fall even taking lunar attraction one sixth earth fall simply bewildering think 
greatest height balloon ever ascended seven miles glaisher 
imagine fall even distance imagine fall height four thousand miles yet fall appalling kind surface moon travellers prepare 
instead avoiding however eagerly desired would much disappointed missed 
taken best precautions could devise guard terrific shock 
mainly two kinds one intended counteract much possible fearful results expected instant projectile touched lunar surface retard velocity fall thereby render less violent 
best arrangement first kind certainly barbican water contrivance counteracting shock starting fully described former volume 
see baltimore gun club page 
unfortunately could longer employed 
even partitions working order water two thousand pounds weight required longer 
little still left tanks account purpose 
besides single drop precious liquid spare yet anything sanguine regarding facility finding water moon surface 
fortunately however gentle reader may remember barbican besides using water break concussion provided movable disc stout pillars containing strong buffing apparatus intended protect striking bottom violently destruction different partitions 
buffers still good gravity yet almost imperceptible put order adjust disc difficult task 
travellers set work soon accomplished 
different pieces put together readily mere matter bolts screws plenty tools manage 
short time repaired disc rested steel buffers like table legs rather like sofa seat springs 
new arrangement attended least one disadvantage 
bottom light covered convenient view moon surface could soon begin fall perpendicular descent 
however slight matter side lights would permit adventurers enjoy quite favorable view vast regions moon afforded balloon travellers looking earth sides car 
disc arrangement completed hour till past twelve clock things restored usual order 
barbican tried make fresh observations regarding inclination projectile decided chagrin found yet turned sufficiently commence perpendicular fall contrary even seemed following curve rather parallel lunar disc 
queen stars glittered light dazzling ever whilst opposite part sky glorious king day flooded fires 
situation began look little serious 
shall ever get asked captain 
let us prepared getting barbican dubious reply 
pretty pair suspenders said ardan cheerily meant course doubting hesitators fluent command english sometimes led solecisms 
certainly shall get perhaps little sooner good us 
reply sharply recalled barbican task undertaken went work seriously trying combine arrangements break fall 
reader may perhaps remember ardan reply captain day famous meeting tampa 
fall would violent enough captain urged splinter like glass thousand fragments 
shall prevent ardan ready reply breaking fall means counteracting rockets suitably disposed let proper time practical utility idea impressed barbican 
could hardly doubted powerful rockets fastened outside bottom projectile could discharged considerably retard velocity fall sturdy recoil 
could burn vacuum means oxygen furnished powder burns chamber gun volcanoes moon continue action regardless absence lunar atmosphere 
barbican therefore provided rockets enclosed strong steel gun barrels grooved outside could screwed corresponding holes already made much care bottom projectile 
long enough flush floor inside project outside six inches 
twenty number formed two concentric circles around dead light 
small holes disc gave admission wires rockets discharged externally electricity 
whole effect therefore confined outside 
mixtures already carefully deposited barrel nothing need done take away metallic plugs screwed bottom projectile replace rockets every one found fit grooved chamber rigid exactness 
evidently done disc finally laid springs 
lifted order reach bottom projectile work done strictly necessary 
though labor hard considering gravity yet scarcely made felt nicholl ardan sorry little joke barbican expense 
frenchman began humming aliquandoque bonus dormitat homerus tune orph e aux enfers captain said something philadelphia highway commissioners pave street one day tear next lay gas pipes 
friends humor lost barbican wrapped work probably never heard word said 
towards three clock every preparation made every possible precaution taken bold adventurers nothing watch wait 
projectile certainly approaching moon 
time turned considerably influence attraction original motion still followed decidedly oblique direction 
consequence two forces might possibly tangent line approaching edge moon disc 
one thing certain projectile yet commenced fall directly towards surface base center gravity lay still turned away considerably perpendicular 
barbican countenance soon showed perplexity even alarm 
projectile proving intractable laws gravitation 
unknown opening dimly great boundless unknown starry plains 
pride confidence scientist flattered sounded consequence every possible hypothesis regarding projectile ultimate fate return earth arrival moon motionless dead stop neutral point 
new incomprehensible fourth hypothesis big terrors mystic infinite rose disturbed mind like grim hollow ghost 
seconds however looked straight face without wincing 
companions showed firm 
whether science emboldened barbican phlegmatic stoicism propped captain enthusiastic vivacity cheered irrepressible ardan exactly say 
certainly soon talking matter calmly would discuss advisability taking sail lake beautiful evening july 
first remarks decidedly peculiar quite characteristic 
men would asked projectile taking 
think question ever occurred bit 
simply began asking could cause new strange state things 
track appears observed ardan 
opinion answered captain projectile aimed true 
every possible precaution taken well aware know inch line even tenth part hair breadth wrong start would sent us thousands miles course time 
say barbican asked ardan 
think error start confident reply even much line took many tests proving absolute perpendicularity columbiad entertain slightest doubt subject 
direction towards zenith incontestable see reach moon comes zenith 
perhaps behind time suggested ardan 
say barbican asked captain 
know cambridge men said journey done hours minutes seconds 
much say time shall miss moon 
correct said barbican 
behind time 
started know december st minutes seconds clock arrive four days later midnight precisely 
day december th gentlemen please examine watches 
half past three afternoon 
eight hours half sufficient take us journey end 
arrive ahead time asked captain 
said ardan 
know discovered initial velocity greater expected 
cried barbican slight excess velocity would done harm whatever direction projectile perfectly true 

must digression 
must switched switched asked listeners one breath 
tell said barbican curtly 
well said ardan barbican tell end talk subject 
switched enough 
done care 
going care 
use pestering brains shall soon find 
floating around space shall end hauling somewhere 
indifference barbican far participating 
prepared meet future bold manly heart 
inability answer question rendered uneasy 
switched would given worlds answer brain sorely puzzled sought one vain 
mean time projectile continued turn side rather base towards moon assume lateral rather direct movement movement fully participated multitude objects thrown outside 
barbican could even convince sighting several points lunar surface time hardly fifteen eighteen thousand miles distant velocity projectile instead accelerating becoming uniform 
another proof perpendicular fall 
however though original impulsive force still superior moon attraction travellers evidently approaching lunar disc every reason hope would last reach point lunar attraction last best decided fall result 
three friends need hardly said continued make observations redoubled interest redoubled interest possible 
care could yet determine nothing regarding topographical details radiant satellite 
surface still reflected solar rays dazzlingly show relief necessary satisfactory observation 
travellers kept steadily watch looking side lights till eight clock evening time moon grown large eyes covered fully half sky 
time projectile must looked like streak light reflecting sun brilliancy one side moon splendor 
barbican took careful observation calculated could much miles object journey 
velocity projectile calculated feet per second miles hour 
therefore still plenty time reach moon four hours 
though bottom projectile continued turn towards lunar surface obedience law centripetal force centrifugal force still evidently strong enough change path followed kind curve exact nature would exceedingly difficult calculate 
careful observations barbican continued take however prevent endeavoring solve difficult problem 
switched hours passed brought result 
adventurers approaching moon evident evident never reach 
nearest point projectile could ever possibly attain would result two opposite forces attractive repulsive clear influenced motion 
therefore land moon utter impossibility idea given ever 
quand cried ardan moments silence 
land moon well let us next best thing pass close enough discover secrets nicholl could accept situation coolly 
contrary decidedly lost temper occasionally case even phlegmatic men

mean replied barbican voice perfectly calm tone quiet conviction deviation due altogether wandering meteor 
even graze us cried ardan 
matter replied barbican 
mass compared enormous attraction undoubtedly sufficiently great influence deviation 
hardly enough appreciable urged nicholl 
right captain observed barbican 
remember observation made afternoon inch line even tenth part hair breadth wrong beginning journey thousand miles would sufficient make us miss moon chapter x observers moon 
barbican happy conjecture probably hit nail head 
divergency even second may amount millions miles lines long enough 
projectile certainly gone direct course whatever cause fact undoubted 
great pity 
daring attempt must end failure due altogether fortuitous accident human foresight could possibly taken precaution 
unless case occurrence improbable accident reaching moon evidently impossible 
failure therefore travellers make minds 
nothing gained trip though missing actual contact moon might pass near enough solve several problems physics geology scientists long time puzzling brains vain even would compensation trouble courage intelligence 
fate doom reserved never appeared think thing 
knew well midst infinite solitudes soon find without air

rather inclined believe one word ardan rhapsody ever heard barbican nicholl 
long spoken last words become mute statues eagerly watching pencil hand spyglass eye northern lunar hemisphere towards rapidly indirectly approaching 
fully made minds time leaving far behind central point would probably reached half hour ago shunted course inopportune bolide 
half past twelve clock barbican broke dead silence saying careful calculation miles moon surface distance two hundred miles less length lunar radius still diminished advanced north

accordingly travellers armed excellent telescopes power enough injury clearness posted unequalled vantage ground began already distinguish certain details probably never noticed terrestrial observers 
even ardan time quite recovered fit sentiment probably infected little scientific enthusiasm companions began observe note observe note alternately sangfroid veteran astronomer 
friends said barbican interrupting silence lasted perhaps ten minutes whither going say shall ever revisit earth tell 
still duty act respects labors one day service fellow creatures 
let us keep souls free every distraction

see mortal eye ever gazed 
projectile simply work room great cambridge observatory lifted space 
let us take observations words set work renewed ardor companions fully participated 
consequence soon several outline maps covered best sketches could make moon various aspects thus presented favorable circumstances

ordinary maps earth surface north top right hand must east left hand west 
simply look

mare sea according early astronomers plain solid sand according later authority immense forest according de la rue london far moon successful photographer gentleman authority ardan would given decided support famous dispute captain meeting near tampa says decidedly moon atmosphere low sure dense 
however must find meantime let us affirm nothing good grounds positive assertion

let us examine old copernicus grand crater deservedly considered one greatest lunar wonders 
lifts giant ramparts upwards feet level lunar surface 
quite visible earth well situated observation favorite object astronomical study particularly case phase existing last quarter new moon vast shadows projected boldly east towards west allow prodigious dimensions measured 
tycho situated southern hemisphere copernicus forms important radiating mountain lunar disc

wonderful complexity bright streaks diverging sides center presented scene alike splendid unique 
streaks travellers thought could traced north direction fancied could detect even mare imbrium course might owing point made observations 
one clock morning projectile flying space exactly magnificent mountain 
spite brilliant sunlight blazing around travellers could easily recognize peculiar features copernicus

like kepler aristarchus rule oceanus procellarum copernicus viewed telescopes sometimes glistens brightly ashy light moon frequently taken volcano full activity 
whatever may however certainly nothing like mountains visible side moon extinct volcano crater exceeding grandeur sublimity throw utterly shade everything like earth 
crater etna little mile across 
crater copernicus diameter least miles 
within travellers could easily discover glasses immense number terraced ridges probably landslips alternating stratifications resulting successive eruptions 
particularly southern side caught glimpses shadows intense blackness projected across plateau lying like pitch spots could tell yawning chasms incalculable depth 
outside crater shadows almost deep whilst plains around particularly west many small craters could detected eye vain attempted count 
many circular mountains kind observed barbican seen lunar surface copernicus though one greatest one remarkable account diverging streaks bright light see radiating summit 
looking steadily crater see cones mortal eye ever lit 
numerous render interior plateau quite rugged formerly many openings giving vent fire volcanic matter 
curious common arrangement internal plateau lunar craters lying lower level external plains quite contrary terrestrial crater generally bottom much higher level surrounding country 
follows therefore deep lying curve bottom ring mountains would give sphere diameter somewhat smaller moon cause peculiarity asked nicholl

copernicus vast ramparts formed perfect circle rather pair concentric circles 
around mountain extended dark grayish plain savage aspect peak shadows projected sharp relief 
gloomy bottom crater whose dimensions vast enough swallow mont blanc body bones could distinguished magnificent group cones least half mile height glittering like piles crystal 
towards north several breaches could seen ramparts due probably caving immense masses accumulated summit precipitous walls 
already observed surrounding plains dotted numberless craters mostly small dimensions except gay lussac north whose crater miles diameter 
towards southwest immediate east plain appeared flat protuberance prominence kind lifting general dead level 
towards north contrary far peninsula jutted oceanus procellarum plain looked like sea lava wildly lashed furious hurricane waves breakers driving ridges wildest suddenly frozen solidity 
rugged rumpled wrinkled surface directions ran wonderful streaks whose radiating point appeared summit copernicus 
many appeared ten miles wide hundreds miles length 
travellers disputed time origin strange radii could hardly said arrived conclusion satisfactory already reached terrestrial observers 
nicholl question streaks simply prolonged mountain crests reflecting sun rays vividly superior altitude comparative smoothness barbican readily replied streaks mountain crests certain conditions solar illumination project shadows thing never known circumstances whatever 
fact period full moon streaks seen soon sun rays become oblique disappear altogether proof appearance due altogether peculiar advantages surface reflection light 
dear boys allow give little guess subject asked ardan 
companions profuse expressing desire hear 
well resumed seeing bright streaks invariably start certain point radiate directions suppose streams lava issuing crater flowing mountain side cooled supposition something like put forth herschel replied barbican sense convince quite untenable consider lava however hot liquid may commencement journey flow hundreds miles hills across ravines plains time streams almost exactly equal width 
theory holds water mine ardan observed nicholl 
correct captain replied frenchman barbican trick knocking bottom every weaker vessel 
let us hear say subject 
theory 
barbican theory said barbican pretty much lately presented english astronomer nasmyth devoted much study reflection lunar matters 
course formulate theory affirm 
streaks cracks made moon surface cooling shrinkage volcanic matter forced internal pressure 
sinking ice frozen lake meeting sharp pointed rock cracks radiating manner every one fissures admits water immediately spreads laterally ice pretty much lava spreads lunar surface 
theory accounts radiating nature streaks great nearly equal thickness immense length inability cast shadow invisibility time except near full moon 
still nothing theory deny serious objections may brought 
know dear boys cried ardan led usual slightest fancy know thinking look great rugged plains spread beneath us say sure replied barbican somewhat piqued little attention secured theory 
well thinking asked nicholl 
spillikins answered ardan triumphantly 
spillikins cried companions somewhat surprised 
yes spillikins rocks blocks peaks streaks cones cracks ramparts escarpments set spillikins though acknowledge grand scale wish little hook pull one one illustration immense battlefield 
oh serious ardan cried barbican little impatiently 
certainly replied ardan 
let us serious captain since seriousness best befits subject hand 
think another comparison plain look like immense battle field piled bleaching bones myriads slaughtered man bidding mighty caesar think lofty comparison hey quite par muttered barbican

half past one looking right west saw summits another mountain barbican consulting map recognized eratosthenes 
ring mountain miles diameter like copernicus crater immense profundity containing central cones 
whilst directing glasses towards gloomy depths barbican mentioned friends kepler strange idea regarding formation ring mountains

natural one answered barbican 
selenites must undertaken immense labor digging enormous pits places refuge could protect fierce solar rays beat days succession bad idea selenites exclaimed ardan 
absurd idea cried nicholl 
probably kepler never knew real dimensions craters 
barbican knows trouble time required dig well stony hill nine hundred feet deep 
dig single lunar crater would take hundreds hundreds years even giants would attempt asked ardan 
moon gravity six times less earth labor selenites compared men like us 
suppose selenite six times smaller man like us urged nicholl 
suppose selenite never existence interposed barbican usual success putting end argument 
never mind selenites

lunar disc brought within distance six miles spy glasses fair question ask could aeronaut elevation earth discover surface present question hardly answered remarkable balloon ascensions never passed altitude five miles circumstances favorable observers 
however account carefully transcribed notes taken spot barbican companions see peculiar post observation 
varieties color first place appeared upon disc 
selenographers quite agreed nature colors 
colors without variety faint easily distinguished 
schmidt athens even says oceans earth evaporated observer moon would hardly find seas continents globe even well outlined moon eye terrestrial observer 
according shade color distinguishing vast plains known seas dark gray dashed green brown color presented also great craters 
opinion schmidt shared beer maedler barbican observations convinced far better founded certain astronomers admit color visible moon surface gray 
certain spots greenish tint quite decided particularly mare serenitatis mare humorum localities schmidt noticed 
barbican also remarked several large craters class interior cones reflected kind bluish tinge somewhat like given forth freshly polished steel plate 
tints saw enough convince proceeded really lunar surface due certain astronomers asserted either imperfections spy glasses interference terrestrial atmosphere 
singular opportunity correct observation allowed entertain doubt whatever subject 
hampered atmosphere free liability optical illusion 
satisfied therefore reality tints considered knowledge positive gain science 
greenish tint due dense tropical vegetation maintained low atmosphere mile thickness possibly 
another question could answered present

barbican companions succeeded better new problem soon engaged undivided attention 
deserves detail 
passed lambert timocharis attentively gazing magnificent crater archimedes diameter miles across ramparts feet height ardan startled companions suddenly exclaiming hello cultivated fields living man mean cultivated fields asked nicholl sourly wiping glasses shrugging shoulders 
certainly cultivated fields replied ardan 
see furrows certainly plain enough 
white glistening sun quite different radiating streaks copernicus 
sides perfectly parallel furrows asked nicholl putting glasses eye adjusting focus 
see directions answered ardan two particularly visible one running north archimedes south towards apennines 
nicholl face gazed gradually assumed grin soon developed snicker positive laugh observed ardan selenites must brobdignagians oxen leviathans ploughs bigger marston famous cannon furrows barbican asked ardan doubtfully unwilling submit nicholl 
furrows dear friend said barbican either simply account immense size

let us take good look

curious peculiarities lunar surface interested astronomic mind high degree first discovery proved perplexing problems ever since

even happened hit idea already suggested schmidt athens 
consider asked simple phenomena vegetation mean asked barbican

exactly worthy captain answered ardan quietly though perhaps nearer mark expected 
mean exactly rows sugar cane mean vast avenues trees poplars instance planted regularly side great high road 
still harping vegetation said captain 
ardan splendid historian spoiled less know facts readier account 
foi said ardan simply greatest scientific men guess 
difference however us call guesses guesses mere conjecture dignify profound theories astounding discoveries often case friend ardan often case said barbican 
question consideration however continued frenchman conjecture advantage others explains rills appear seem disappear regular intervals 
let us hear explanation said captain 
become invisible trees lose leaves reappear resume 
explanation without ingenuity observed barbican nicholl dear friend turning ardan hardly admissible 
probably said ardan sun nearly always vertical lunar equator moon change seasons worth mentioning therefore vegetation present none phenomena speak 
perfectly true 
slight obliquity moon axis keeps sun altitude whole year around 
equatorial regions always vertical polar never higher horizon 
therefore change seasons according latitude perpetual winter spring summer autumn whole year round 
state things almost precisely similar prevails jupiter also stands nearly upright orbit inclination axis 
account grooves hard nut crack 
must certainly later formation craters rings often found breaking right circular ramparts 
probably latest lunar features results last geological epochs due altogether expansion shrinkage acting large scale brought great forces nature operating manner altogether unknown earth

besides travellers found distance never reached powerful telescopes including even lord rosse great instrument rocky mountains 
barbican therefore condition singularly favorable resolve great question concerning moon inhabitableness 
nevertheless solution still escaped 
could discover nothing around dreary waste immense plains towards north beneath bare mountains aridest character 
slightest vestige man work could detected vast expanse 
slightest sign ruin spoke ever

exclaimed ardan disconcerted look long searching examination find anybody 
everything motionless street pompeii clock morning illustration solution still escaped 
good comparison friend ardan observed nicholl 
lava slag volcanic eminences vitreous matter glistening like ice piles scoria pitch black shadows dazzling streaks like rivers light breaking jagged rocks beneath eye alone detect man animal tree 
great american desert land milk honey comparison joyless orb moving 
however even yet predicate nothing positive 
atmosphere may taken refuge depths chasms interior craters even opposite side moon know still must remember observed barbican even sharpest eye detect man distance greater four miles half glasses yet brought us nearer five 
means say observed ardan though see selenites see projectile matters improved much towards four clock morning travellers found th parallel distance miles lunar surface

peaked mountain passed right asked ardan 
quite remarkable standing almost solitary grandeur barren plain 
pico answered barbican 
least feet high well known terrestrial astronomers well peculiar shadow account comparative isolation

another wonder almost front us cried ardan 
see vast lake black pitch round crater surrounded lofty mountains shadows reach clear across rendering interior quite invisible plato said nicholl know well darkest spot moon many night gazed little observatory broad street philadelphia 
right captain said barbican crater plato indeed generally considered blackest spot moon inclined consider spots grimaldi riccioli extreme eastern edge somewhat darker 
take glass ardan somewhat greater power distinctly see bottom crater 
reflective power plateau probably proceeds exceedingly great number small craters detect 
think see something like said ardan 
sorry projectile course give us vertical view

contrary nearer travellers approached lunar surface drearier inhospitable unearthly everything seem look 
still five clock morning brought travellers within miles mount gioja spy glasses rendered visible half mile ardan could control 
exclaimed touch hands open windows let mind letting go 
inviting quarters admit 
come jumping place want see whole thing 
open lower window let 
take care man said nicholl drily wants take jump miles better try friend ardan said barbican grimly think satellite moon attainable body projectile 
far comfortable floating empty space like bolide 
ardan unwilling quarrel companions appeared give secretly consoled hope entertaining time looked like assuming appearance certainty 
projectile lately approaching moon surface rapidly last seemed actually impossible finally touch somewhere neighborhood north pole whose dazzling ridges presented sharp strong relief black sky 
therefore kept silent quietly bided time 
projectile moved evidently getting nearer nearer lunar surface 
moon appeared travellers us towards beginning second quarter bright crescent instead hemisphere

shadow gleam slightest vestige could trace existence 
darkness profound dazzling splendor stars gave deeper blackness pitchy sky 
wonder 
travellers found night plenty time become black steep everything connected palpable blackness 
night hours long invisible face moon turned away sun 
black darkness projectile fully participated 
plunged moon shadow effectually cut action solar rays every point invisible lunar surface 
travellers longer able see proposed light gas though unexpected demand commodity scarce valuable certainly disquieting 
gas remembered intended heating alone illumination sun moon promised never ending supply 
sun moon single instant vanished eyes left stygian darkness 
sun fault cried ardan angrily trying throw blame something like every angry man circumstances bound rather nonsensical 
put saddle right horse ardan said nicholl patronizingly always delighted opportunity counting point frenchman 
mean moon fault setting like screen us sun cried ardan soothed friend patronizing tone sticking like man first assertion right wrong 
know say sun fault use gas nonsense said nicholl 
moon interposition cut sun light 
sun business allow cut said ardan still angry therefore decidedly loose assertions 
nicholl could reply barbican interposed even voice soon heard pouring balm troubled waters 
dear friends observed little reflection either side would convince present situation neither moon fault sun fault 
anything blamed projectile instead rigidly following allotted course awkwardly contrived deviate 
however strict justice must acquit even projectile 
obeyed great law nature shifting course soon came within sphere inopportune bolide influence 
right said ardan usual best humor barbican laid law 
doubt exactly say settled suppose take breakfast 
hard night spent work little refreshment would place proposition reasonable even nicholl oppose ardan turned gas everything ready meal minutes

toasts offered hurrahs uttered 
painful uneasiness seized hearts daring travellers 
darkness suddenly plunged told decidedly spirits 
felt almost suddenly deprived sight 
thick dismal savage blackness victor hugo pen fond occasionally revelling surrounded sides crushed like iron shroud 
felt worse ever breakfast ardan carefully turned gas everything within projectile dark without 
however though could see faces could hear voices therefore soon began talk 
natural subject conversation terrible night hours long laws nature imposed lunar inhabitants 
barbican undertook give friends explanation regarding cause startling phenomenon consequences resulting 
yes startling word observed barbican replying remark ardan still reflect lunar hemispheres deprived turns sun light nearly days also particular hemisphere moment floating long night completely deprived earth light 
words one side moon disc ever receives light earth 
nearly every portion one side moon earth always completely absent sun us midnight 
suppose analogous case existed earth suppose instance neither europe asia north america moon ever visible fact seen antipodes 
astonishment contemplate first time arrival australia new zealand every man us would pack australia see cried ardan 
yes said nicholl sententiously visit south sea turk would willingly forego mecca bostonian would prefer sidney even paris 
well resumed barbican interesting marvel reserved selenite inhabits side moon always turned away globe 
added captain unspeakable satisfaction contemplating arrived period sun earth side moon days sooner later 
part however continued barbican heeding interruptions must confess notwithstanding magnificent splendor spectacle viewed first time selenite inhabits dark side moon prefer resident illuminated side 
former long blazing roasting dazzling day night hours long whose darkness like surrounding us ever unrelieved save cold cheerless rays stars 
latter hardly seen fiery sun sinking one horizon beholds rising opposite one orb milder paler colder indeed sun fully large thirteen full moons therefore shedding thirteen times much light 
would earth 
would pass phases exactly like satellite 
selenites would new earth full earth last quarter 
midnight grandly illuminated would shine greatest glory 
almost much said 
futile heat would poorly compensate superior radiance 
calorie accumulated lunar soil hours day would time radiated completely space

bravo cried ardan clapping hands softly president sublime reminds overture guillaume tell souvenir de marston growled nicholl 
phenomena continued barbican heedless interruption voice betraying slight glow excitement phenomena going without interruption month month year year age age eon eon finally convinced asked hearers interrupting suddenly 
existence present time answered nicholl 
either animal vegetable life interrupted ardan 
moon hardly possible cried one voice 
besides asked barbican even life live dark side would much inconvenient light side cried nicholl promptly 
choice cried ardan ready 
part think residence mt erebus grinnell land terrestrial paradise comparison either 
earth shine might illuminate light side moon little long night practical advantage towards heat life would perfectly useless another serious difference two sides said barbican addition enumerated 
dark side actually troubled excessive variations temperature light one 
assertion worthy president interrupted ardan possible respect superior knowledge disposed question 
clear day said barbican 
clear mud mean mr president interrupted ardan temperature light side excited two objects time earth sun whereas beg pardon ardan said barbican 
granted dear boy granted utmost pleasure interrupted frenchman 
shall probably direct observations altogether captain continued barbican friend michael interrupts often afraid hardly understand remarks 
always admired candor barbican said ardan noble quality grand quality mention replied barbican turning towards nicholl still dark addressing exclusively see dear captain period moon invisible side receives light heat exactly period conjunction say lying earth sun 
comparison therefore place occupied opposition visible side fully illuminated nearer sun double distance earth nearly thousand miles 
therefore dear captain see invisible side moon turned towards sun nearly half million miles nearer 
therefore heat much greater 
see glance said captain 
whereas continued barbican 
one moment cried ardan 
another interruption exclaimed barbican meaning sir ask honorable friend privilege floor one moment cried ardan 
continue explanation 
show understand well interrupt floor exclaimed barbican voice longer showing traces ill humor 
expected less honorable gentleman well known courtesy replied ardan 
changing manner imitating life barbican voice articulation gestures continued whereas see dear captain period moon visible side receives light heat exactly period opposition say lying one side earth sun 
comparison therefore point occupied conjunction invisible side fully illuminated farther sun double distance earth nearly miles 
therefore dear captain readily see moon invisible side turned sun nearly half million miles 
therefore heat much less 
well done friend ardan cried barbican clapping hands pleasure 
yes captain understood well either us whole time 
intelligence indifference caused interrupt 
wonderful fellow kind man replied ardan without degree complacency 
added simply barbican friend understand explanations readily attribute astonishing lucidity 
faculity able scent common sense first glimmer 
sentences steeped catch full meaning long end hence apparent inattention 
yet done visible face moon seems yet enumerated advantages surpasses side 
another advantages continued barbican visible side alone eclipses sun seen 
self evident interposition earth possible visible face sun 
furthermore eclipses sun would far imposing character anything kind witnessed earth 
chiefly two reasons first terrestrians see sun eclipsed notice discs two orbs apparent size one hide except short time second two bodies moving opposite directions total duration eclipse even favorable circumstances last longer minutes 
whereas selenite sees earth eclipse sun earth disc appear four times larger sun also day times longer two heavenly bodies must remain several hours contact 
besides notwithstanding apparent superiority earth disc refracting power atmosphere never allow sun eclipsed altogether 
even completely screened earth would form beautiful circle around yellow red crimson light would appear float like vast sphere jet glowing sea gold rubies sparkling carbuncles garnets 
seems said nicholl taking everything consideration invisible side rather shabbily treated 
know stay long said ardan desire seeing splendid sight eclipse would enough bring visible side soon possible 
yes doubt friend michael pursued barbican see eclipse would necessary quit dark hemisphere altogether 
course aware consequence librations noddings wobblings moon presents eyes earth little exact half disc 
two motions one path around earth shifting around axis endeavors keep side always turned towards sphere 
always one motion latter strictly uniform eccentric sometimes accelerating sometimes retarding time shift around completely perfect correspondence movement 
perigee instance moves forward quicker shift detect portion western border time conceal 
similarly apogee rate motion comparatively slow shifts little quickly velocity therefore help revealing certain portion eastern border 
shows altogether degrees dark side east west degrees words little per cent entire surface becomes visible human eyes 
consequently selenite could catch occasional glimpse earth without altogether quitting dark side 
matter cried ardan ever become selenites must inhabit visible side 
weak point light must got 
unless perhaps case might paying dear observed nicholl 
would like pay light loss atmosphere according philosophers piled away dark side ah case consider little committing replied ardan like hear opinion regarding notion barbican 
hey hear astronomers valid reasons supposing atmosphere fled dark side moon defer question till time ardan whispered nicholl barbican thinking something interests far deeply empty speculation astronomers 
near window look towards moon 
see anything feel window hand see might well head ears hogshead ink

cries struggles groans smothered beneath impenetrable tomb eternal silence fanciful ideas ardan tried amuse companions present unsatisfactory state affairs 
efforts however well meant successful 
nicholl growls savage usual even barbican patience decidedly giving way 
loss face could easily borne details already familiar 
must dark face escaped observation one numberless reasons actually dying see looked windows black moon beneath 
lay round black spot hiding sweet faces stars otherwise distinguishable travellers lying depths mammoth cave kentucky 
think 
fifteen days dark face splendidly illuminated solar beams every crater lustrous every peak sparkling every streak glistening vertical ray 
fifteen days later day light brilliant would replaced midnight cimmerian 
fifteen days later would projectile direction would drawn forces innumerable attractions incalculable question even ardan would reply ominous shake head 
know already travellers well astronomers generally judging portion dark side occasionally revealed moon librations pretty certain great difference two sides far regards physical constitutions 
portion seventh part shows plains mountains circles craters precisely nature already laid chart 
judging therefore analogy three sevenths probability world every respect exactly like visible face arid desert dead 
travellers also knew pretty certain far quite certain arguing merely analogy may enable give good guess never lead undoubted conclusion 
atmosphere really withdrawn dark face air water would enough infuse life whole continent vegetation flourish plains fish seas animals forests man every one zones capable sustaining life interesting questions satisfaction would able answer positively one way another thousands difficult problems mere glimpse hemisphere would enough furnish satisfactory reply 
glorious would contemplate realm eye man never yet rested great therefore may readily conceive depression travellers spirits pursued way enveloped veil darkness profound 
still even ardan usual formed somewhat exception 
finding impossible see particle lunar surface gave good tried console gazing stars fairly blazed spangled heavens 
certainly never astronomer enjoyed opportunity gazing heavenly bodies peculiar advantages 
fraye paris chacornac lyons father secchi rome would envied candidly truly speaking never mortal eye revelled scene starry splendor

ardan eye could take whole extent easy sweep southern cross little bear thus embracing within one glance two polar stars present day also campus vega reason precession equinoxes polar stars years hence 
imagination intoxicated reeled wildly sublime infinitudes got lost

disagreeable sensation however time struggling last put end contemplations compelled think 
nothing less pretty sharp cold first somewhat endurable soon covered inside surface window panes thick coating ice 
fact sun direct rays longer opportunity warming projectile latter began lose rapidly radiation whatever heat stored away within walls 
consequence decided falling thermometer thick condensation internal moisture window glasses soon render external observations extremely difficult actually impossible 
captain oldest man party claimed privilege saying could stand longer 
striking light consulted thermometer cried seventeen degrees zero centigrade certainly low enough make old fellow like feel rather chilly one degree half zero fahrenheit observed barbican really idea cold 
teeth actually chattered much could hardly articulate still well others disliked entrench short supply gas 
one feature journey particularly admire said ardan trying laugh freezing lips complain monotony 
one time frying heat blinded light like indians caught burning prairie another freezing pitchy darkness hyperborean winter like sir john franklin merry men bay boothia 
madame la nature forget devotees contrary overwhelm us attentions external temperature may reckoned much asked captain making desperate effort keep conversation 
temperature outside projectile must precisely interstellar space general answered barbican 
precisely moment interposed ardan quickly making experiment could never made long sunshine exclaimed barbican never glad thought ardan 
position find temperature space actual experiment see whose calculations right fourier pouillet let see asked ardan fourier pouillet baron fourier french academy wrote famous treatise heat remember reading twenty years ago penington book store promptly responded captain pouillet eminent professor physics sorbonne died last year think 
thank captain said ardan cold injure memory though decidedly advance 
see thick ice already window panes let keep shall soon breaths falling around us flakes snow 
let us prepare thermometer said barbican already set work business like manner 
thermometer usual kind may readily supposed would use whatever experiment made 
ordinary thermometer mercury freezes hard exposed temperature zero 
barbican provided minimum self recording thermometer peculiar nature invented wolferdin friend arago could correctly register exceedingly low degrees temperature 
beginning experiment instrument tested comparison one usual kind barbican hesitated moments regarding best means employing 
shall start experiment asked captain 
nothing simpler answered ardan always ready reply open windows fling thermometer 
follows projectile calf follows mother 
quarter hour put hand put hand interrupted barbican 
put hand continued ardan quietly 
nothing kind interrupted barbican unless prefer instead hand pull back frozen stump shapeless colorless lifeless prefer hand said ardan surprised interested 
yes continued barbican instant hand left projectile would experience terrible sensations produced cauterizing iron bar white hot 
heat whether rushing rapidly bodies rapidly entering identically force amount damage 
besides means certain still followed objects flung projectile 
asked nicholl saw outside long ago 
see outside answered barbican may accounted know darkness may also fact 
case like rely uncertainties 
therefore make sure losing thermometer shall fasten string easily pull whenever like 
advice adopted window opened quickly instrument thrown nicholl held fastened short stout cord could pulled immediately 
window hardly open longer second yet second enough admit terrible icy chill interior projectile 
ten thousand ice bergs cried ardan shivering cold enough freeze white bear barbican waited quietly half hour time considered quite long enough enable instrument acquire temperature interstellar space

madame moon becomes cold every time surface withdrawn sunlight fourteen days think boys hospitality much hanker chapter xv

donnez te baiss e go baldheaded showed ardan uncalculating impetuosity celtic blood

whilst nicholl screw valve let rip betrayed unconquerable yankee coolness old experiences western steamboat captain 
eight clock morning day called america sixth december near moon certainly near enough fact perceive easily dark great round screen formed projectile one side earth sun stars 
exact distance lay possible means calculating 
projectile impelled maintained forces inexplicable even incomprehensible come within less thirty miles moon north pole 
two hours immersion dark shadow distance increased diminished evidently stand point whereby estimate either projectile direction velocity 
perhaps moving rapidly away moon would soon shadow altogether 
perhaps contrary gradually approaching surface might come contact moment sharp invisible peak lunar mountains catastrophe sure put sudden end trip travellers 
excited discussion subject soon sprang naturally took part 
ardan imagination usual getting better reason maintained warmly projectile caught retained moon attraction could help falling surface aerolite help falling earth 
softly dear boy softly replied barbican aerolites help falling earth proof fall therefore even granting already assumed nature aerolite necessarily follow fall moon 
objected ardan approach near enough see help see may said barbican see reflect moment 
often seen november meteors instance streaking skies thousands time yes several occasions fortunate 
well ever see strike earth surface asked barbican 
say ever candid reply well shooting stars continued barbican rather wandering particles matter shine inflamed friction atmosphere 
therefore never greater distance earth miles furthest yet seldom fall 
projectile 
may go close moon without falling 
roving projectile must pull somewhere long run replied ardan like know somewhere moon 
softly dear boy said barbican know projectile must pull somewhere self evident replied ardan keep moving ever 
whether depends altogether one two mathematical curves followed describing course 
according velocity endowed certain moment must follow either one velocity consider able calculate 
exactly chimed nicholl must describe keep describing either parabola hyperbola 
precisely said barbican certain velocity would take parabolic curve velocity considerably greater describe hyperbolic curve 
always like nice corpulent words said ardan trying laugh bloated unwieldy express neat handy way exactly mean 
course know high high high curves low curves 
matter 
explain 
consider deplorably ignorant nature curves 
well said captain little bumptiously parabola curve second order formed intersection cone plane parallel one sides 
say cried ardan mouth agape 
tell pretty nearly path taken shell shot mortar 
well observed ardan apparently much surprised thought high high bully old curve hyperbola continued captain minding ardan antics hyperbola curve second order formed intersection cone plane parallel axis rather parallel two generatrices constituting two separate branches extending indefinitely directions 
oh accomplished scientist going turn left long enough feet illustrious maestro cried ardan effusion 
figure boys captain lucid explanations fully expected hear something high curves low curves back ancient thomas oh michael michael know captain earlier captain deeply interested hot discussion barbican notice frenchman funning 
two curves one probably taken projectile barbican maintained parabolic nicholl insisted hyperbolic 
tempers improved severe cold became rather excited dispute 
drew many lines table crossed often others nothing left last great blot 
covered bits paper x read like many classic passages shouting declaiming drawing attention strong points gesticulation forcible voice loud neither disputants could hear word said 
possibly great difference temperature external air contact skin blood coursing veins given rise magnetic currents potential effects superabundant supply oxygen 
events language soon began employ enforcement arguments fairly made frenchman hair stand end 
probably forget important difference directrix axis hotly observed barbican 
know abscissa cried captain 
say much ever understand meant double ordinate asked barbican trying keep cool 
ever transverse conjugate replied captain much asperity 
one convinced glance eccentricity equal unity must blind bat exclaimed barbican fast losing ordinary urbanity 
less unity mean want spectacles mine shouted captain angrily tearing offering adversary 
dear boys interposed ardan eccentricity equal unity cried barbican 
eccentricity less unity screamed nicholl 
talking eccentricity put ardan 
therefore parabola must cried barbican triumphantly 
therefore hyperbola nothing shorter captain quite confident reply 
gracious sake resumed ardan 
produce asymptote exclaimed barbican angry sneer 
let us see symmetrical point roared captain quite savagely 
dear boys old fellows cried ardan loud lungs would let 
useless argue mississippi steamboat captain ejaculated barbican never gives till blows never try convince yankee schoolmaster replied nicholl one book heart believe friend michael get cord way convince cried barbican hastily turning frenchman 
hand ruler ardan yelled captain 
heavy one way left bring reason look barbican nicholl cried ardan last making heard keeping tight hold cord ruler 
thing gone far enough come 
stop talk answer questions 
want cord barbican describe parabolic curve going ruler nicholl help draw true hyperbola promise barbican going lasso captain lasso captain ha ha ha promise nicholl going brain president brain president ho ho ho want merely convince parabola want make clear day hyperbola make real difference whether one yelled ardan 
greatest possible difference eye science 
radical incontrovertible difference eye science oh hang eye science either curve take us moon either take us back earth either take us anywhere know open curves therefore never end slightest possible importance two curves controls projectile slightest except eye science let eye science parabolas hyperbolas conjugates asymptotes rest confounded nonsensical farrago go pot use bothering heads enough trouble otherwise nice pair scientists stanislow scientists probably 
real scientists lose tempers trifle ever see ideal true scientific man flesh barbican came near realizing idea perfectly see science little effect culture driving old adam us idea simpleton lot lecture others propriety deportment thought going tear eyes ha ha ha impayable give cord michael hand heavy ruler ardan way bring reason ho ho ho good shall never get laughed till sides ached cheeks streamed 
laughter contagious merriment genuine really resisting next minutes witnessed nothing laughing handshaking rib punching projectile though heaven knows little poor fellows merry 
could neither reach moon return earth befall immediate outlook reverse exhilarating 
die hunger die thirst reason would simply days soon gas exhausted would die want air unless indeed icy cold killed beforehand time fact temperature become exceedingly cold encroachment little stock gas could put longer 
light course could manage without little heat absolutely necessary prevent freezing death 
fortunately however caloric developed reiset regnault process purifying air raised internal temperature projectile little expenditure gas much less expected travellers able maintain degree capable sustaining human life 
time also observations windows become exceedingly difficult 
internal moisture condensed thick congealed hard glass nothing short continued friction could keep transparency 
friction however laborious might regard times thought little observation become far interesting important ever 
moon atmosphere travellers near enough strike meteor might rushing 
projectile floating possible would good conductor sound convey ears reflexion lunar echo roar storm raging among mountains rattling plunging avalanche detonations eructating volcano suppose lunar etna vesuvius flashing fires even possible eye could catch glimpse lurid gleam one two facts kind well attested would singularly elucidate vexatious question lunar atmosphere still far decided 
full thoughts intensely interested barbican nicholl ardan patient astronomers transit venus watched steadily windows allowed nothing worth noticing escape searching gaze 
ardan patience first gave 
showed observation natural enough matter mind unaccustomed long stretches careful thought darkness absolutely killing ever take trip must time new moon agree ardan observed captain 
would time start 
moon grant would lost solar rays therefore invisible time trip compensation full earth full view 
besides chief point doubt ardan happen drawn round moon present moment enjoy inestimable advantage beholding invisible side magnificently illuminated idea exactly captain said ardan 
opinion point barbican opinion follows answered barbican gravely 
ever repeat journey shall start precisely time precisely circumstances 
forget object reach moon 
suppose really landed expected yesterday would much agreeable behold lunar continents enjoying full light day find plunged dismal obscurity night would first installation discovery circumstances decidedly extremely favorable silence shows agree 
invisible side landed power visit pleased therefore could always choose whatever time would best suit purpose 
therefore wanted land moon period full moon best period select 
period well chosen time well calculated force well applied projectile well aimed missing way spoiled everything 
sound logic doubt said ardan still help thinking want little light losing probably forever splendid opportunity seeing moon invisible side 
planets barbican think inhabitants ignorant regarding satellites regarding subject observed nicholl could venture answer though course without pretending speak dogmatically open question 
satellites planets comparative proximity must much easier study moon 
saturnians uranians jovians serious difficulty effecting communication satellites 
jupiter four moons instance though average actually times farther planet center moon us comparatively four times nearer account radius eleven times greater earth saturn eight moons case almost precisely similar 
average distance nearly three times greater moon saturn diameter times greater earth bodyguards really times nearer principal us 
uranus first satellite ariel half far moon earth comparatively though actually eight times nearer 
therefore said barbican taking subject experiment analogous starting either three planets would encountered fewer difficulties 
whole question resolves 
jovians rest able quit planets probably succeeded discovering invisible sides satellites 
able bit wiser matter projectile certainly shifting shifting certainly 
path described swung blindly darkness could laid chart want starting point barbican companions soon became aware decided modification relative position regard moon surface 
instead side heretofore presented base moon disc axis become rigidly vertical lunar horizon 
new feature journey barbican assured undoubted proof towards four clock morning 
cause gravity course 
heavier portion projectile gravitated towards moon center exactly falling towards surface 
falling last contrary expectations reach goal ardently wishing sight point discovered nicholl soon convinced barbican projectile far ever approaching moon moving around curve pretty near concentric 
nicholl discovery luminous gleam flickering distant verge black disc engrossed complete attention travellers set divining course 
could possibly confounded star 
glare reddish like distant furnace dark night kept steadily increasing size brightness thus showing beyond doubt projectile moving direction luminous point vertically falling towards moon surface 
volcano cried captain great excitement volcano full blast outlet moon internal fires therefore burnt cinder certainly looks like volcano replied barbican carefully investigating new puzzling phenomenon night glass 
one fact maintain combustion commenced ardan syllogistically sententiously air necessary 
undoubted case combustion lies us 
therefore part moon must atmosphere perhaps observed barbican necessarily 
volcano decomposing certain substances gunpowder instance may able furnish oxygen thus explode vacuum 
blaze fact seems possess intensity blinding glare objects burning pure oxygen 
let us therefore hasty jumping conclusion existence lunar atmosphere 
fire mountain situated according plausible conjecture somewhere neighborhood th degree south latitude moon invisible side

exceedingly narrow exceedingly fortunate escape projectile 
danger unlikely unexpected 
would ever dreamed even possibility encounter danger sight one erratic bolides certainly justified gravest apprehensions travellers regarding existence others 
worse sunken reefs southern seas snags mississippi could projectile expected avoid drifting along blindly boundless ethereal ocean inmates even saw danger totally powerless turn aside 
like ship without rudder like runaway horse like collapsed balloon like iceberg atlantic storm like boat niagara rapids moved sullenly recklessly mechanically mayhap jaws frightful danger bright intelligences within able modify motions even finger breadth able affect mercury movements around sun

glorious momentary glance worth whole lifetime ordinary existence revealed mortal ken continents oceans forests 
also convince existence atmosphere surface whose vivifying molecules would render life possible question leave unanswered hardly ever answered way quite satisfactory human curiosity 
still infinite satisfaction hovered even instant verge great problem solution 
half past three afternoon 
projectile still pursued curving otherwise unknown path moon invisible face 
path disturbed dangerous meteor every reason fear though disturbance disturbance curve described still one strictly accordance laws mechanical philosophy 
whether parabola hyperbola however whether disturbed made little difference case projectile bound quit pretty soon cone shadow point directly opposite entered 
cone could possibly great extent considering slight ratio borne moon diameter compared sun still appearances projectile seemed quite deeply immersed shadow ever apparently slightest sign state things coming soon end 
rate projectile moving hard say certainly slowly certainly rapidly enough shadow time describing curve rigidly parabolic 
curve therefore parabolic another puzzling problem sadly bewildering poor barbican almost lost reason attempting clear questions proving altogether profound overworked brains 
ever thought taking rest 
companions thought taking rest 
far 
senses high strung ever still watched carefully every new fact every unexpected incident might throw light sidereal investigations 
even dinner called consisted bits bread meat distributed ardan five clock swallowed mechanically 
even turn gas full head see eating man stood solidly window glass enough keeping free rapidly condensing moisture 
half past five however nicholl gazing time telescope particular direction called attention companions bright specks light barely discernible part horizon towards projectile evidently moving 
words hardly uttered companions announced discovery 
could soon see glittering specks becoming numerous also gradually assuming shape extremely slender extremely brilliant crescent 
rapidly brilliant decided shape profile gradually grew till soon resembled first faint sketch new moon catch evenings western sky rather first glimpse get limb slowly moves eclipse 
inconceivably brighter either furthermore strangely relieved pitchy blackness sky moon 
fact soon became brilliant dispel moment doubt particular nature 
meteor could present perfect shape volcano dazzling splendor 
sun cried barbican 
sun asked nicholl ardan astonishment 
yes dear friends sun see summits behold gilding mountains lie moon southern rim 
rapidly nearing south pole 
doubling north pole cried ardan must circumnavigating exactly sailing around 
hurrah right last nothing fear hyperbolas parabolas open curves nothing certainly open curve every thing closed one 
closed curve called trouble eclipse called trouble instead flying boundless regions space projectile probably describe elliptical orbit around moon cried nicholl amazement satellite ever right proper said ardan one dear friend said barbican ardan change curve involves change doom projectile 
infallibly lost ellipse parabola 
well one thing never could reconcile whole arrangement replied ardan cheerfully destruction open curve 
safe could say fate worst besides believe infallibility ellipsic 
may prove unreliable hyperbola 
harm hope may present appearances little justify ardan hope 
barbican theory elliptic orbit unfortunately well grounded allow single reasonable doubt expressed regarding projectile fate 
gravitate ever around moon sub satellite 
new born individual astral universe microcosm little world containing however three inhabitants even destined perish pretty soon want air 
travellers therefore particular reason rejoicing new destiny reserved projectile obedience inexorable laws centripetal centrifugal forces 
soon true opportunity beholding illuminated face moon 
might even live long enough catch last glimpse distant earth bathed glory solar rays 
might even strength enough left able chant one solemn final eternal adieu dear old mother world upon whose features mortal eyes never rest love longing projectile become inert lifeless extinct mass particle better defunct asteroid wanders blindly fields ether 
gloomy fate look forward 
yet instead grieving inevitable bold travellers actually felt thrilled delight prospect even momentary deliverance gloomy depths darkness finding even hours cheerful precincts illuminated genial light blessed sun ring light meantime becoming brighter brighter barbican long discovering pointing companions different mountains lay around moon south pole 
leibnitz right said left easily see peaks doerfel 
belonging rather moon dark side earth side visible terrestrial astronomers highest northern latitudes 
faint peaks beyond catch difficulty must newton curtius 
world tell asked ardan 
highest mountains circumpolar regions replied barbican 
measured greatest care newton feet high 
less laughed ardan 
delphic oracle says dear friend replied barbican quietly visible mountains moon measured carefully accurately hardly hesitate affirming altitude well known mont blanc least chief peaks himalayahs rocky mountain range 
like know people set observed ardan incredulously 
several well known methods approaching problem replied barbican methods though founded different principles bring us constantly result may pretty safely conclude calculations right 
time draw diagrams express clearly doubt easily catch general principle 
go ahead answered ardan 
anything algebra 
want algebra said barbican enable us find principles though certainly enables us apply 
well 
sun certain altitude shines one side mountain flings shadow 
length shadow easily found means telescope whose object glass provided micrometer 
consists simply two parallel spider threads one stationary movable 
moon real diameter known occupying certain space object glass exact space occupied shadow easily ascertained means movable thread 
space compared moon space give us length shadow 
circumstances certain height cast certain shadow course knowledge one must give vice versa 
method stated roughly followed galileo day beer maedler extraordinary success 
certainly see sense method said ardan took extraordinary pains observe correctly 
least carelessness would set wrong feet miles 
time enough however listen another method get full blaze glorious old sol 
method interrupted nicholl laying telescope rest eyes joining conversation give something called tangent rays 
solar ray barely passing edge moon surface caught peak mountain rest lies shadow 
distance starry peak line separating light darkness measure carefully means telescope 
see glance interrupted ardan lighting eye ray tangent course makes right angles radius known consequently two sides one angle quite enough find parts triangle 
ingenious think method absolutely impracticable every mountain except immediate neighborhood light shadow line defect easily remedied patience explained barbican captain like interrupted withdrawn telescope line continually changing course time mountains must come near 
third method measure mountain profile directly means micrometer evidently applicable altitudes lying exactly lunar rim 
clear enough said ardan another point also clear 
full moon measurement possible 
shadows made none measured 
measurements right wrong possible solar rays strike moon surface obliquely regard observer 
right signor barbicani maestro illustrissimo perfectly right replied barbican 
apt pupil 
say said ardan 
want mac hear 
barbican humored repeating observation nicholl would notice grunt doubtful meaning 
galileo tolerably successful calculations asked ardan resuming conversation 
answering question barbican unrolled map moon faint light like day break enabled examine 
went galileo wonderfully successful considering telescope employed poor instrument construction magnifying thirty times 
gave lunar mountains height feet altitude cut hevelius almost doubled riccioli 
herschel first come pretty close truth beer maedler whose mappa selenographica lies us left really nothing done lunar astronomy except course pay personal visit moon tried fear poor prospect success 
cheer cheer cried ardan 
yet long odds 
say still store us another bolide may shunt us ellipse even send us moon surface 
seeing barbican shake head ominously countenance become depressed true friend tried brighten bit feigning take deep interest subject absolutely driest world 
meer baedler mean beer maedler went must measured least forty fifty mountains satisfaction 
forty fifty exclaimed barbican 
measured fewer thousand ninety five lunar mountains crater summits perfect success 
six reach altitude upwards feet twenty two feet high 
highest lot asked ardan keenly relishing barbican earnestness 
doerfel southern hemisphere peak pointed highest lunar mountains far measured replied barbican 
nearly feet high 
indeed five thousand feet lower mount everest still lunar mountain quite respectable altitude 
respectable enormous altitude dear friend compare moon diameter 
earth diameter times greater moon earth mountains bore ratio moon everest sixteen miles high whereas quite six 
general heights himalayahs compare highest lunar mountains asked ardan wondering would next question 
fifteen peaks eastern higher division himalayahs higher loftiest lunar peaks replied barbican 
even western lower section himalayahs peaks exceed doerfel 
chief lunar mountains exceed mont blanc altitude asked ardan bravely suppressing yawn 
following dozen ranged memory fail exact order respective heights replied barbican never wearied answering questions newton curtius casatus rheita short huyghens biancanus tycho kircher clavius endymion catharina

careful observations taken barbican repeated companions soon satisfied ridgy outline mountains moon border though perhaps due different forces acting center still presented character generally uniform 
bulwark surrounded hollows abrupt projections surface 
yet different arrangement barbican pointed companions might naturally expected 
central portion disc moon crust solidification must subjected two attractions moon earth acting however contrary directions therefore certain sense serving neutralize 
towards border disc contrary terrestrial attraction acted direction perpendicular lunar exerted greater power therefore given different shape general contor 
remarkable difference far perceived terrestrial observers none could detected travellers 
therefore moon must found alone principle shape superficial development owed nothing external influences 
arago perfectly right therefore concluded barbican remarkable opinion gave expression thirty years ago external action whatever contributed formation moon diversified surface 
think barbican asked captain every force internal external might modify moon shape ceased long ago rather inclined opinion said barbican however new one

puzzling questions 
projectile passed little beyond tycho immense concavity barbican friends good opportunity observing brilliant streaks sent wonderfully flying directions celebrated mountain common center 
examined time closest attention 
could nature radiating aureola geological phenomena could blazing coma possibly produced questions natural things world barbican companions propound indeed every astronomer beginning time probably end 
see see anybody see clear night moon full friends advantages closer view 
tycho focus radiated directions head peeled orange hundred luminous streaks channels edges raised middle depressed perhaps vice versa owing optical illusion least twelve miles wide fully thirty 
certain directions ran distance least six hundred miles seemed especially towards west northwest north cover half southern hemisphere 
one flashes extended far neander th meridian another curving around furrow mare nectaris came end chain pyrenees course perhaps little seven hundred miles 
east barred luminous network mare nubium even mare humorum 
puzzling feature glittering streaks ran course directly onward apparently neither obstructed valley crater mountain ridge however high 
started said one common focus tycho crater 
certainly seemed emanate 
could rivers lava vomited center resistless volcanic agency afterwards crystallized glassy rock idea herschel barbican hesitation qualifying exceedingly absurd 
rivers running perfectly straight lines across plains well mountains astronomers continued looked streaks peculiar kind moraines long lines erratic blocks belched forth mighty power period tycho upheaval 
like theory barbican asked captain 
particle better herschel reply volcanic action could project rocks distance six seven hundred miles talk laying regularly detect break 
happy thought cried ardan suddenly seems tell cause radiating streaks let us hear said barbican 
certainly ardan reply streaks parts call star made stone striking ice ball pane glass 
bad smiled barbican approvingly hand flung stone threw ball hand hardly necessary replied ardan means disconcerted ball say comet nicholl laughed loud ardan seriously irritated 
however could say anything cutting enough make captain mind manners barbican quickly resumed dear friend let comets alone beg old astronomers fled occasions made explain every difficulty comets used long ago interrupted nicholl 
yes went barbican serenely judge comets said fallen surface meteoric showers crushed crater cavities comets dried water comets whisked atmosphere comets done everything 
pure assumption case however friend michael comet whatever necessary 
shock gave rise great star may come interior rather exterior 
violent contraction lunar crust process cooling may given birth gigantic star formation 
accept amendment said ardan best humor looking triumphantly nicholl 
english scientist continued barbican nasmyth name decidedly opinion especially ever since little experiment confirmed 
filled glass globe water hermetically sealed plunged hot bath 
enclosed water expanding greater rate glass burst latter made vast number cracks diverging every direction focus disruption 
something like conceives taken place around tycho 
crust cooled cracked 
lava interior oozing spread sides cracks 
certainly explains pretty satisfactorily flat glistening streaks much greater width fissures lava first made way surface 
well done englishman cried ardan great spirits 
englishman said nicholl glad opportunity coming credit 
famous scotch engineer invented steam hammer steam ram discovered willow leaves sun disc 
better better said ardan powers vulcan makes hot actually roasting observation hardly necessary make companions conscious time felt extremely uncomfortable 
heat become quite oppressive 
natural caloric sun reflected caloric moon projectile fast turning regular bake oven 
transition intense cold intense heat already quite much could bear 
shall barbican asked ardan seeing time one else appeared inclined say word 
nothing least yet awhile friend ardan replied barbican watching thermometer carefully last minutes though present centigrade fahrenheit noticed mercury slowly falling 
also easily remark floor projectile turning away lunar surface 
conclude quite confidently see captain agrees danger death intense heat though decidedly alarming ten minutes ago present time least may dismissed consideration 
sorry said ardan cheerfully neither baked like pie oven roasted like fat goose fire kind death like die 
yet death would suffer friends selenites exposed every day lives said captain evidently determined getting argument 
understand full bearing allusion dear captain replied ardan quickly tone showing disposed second nicholl expectations 
fact fast losing old habits positivism 
latterly seen much reflected 
deeper reflected inclined become accept conclusion less knew 
hence decided nicholl wanted argument 
speculative disputes henceforth avoid would listen pleasure could urged side might even skirmish little spirit moved regular pitched battle subject purely speculative fully determined never enter 
yes dear captain continued pointed arrow means missed mark deny faith beginning call little shaky existence friends selenites 
however like square opinion matter 
barbican also 
witnessed many strange lunar phenomena lately closer clearer mortal eye ever rested 
seen confirmed theory confounded hypothesis seen enough induce adopt decided conclusions put question formally 
think moon resembles earth abode animals intelligent beings come answer messieurs 
yes think answer question categorically replied barbican modify form little 
put question way please said ardan answer particular form 
good said barbican question double one demands double answer 
first moon inhabitable second moon ever inhabited way go said captain 
ardan say first question yes really say anything replied ardan 
presence distinguished scientists listener mere looker vienna divine williams 
however sake argument suppose reply affirmative say moon inhabitable 
shall unhesitatingly contradict said barbican feeling splendid humor carrying argument course sake contradicting conquering crushing showing vulgar weakness lower minds noble indeed motive impel philosopher enlightening convincing taking negative side however saying moon inhabitable shall satisfied merely negative arguments 
many words however required 
look present condition atmosphere dwindled away lowest ebb seas dried nearly waters reduced next nothing vegetation existing existing scantiest scale transitions intense heat intense cold testify sudden extreme nights days nearly hours long 
positively nothing know positively little hesitation saying moon appears absolutely uninhabitable 
seems unpropitious development animal kingdom actually incapable sustaining life sense usually attach term 
saving clause well introduced friend barbican said nicholl seeing chance demolishing ardan yet made mind another little bout president 
surely would venture assert moon uninhabitable race beings organization different question captain replied barbican though much difficult one shall try answer 
first however let us see captain agree fundamental points 
detect existence life movement motion result matter may organization well said captain drawling way guess may grant 
dear friends resumed barbican must remind though privilege observing lunar continents distance one third mile never yet caught sight first thing moving surface 
presence humanity even lowest type would revealed form boundaries buildings even ruins 
seen everywhere always geological works nature nowhere never orderly labors man 
therefore representatives animal life exist moon must taken refuge bottomless abysses eyes unable track 
even admit 
could always remain cavities 
atmosphere moon must found immense low lying plains 
plains inhabitants must often passed plains must way left mark trace vestige existence even road 
know well nowhere traces visible therefore exist therefore lunar inhabitants exist except course race beings imagine could exist without revealing existence movement 
say broke ardan give conceived sharper point barbican cogent arguments race beings could exist without existing precisely said barbican life without movement life equivalent expressions 
captain said ardan gravity could assume anything say moderator little debating society gives opinion arguments regarding question house present said captain biding time 
resumed ardan rising much dignity committee lunar explorations appointed honorable baltimore gun club solemnly assembled projectile belonging aforesaid learned respectable society carefully weighed arguments advanced side question also carefully considered new facts bearing case lately come personal notice said committee unanimously decides negatively question chair investigation namely moon inhabitable barbican chairman committee empower duly record solemn decision moon inhabitable 
barbican opening note book made proper entry among minutes meeting december th 
gentlemen continued ardan ready second question necessary complement first may well approach 
propound discussion following form moon ever inhabited captain committee would delighted hear remarks subject 
gentlemen began captain reply formed opinion regarding ancient inhabitability satellite long ever dreamed testing theory anything like present journey 
add observations far made served confirm opinion 
venture assert every kind probability favor also consider excellent arguments moon inhabited race beings possessing organization similar produced animals anatomically resembling terrestrial animals living organizations human animal day day vanished ages ages ago consequently life extinguished forever never reveal existence form 
chair asked ardan infer honorable gentleman observations considers moon world much older earth exactly replied captain without hesitation rather mean say moon world grew old rapidly earth came maturity earlier ripened quicker stricken old age sooner 
owing difference volumes two worlds organizing forces matter must comparatively much violent interior moon interior earth 
present condition surface see lying beneath us moment places assertion beyond possibility doubt 
wrinkled pitted knotted furrowed scarred nothing show earth resembles 
moon earth called existence creator probably period time 
first stages existence seem anything better masses gas 
acted upon various forces various influences course directed omnipotent intelligence gases degrees became liquid liquids grew condensed solids solidity could retain shape 
two heavenly bodies though starting time developed different ratio 
undoubtedly globe still gaseous liquid period moon already hardened cooling began become inhabitable 
undoubtedly good observed ardan admiringly 
period continued learned captain atmosphere surrounded 
waters shut gaseous envelope could longer evaporate 
combined influences air water light solar heat well internal heat vegetation began overspread continents time ready receive undoubtedly mean incontestably epoch life manifested lunar surface 
say incontestably advisedly nature never exhausts producing useless things therefore world wonderfully inhabitable must necessity inhabitants 
like necessity said ardan could never keep still always felt arguments call little shaky 
dear captain observed barbican taken consideration peculiarities satellite decidedly opposed development vegetable animal existence nights days instance hours long considered answered brave captain 
days nights enormous length would present time grant give rise variations temperature altogether intolerable ordinary organization 
things quite different era alluded 
time atmosphere enveloped moon gaseous mantle vapors took shape clouds 
screen thus formed hand nature heat solar rays tempered nocturnal radiation retarded 
light well heat could modified tempered genialized may use expression air 
produced healthy counterpoise forces atmosphere completely disappeared course exists longer 
besides friend ardan excuse telling something new something surprise surprise dear boy fire away surprising cried ardan 
like dearly surprised 
regret scientists surprised much already shall never good hearty genuine surprise firmly convinced continued captain hardly waiting ardan finish period moon occupancy living creatures days nights means hours long 
well anything could surprise said ardan quickly assertion certainly would 
honorable gentleman base firm conviction know replied captain reason moon present long day night exact equality periods rotation axis revolution around earth 
turned around earth turned around 
consequently back turned sun one half month face half 
believe state things existed period referred 
gentleman believe exclaimed ardan 
chair must excused reminding honorable gentleman accept incredulity sound valid argument 
two movements certainly equal periods always simple reason equality periods due altogether influence terrestrial attraction replied ready captain 
attraction present grant great actually disables moon revolving consequently must always keep face turned towards earth 
assert attraction powerful enough exert influence epoch earth fluid substance fact even assert moon always earth satellite ah indeed exclaimed ardan 
assert moon exist long earth called fact assert earth great piece broken moon nothing like asking absurd questions often found passing best kind arguments friend ardan interposed barbican noticed captain little disconcerted give ready reply friend ardan must say quite wrong showing certain methods reasoning legitimate enough may easily abused carried far 
think however captain might maintain position without recourse speculations altogether gigantic ordinary intellect 
simply admitting insufficiency primordeal attraction preserve perfect balance movements lunar rotation revolution easily see nights days could succeed moon exactly present earth 
nothing clearer resumed brave captain rushing charge 
besides even without alternation days nights life lunar surface quite possible 
course possible said ardan everything possible except contradicts 
possible every possibility fact therefore fact 
however added wishing press captain weak points closely let logical niceties pass present 
established existence humanity moon chair would respectfully ask completely disappeared disappeared completely thousands perhaps millions years ago replied unabashed captain 
perished physical impossibility living longer world atmosphere become degrees rare able perform functions great resuscitating medium dependent existences 
took place moon take place day earth sufficiently cooled 
cooled yes replied captain confidently little hesitation explaining details great machine shop philadelphia see according internal fire near surface extinguished withdrawn towards center lunar shell naturally cooled 
logical consequences course gradually took place extinction organized beings extinction vegetation 
atmosphere meantime became thinner thinner partly drawn water evaporated terrestrial attraction partly sinking solid water crust cracks caused cooling 
disappearance air capable respiration water capable motion moon course became uninhabitable 
day became abode death completely present moment 
fate store earth probability 
befall us soon crust becomes cold enough uninhabitable 
perhaps philosophership taken trouble calculate many years take unfortunate terra mater cool well 
rely figures implicitly 
tell fellow dying impatience know captain chair considers one tantalizing creatures existence listen hear replied nicholl quietly 
careful observations extended series many years men able discover average loss temperature endured earth century 
taking ground work calculations ascertained earth shall become uninhabitable planet cut life short merciful cried ardan pleading tone half earnest 
come good long day honor good long day planet call earth continued captain grave judge become uninhabitable human beings lapse thousand years present time 
hurrah cried ardan much relieved 
vive la science henceforward miscreant persist saying savants good nothing proudly pointing calculation exclaim defamers silence croakers services invaluable insured earth thousand years say vive la science ardan began captain asperity foundations science raised half converted already interrupted ardan cheery tone really believe science altogether unmitigated homebogue vive question discussion interrupted barbican desirous keep friends losing tempers idle disputation 
true said ardan 
chair thankful called order would respectfully remind house question moon inhabited affirmative heard 
negative called reply 
mr barbican parole 
mr barbican unwilling enter deeply exceedingly difficult subject 
probabilities contented saying would appear favor captain speculations 
must never forget speculations nothing 
slightest evidence yet produced moon anything else dead useless waste extinct volcanoes 
signs cities signs buildings even ruins none anything could reasonably ascribed labors intelligent creatures 
sign change kind established 
agreement moon rotation revolution compels keep face constantly turned towards earth know existed beginning 
called effect volcanic agency upon surface know peculiar blistered appearance may brought altogether bubbling spitting blisters molten iron cooling contracting 
close observers even ventured account craters saying due pelting showers meteoric rain 
atmosphere lost atmosphere sink craters atmosphere gas great volume small matter would room solidified intense cold possibly night time 
would heat long day great enough thaw back trouble attends alleged disappearance water 
swallowed cavernous cracks said 
cracks cooling always attended cracking 
water cools without cracking cannon balls cool without cracking 
much stress laid great difference nucleus crust really impossible say one ends begins 
fact theory explains satisfactorily anything regarding present state moon surface 
fact day galileo compared clustering craters eyes peacock tail present time must acknowledge know nothing actually see one particle moon history telescopes reveal corporal eyes lucid opinion honorable learned gentleman spoke last said ardan chair compelled concur 
therefore second question house deliberation moon ever inhabited chair gets difficulty scotch jury evidence enough either way returning solemn verdict proven conclusion said barbican hastily rising subject tell truth unable yet throw light worth speaking let us satisfied present 
another question greater moment us seems increasing distance moon decidedly rapidly 
easy see quite right observation 
projectile still following northerly course therefore approaching lunar equator certainly getting farther farther moon 
even ten degrees farther north latitude tycho travellers considerable difficulty comparatively observing details pitatus walled mountain south shores mare nubium 
sea floated could see little far left th parallel could discern vast crater bullialdus feet deep 
right caught glimpse purbach depressed valley almost square shape round crater center ardan suddenly cried railroad sure enough right little northeast purbach travellers easily distinguished long line straight black really unlike railroad cutting low hilly country 
barbican explained course railway steep cliff least feet high casting deep shadow probably result caving surface eastern edge 
saw immense crater arzachel midst cone mountain shining dazzling splendor 
little north could detect outlines another crater alphonse least miles diameter 
close could easily distinguish immense crater observers call ramparted plain ptolemy well known lunar astronomers occupying favorable position near center moon diameter fully one direction least miles long 
travellers latitude first approached moon began unquestionably leave 
looked looked readjusting glasses details becoming difficult catch 
reliefs grew blurred outlines dimmer dimmer 
even great mountain profiles began fade away dazzling colors grow duller jet black shadows greyer general effect mistier 
last distance become great lunar world wonderful fantastic weird mysterious travellers degrees lost even consciousness sensations lately vivid grew fainter fainter finally resembled man suddenly awakened peculiarly strange impressive dream 
chapter xix 
every fight impossible wins 
matter accustomed sad bid farewell forever 
glimpse moon wondrous world imparted barbican companions like promised land moses mount pisgah distant dark one yet inexpressibly mournful eyes silent thoughtful watched fading away slowly view conviction impressing deeper deeper souls slight acquaintance never renewed 
doubt subject removed position gradually decidedly assumed projectile 
base turning away slowly steadily moon pointing surely unmistakably towards earth 
barbican long carefully noticing modification without able explain 
projectile withdraw long distance moon still satellite could understand satellite present towards heaviest segment moon towards earth point could readily clear 
carefully noting path thought could see projectile though decidedly leaving moon still followed curve exactly analogous approached 
must therefore describing elongated ellipse might possibly extend even neutral point lunar terrestrial attractions mutually overcome 
surmise barbican companions appeared rather disposed agree though course gave rise new questions 
suppose reach dead point asked ardan become us tell barbican unsatisfactory reply 
form hypotheses yes two let us 
velocity either sufficient carry us past dead point sufficient shall keep gravitating forever around moon hypothesis number two least one point favor interrupted usual incorrigible ardan worse hypothesis number one insufficient continued barbican laying law shall rest forever motionless dead point mutually neutralizing attractions 
pleasant prospect observed ardan worst possible better barbican nothing say barbican reply 
nothing say either captain asked ardan beginning little vexed apparent apathy companions 
nothing whatever replied nicholl giving point words despairing shake head 
mean surely going sit like bumps log nothing late attempt anything nothing whatever done said barbican gloomily 
vain struggle impossible 
impossible get word thought american schoolboys cut dictionaries must since time said barbican smiling grimly 
still sticks old copies anyhow drawled nicholl drily carefully wiped glasses 
well business said ardan 
pair live yankees frenchman nineteenth century recoil old fashioned word hardly scared grandfathers correct movement running away us correct certainly correct modify clap brakes take advantage favor matters exact term comprehend easy talking easy business mine kind artillery man master bullets gunner command gun rammed head foremost blown mouth nice pair savants sit helpless couple babies inveigled inveigled cried barbican nicholl starting feet instant come come went ardan giving indignant friends time utter syllable want recrimination one complain even let little consider expression strong even withdraw altogether assert trip delights projectile thing heart never better spirits present moment complain appeal good sense call upon voice everything possible may go somewhere since appears get moon exactly want friend ardan said barbican endeavoring give example calmness impatient nicholl trouble means 
modify projectile movement diminish velocity even lightening heavily laden ship lightened throwing cargo overboard throw overboard ballast like balloon men 
like know interrupted nicholl would good throwing anything overboard 
one particle common sense head see lightened projectile move quicker slower mean said ardan 
quicker mean replied captain 
neither quicker slower dear friends interposed barbican desirous stop quarrel floating know absolute void specific gravity never counts 
well friends said ardan resigned tone evidently endeavored render calm since worst come worst one thing left us said captain getting ready combat new piece nonsense 
take breakfast said frenchman curtly 
resource often fallen back difficult conjunctures 
fail 
though project claimed affect either velocity direction projectile still eminently practicable unattended inconvenience one hand evidently fraught many advantages met decided instantaneous success 
rather early hour breakfast two clock morning yet meal keenly relished 
ardan served charming style crowned dessert bottles wine especially selected occasion private stock 
tokay imperial genuine essenz prince esterhazy wine cellar best brain stimulant brain clearer world every connoisseur knows 
near four clock morning travellers well fortified physically morally resumed observations renewed courage determination system recording really perfect arrangements 
around projectile could still see floating objects dropped window 
convinced revolution around moon passed atmosphere anything kind encountered would revealed presence retarding effect different objects followed close wake projectile 
one two missing probably struck carried fragment exploded bolide 
earth nothing yet could seen 
one day old new previous evening two days still elapse crescent would sufficiently cleared solar rays capable performing ordinary duty serving time piece selenites 
reflecting reader need hardly reminded since rotates perfect regularity axis make rotations visible selenites bringing particular point surface every twenty four hours directly lunar meridian 
towards moon view though far less distinct still almost dazzling ever 
radiant queen night still glittered splendor midst starry host whose pure white light seemed borrow additional purity silvery whiteness gorgeous contrast 
disc seas already beginning assume ashy tint well known us earth rest surface sparkled former radiation tycho glowing like sun midst general resplendescence 
barbican attempted vain obtain even tolerable approximation velocity projectile moving 
content knowledge diminishing uniform rate indeed little reflection well known law dynamics readily convinced 
much difficulty even explaining matter friends 
admitting said projectile describe orbit round moon orbit must necessity ellipse 
every moving body circulating regularly around another describes ellipse 
science proved incontestably 
satellites describe ellipses around planets planets around sun sun describes ellipse around unknown star serves pivot whole solar system 
baltimore gun club projectile escape universal law consequence law orbit circle satellite would always preserve distance primary velocity therefore constant 
orbit ellipse attracting body always occupying one foci satellite must evidently lie nearer focus one part orbit another 
earth nearest sun perihelion distant aphelion 
moon regard earth similarly perigee apogee 
analogous expressions denoting relations projectile towards moon would periselene aposelene 
aposelene projectile velocity would reached minimum periselene maximum 
former point moving clearly velocity must keep diminishing point reached 
die altogether must spring even accelerate reapproaches moon 
great trouble aposelenetic point coincide point lunar attraction velocity must certainly become nil projectile must remain relatively motionless forever mean relatively motionless asked nicholl carefully studying situation 
mean course absolutely motionless answered barbican absolute immobility well aware altogether impossible motionless regard earth mahomet jackass interrupted ardan hastily must say precious set imb ciles deny dear friend said barbican quietly notwithstanding unceremonious interruption say though possessed power retarding velocity takes us moon never thought employing mean forget rockets fact cried nicholl 
forgotten sure tell answered barbican unless perhaps many things think 
thought dear friend happy one course shall utilize 
soon first favorable opportunity sooner 
see dear friends went explaining present obliquity projectile regard lunar disc discharge rockets would likely send us away moon towards 
course still desirous reaching moon emphatically reserving rockets last chance may possibly get 
consequence force utterly inexplicable projectile still seems disposed turn base towards earth 
fact likely enough neutral point cone point vertically moon 
moment velocity probably nil also moment us discharge rockets possibility may force direct fall lunar disc 
good cried ardan clapping hands 
execute grand maneuver first time reached neutral point asked nicholl little crustily 
would useless answered barbican projectile velocity time doubt remember need rockets actually great affected 
true chimed ardan wind four miles hour little use steamer going ten 
assertion cried nicholl rather dis dear friends interposed barbican pale face beaming clear voice ringing new excitement let us waste time mere words 
one chance perhaps great one 
let us throw away brink despair beyond cried ardan 
begin see possibility nay decided probability able attain great end last bravo cried ardan 
hurrah cried nicholl 
yes brave boys cried barbican enthusiastically companions yet long shot brought great revulsion spirits bold adventurers breakfast prince esterhazy tokay latter probably 
become resolutions discussed ably passed decidedly hours moon inhabited moon habitable yet face rather coolly subjects never alluded reckless scientists actually thinking nothing work heaven earth order get one question remained answered played last trump namely precise moment would projectile reach neutral point barbican little trouble finding answer 
time spent proceeding south pole dead point evidently equal time previously spent proceeding dead point north pole ascertain former calculate latter 
easily done 
refer notes check different rates velocity readied different parallels turn rates time required minutes careful calculation 
projectile reach point neutral attraction one clock morning december th 
present time five clock morning th therefore nothing unforeseen occur meantime great final effort made twenty hours later 
rockets often alluded idea ardan already fully described originally provided break violence projectile fall lunar surface dauntless travellers employ purpose precisely reverse 
case put proper order immediate use nothing remained done till moment come firing 
friends said nicholl rubbing eyes hardly able keep open fond talking time think may offer slight proposition 
shall happy entertain dear captain said barbican 
illustration ardan gazed pair 
propose lie take good nap 
good gracious protested ardan next blessed wink forty hours continued captain little sleep would recuperate us wonderfully 
sleep exclaimed ardan 
every man taste said nicholl mine present certainly turn suiting action word coiled sofa minutes deep regular breathing showed slumber tranquil infant barbican looked kindly way short time eyes grew filmy could keep open longer 
captain said may without little faults good practical sense worth ship load like ardan 
jove going imitate friend michael might worse short time unconscious captain 
ardan gazed pair minutes began feel quite lonely 
even animals fast asleep 
tried look observing without anybody listen observations dull work 
looked sleeping pair gave 
denied muttered slowly nodding head even practical men sometimes stumble good idea 
curling long legs folding arms head restless brain soon forming fantastic shapes mysterious land dreams 
slumbers much disturbed last long 
uneasy restless unrefreshing attempt repose sat half past seven clock began stretching found companions already awake discussing situation whispers 
projectile remarking still pursuing way moon turning conical point direction 
latter phenomenon though puzzling ever barbican regarded decided pleasure directly conical summit pointed moon exact moment directly towards surface would rockets communicate reactionary motion 
nearly seventeen hours however still elapse moment important moment would arrive 
time began drag 
excitement produced moon vicinity died 
travellers though daring confident ever could help feeling certain sinking heart approach moment deciding either alternative doom world fall moon eternal imprisonment changeless orbit 
barbican nicholl tried kill time revising calculations putting notes order ardan feverishly walking back forth window window stopping second two throw nervous glance cold silent impassive moon 
reminiscences lower world would flit across brains 
visions famous gun club rose oftenest dear friend marston always central figure 
bustling honest good natured impetuous heart probably standing bravely post rocky mountains eye glued great telescope whole soul peering tube 
seen projectile vanished behind moon north pole could caught glimpse reappearance could concluded satellite satellite could belfast announced world startling piece intelligence earth ever know great enterprise speculations scientific world upon subject etc etc 
listless questions desultory conversation kind day slowly wore away without occurrence incident whatever relieve weary monotony 
midnight arrived december seventh dead 
ardan said le sept decembre est mort vive le huit one hour neutral point would reached 
velocity projectile moving barbican could exactly tell felt quite certain serious error slipped calculations 
one clock night nil velocity nil would another phenomenon case mark arrival exact moment 
dead point two attractions terrestrial lunar would exactly counterbalance 
seconds objects would longer possess slightest weight 
curious circumstance much surprised amused travellers first occurrence appear soon conditions become identical 
seconds would come moment striking decisive blow 
could soon notice gradual approach important instant 
objects began weigh sensibly lighter 
conical point projectile become almost directly center lunar surface 
gladdened hearts bold adventurers 
recoil rockets losing none power oblique action chances pronounced decidedly favor 
supposing projectile velocity absolutely annihilated dead point slightest force directing towards moon would certain cause finally fall surface 
supposing supposing contrary even brave adventurers courage suppose contrary five minutes one clock said nicholl eyes never quitting watch 
ready asked barbican ardan 
ay ay sir ardan reply made sure electric apparatus discharge rockets perfect working order 
wait till give word said barbican pulling chronometer 
moment evidently close hand 
objects lying around weight 
travellers felt bodies buoyant hydrogen balloon 
barbican let go chronometer kept place firmly empty space eyes nailed wall one clock cried barbican solemn tone 
ardan instantly touched discharging key little electric battery 
dull dead distant report immediately heard communicated probably vibration projectile internal air 
ardan saw window long thin flash vanished second 
moment three friends became instantaneously conscious slight shock experienced projectile 
looked speechless breathless long would take count five silence intense could easily hear pulsation hearts 
ardan first break

unanimous opinion council officers hastily summoned together captain go work fish projectile least possible delay 
operation possible asked doubter 
yes overwhelming reply difficult doubt still quite possible 
certainly however attempt immediately possible susquehanna machinery strong enough suitable enough piece work involving nicety detailed operations speak exceeding difficulty 
next unanimous decision therefore start vessel nearest port whence could instantly telegraph projectile arrival baltimore gun club 
nearest port serious question answer satisfactory manner captain carefully examine sailing charts 
neighboring shores california peninsula low sandy absolutely destitute good harbors 
san diego day sail directly north possessed excellent harbor yet telegraphic communication rest union course thought 
san pedro bay open approached winter 
santa barbara channel liable objection mention trouble often caused kelp wintry fogs 
bay san luis obispo still worse every respect islands act breakwater landing winter often impossible 
harbor picturesque old town monterey safe enough uncertainty regarding sure telegraphic communications san francisco decided council venture 
half moon bay little north would risky moments like present every minute worth day risk involving slightest loss time could ventured 
evidently therefore advisable plan sail directly bay san francisco golden gate finest harbor pacific coast one safest world 
telegraphic communication parts union assured beyond doubt 
san francisco miles distant susquehanna could probably make three days little increased pressure possibly two days half 
sooner started better 
fires soon full blast 
vessel could get weigh 
fact nothing delayed immediate departure consideration two miles sounding line still hauled ocean depths 
rut captain moment thought unwilling time lost determined cut 
marking position fastening end buoy could haul leisure return 
besides said buoy show us precise spot projectile fell 
captain observed brownson exact spot carefully recorded already north latitude west longitude reckoning meridian washington 
right lieutenant said captain curtly 
cut line large cone shaped metal buoy strengthened still couple stout spars securely lashed soon rigged deck whence hoisted overboard whole apparatus carefully lowered surface sea
