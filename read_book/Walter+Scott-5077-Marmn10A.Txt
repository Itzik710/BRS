fifteen years written scott began composition marmion interesting note early life date letter indicates keenly alive great blunder military tactics made james iv advisers manifestly stirred eloquent expression feeling 
november scott began marmion designed romance feudalism succeed border study lay last minstrel 
circumstances time doubt extent prompted choice subject 
napoleon diligently working ambitious scheme western empire plotting ruin great britain indispensable feature arrangement 
scott always intimately acquainted details current politics subject fairly roused interest slow take part discussion 
notably illustrated year outspoken energetic political ballad produced acquittal lord melville serious charge 
ballad went straight heart subject left doubt party feeling writer arrested general attention gave considerable offence leaders side sharply handled 
given explanation circumstances called forth lockhart life ii 
ed 
however party politics always subject interested scott patriotism constituent element character 
keen sense national dignity honor extract flodden letter alone sufficiently testifies circumstances demanded would almost certainly distinguished trooper field battle 
thus love picturesque theme inspired tale flodden field likewise patriotic ardor desire touch national heart 
marmion epical character movement time brilliant suggestive delineation national effort illustrating keen sense honor resolute purpose pathetic manly devotion 
james iv probably wrong certainly rash attempting battle henry viii although people aware mistake advisers power dissuade supported last heroism recalls thermopylae 
display national character appealed directly powerfully scott prompting production loftiest energetic verse 
mournful associations ever cluster around tragic battle flodden dolent day lyndsay aptly calls record remains heroic men king country groom fought like noble squire like knight fearlessly well 
scott intended work slowly carefully new poem explains introduction circumstances interrupted design 
particular passages says poem finally called marmion labored good deal care one much care seldom bestowed 
publication however hastened misfortunes near relation friend

characteristics poem 
marmion avowedly descriptive poem 
series skilful impressive pictures remarkable conspicuous kind poetical literature 
scott said deficient rate imperfectly trained certain sense activities denying quick perception color strong sense leading points landscape 
even minute features seized utilized ease precision larger elements scene depicted breadth sense proportion clearness impressiveness arrangement 
holds true whether description merely vivid presentment imagination poet calls remote past delineation actually come notice 
norham twilight solitary warder battlements crichtoun castle scott saw instantly commend realistic vigor consistent verisimilitude 
visitor norham still able imagine stir imposing spectacle described opening stanzas first canto pleasure follow scott minute faithful picture crichtoun examining imposing ruin stands present day 
impossible feel edinburgh sixteenth century exactly depicted poem troops borough moor disposed seen trained military eye sir walter scott 
would difficult find anywhere striking ancient stronghold tantallon would easy conceive appropriate scene grim exciting morning interview venerable douglas found harboured recreant knight 
great battle scene standing alone literature carefully detailed delineation persistent minuteness rapidity movement balanced effects energetic purpose surpassing everything modern verse vivid homeric realism 
fifteen years seen scott progress battle mind eye length produced description present character skilful interested spectator 
envious people decline admit scott discovered scenery contend others knew appreciated way 
yet fact remains scott likewise saw appreciated way peculiar thereby enabled numerous readers share enjoyment 
interesting suggestive account new popularity given flodden district publication marmion found lockhart life iii 

autumn scott visited rokeby journey horseback along eldest boy girl ponies 
following episode way halting flodden expound field battle young folks found marmion might expected benefited keeper public house largely village boniface overflowing gratitude expressed anxiety scott head sign post 
poet demurred proposal assured mine host nothing could appropriate portraiture foaming tankard already surmounted doorway 
painter man made ill job said landlord would fain something connected book brought much good custom

scott opened book death scene hero eye immediately caught inscription black letter drink weary pilgrim drink pray kind soul sibyl grey c well friend said would need strike one letter first lines make painter man next time comes way print jolly tankard name drink weary pilgrim drink pay 
scott delighted find return suggestion adopted aught know romantic legend may still visible 
characters poem hardly less vigorous conception presentation descriptions 
may true carlyle asserts ungenerous essay scott inferior shakespeare delineation character even admitting shall still ample room approval admiration work 
far purposes poem concerned various personages admirably utilized 
come know marmion intimately interest gradually deepening real character palmer relations hero steadily developed 
two take prominent rank imaginary characters literature 
james iv champion dames likewise undoubted military leader faithfully delineated accordance historical records contemporary estimates 
desirous seeing struck imagination poet day read eulogy passed upon barclay ship fools 
passage occurs interpolation division poem entitled ruine decay holy faith catholique 
characters distinctly suited parts perform 
acting licence sanctioned horatian authority atque ita mentitur sic veris falsa remiscet primo ne medium medio ne discrepet imum scott appropriates sir david lyndsay purpose presenting even presents stately venerable angus faithful striking picturesqueness 
bishop douglas exactly suited share development events room likewise found court poet dunbar author james epithalamium thrissill rois would fit seemly arrangement 
scott remembered dunbar favorite queen margaret might introduced interesting episode 
passage devoted queen exquisite graceful restrained effective pathos making singularly direct significant appeal 
female characters well conceived sustained constance trial scene reaches imposing height dramatic intensity 
descriptions characterisation remaining important features poem marked practical irony episodes 
marmion despite many excellences throughout obvious reasons victim persistent nemesis 
scott much interested hero one fancies possible would end extend favor grant absolution sense artistic fitness prevails abate jot painful ordeal feels bound submit 
marmion knight claim nothing half proverbial qualifications 
sans peur sans reproche one expression practical irony constantly lurks assail even fearlessness quails time phantom knight gifford moor 
whole attitude palmer ironical bitter parting angus tantallon marmion weighted depressing reflection numerous forces conspiring knowledge old rival de wilton thrown palmer disguise preceded scene war 
last hour practical irony position bears upon concentration keen bitter thrusts 
clare intended defraud ministers last needs learns constance died bitter death lindisfarne recognizes greatest need strength life speedily ebbs away 
certain grandeur impressive tragical effort last struggles feels whatever may suffers end merciless machinery false ecclesiastical system 
practical irony follows even death skilful stroke leaves neglected remains field battle places nameless stranger stately tomb 
regards episodes may said word appropriate instead retarding movement piece sometimes alleged serve give breadth massiveness effect 
course always found think long whose narrowness view constrains wish introductions away 
poet conception marmion fully considered seen host tale integral part purpose surely need defend either sir david lyndsay tale weird display cross edinburgh 
episode lady heron singing carries defense seeing song lochinvar holds place distinction among lyrics expressive poetical motion

criticisms poem 
marmion little begun scott publishers offered thousand pounds copyright soon became known naturally gave rise varied comment 
lord byron thought sufficient warrant gratuitous attack author english bards scotch reviewers 
portion passage think st thou scott vain conceit perchance public taste foist thy stale romance 
though murray miller may combine yield thy muse half crown per line sons song descend trade bays sear former laurels fade 
matter fact scott part trade whatever case 
publisher chose secure advance anticipated would profitable commodity mainly publisher affair poet would simpleton close offer liked 
scott admirably disposes byron follows introduction publishers lay last minstrel emboldened success poem willingly offered thousand pounds marmion 
transaction secret afforded lord byron general war blacked paper apology including satire entitled english bards scotch reviewers 
never could conceive arrangement author publishers satisfactory persons concerned could afford matter censure third party 
taken unusual ungenerous means enhancing value merchandise never higgled moment bargain accepted considered handsome offer publishers 
gentlemen least opinion taken advantage transaction indeed one framing contrary sale poem far beyond expectation induce supply author cellars always acceptable present young scottish housekeeper namely hogshead excellent claret 
second point scott attacked character marmion 
held knight undoubtedly incapable forgery 
scott course knew better critics whether case usual good nature generous regard opinion others admitted perhaps committed artistic blunder 
dr leyden particular whose judgment special respect wrote india furious remonstrance subject 
fortunately made attempt change written main reason corrections however judicious bad effect publication 
might added modification hero guilt would entirely altered character poem might ruined altogether 
never apparently gone question thoroughly first impressions type knights existing feudal times though states similar instances found might quoted inclined admit attribution forgery gross defect 
readers interested subject find reference pike history crime scott perfectly justified assumption feudal knight capable forgery 
understand intimate knowledge period dealing course readiest believe rather critics seems doubtful ready yield point well strength original position thus supported results recent investigation 
jeffrey edinburgh review able understand appreciate new devotion romance probably stimulated misreading reference fox introduction canto utmost cast discredit marmion 
scott large man confound separate spheres politics literature whereas frequently case jeffrey indeed extent literary critics side well estimate author work reference party state known belong 
impossible deny merits scott descriptions extraordinary energy striking portions poem jeffrey groaned inequalities professed discover lamented poet waste strength unprofitable effort resuscitate old fashioned enthusiasm 
best friends previously scott seen worked edinburgh review patent old literary intimacy could pleasantly continue 
surprising scott felt edinburgh review become autocratic given helping hand towards establishing quarterly review political literary organ necessary balance parties
