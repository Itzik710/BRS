pagans could invest gods iota grandeur

object show ancients even greeks could support idea immortality 
idea crumbled pieces touch

doubtless insolent grecian philosopher would say surely knew immortality meant liberated mortality 
yes negative idea demand give affirmative idea 
perhaps shall better explain meaning substituting terms illustration value 
say greek idea immortality involves nominal idea real idea 
nominal idea thing nominal definition simply sketches outline object shape problem whereas real definition fills outline solves problem 
nominal definition states conditions object would realized mind real definition executes conditions 
nominal definition may express briefly pointedly puts question real definition answers question 
thus give illustration insoluble problem squaring circle presents us good nominal idea

pagan sacrifices 
ask well informed man random supposes done sacrifices answer really never thought naturally supposes flesh burnt upon altars 
reader sacrifice gods meant universally banquet man 
gave splendid public dinner announced words designed celebrate sacrificial rite 
course 
hand announced sacrificial pomp words proclaim sound trumpet gave dinner 
necessity 
hence agamemnon offers hecatomb jupiter brother menelaus walks dinner greek hachl tost without invitation 
brother told homer invitation required 
privilege german beautifully called ein kind des hauses child house 
dispensation necessity formal invitation homer explains explanation knew dinner passes superfluous 
vast herd oxen could sacrificed without open public display preparation human banquet must accompany divine sacrifice much self evident truth homer trouble make needless explanation 
hence therefore case legislation st paul christian administration venture say readers understand 
take feast ephesus 
cities asia minor greece jews lived great numbers 
universal hospitality regions exhibited dinners greek dehipna 
happened sometimes always gave dinner day made sacrifice great temple nay dinner always part sacrifice thus following dilemma arose 
scruples eating part sacrifices absolutely unintelligible except insults ephesus 
deny existence diana meaning ears ephesian 
understand happened hater ephesus must hate guardian deity ephesus 
sole inference could collect refusing eat hallowed diana hated ephesus 
dilemma therefore either grant toleration practice else farewell amicable intercourse jews citizens 
fact proclaim open war concession refused 
scruple conscience might allowed scruple nature could find allowance pagan city whatever 
moreover really foundation 
truth far otherwise pagan deities dreams 
far 
real beings 
accommodation therefore st paul wisely granted eat socially without regard ceremony food might passed 
long judaizing christian party religious ceremonies free participation idolatry 
since mere open operation pagan process could transform character accomplice one assenting heart ate food case christ might possibility shared idolatrous banquet christians day east indies might months together become unconscious accomplices foul idolatries buddhist brahminical superstitions 
essentially convivial banquets pagans interwoven religious rites essentially great dinner great offering gods vice vers great offering gods great dinner ministers chief agents religion first

david numbering people politics situation 
read hebrew scriptures man thirty sons rode white asses riding white asses circumstance expresses high rank distinction princes 
syria greece almost everywhere white regal symbolic color 
mode equitation far inferior wealth ancient times implied wealth 
mules asses besides far superior race syria less persia furnish favorite designation warlike hero could much conveniently used wretched roads yet found everywhere romans began treat road making regular business military pioneering 
case therefore thirty sons one man provided princely establishments 
consequently thirty sons somewhat surprising possible land polygamy keep none back obscurity done cases funds family would allow giving separate establishment argued condition unusual opulence 
surprising true 
therefore involving argument truth writer would justly deny pleading reason surprising tell story 
train years naturally must happen many wonderful things events persons 
crowded together time locally indeed incredulously reject 
understand vast remoteness time place freely admit tendency lies way wonder would many coincidences separately might looked upon strange 
surgeon set collect certain cases reason unaccountably fatal purpose therefore including terminate fatally remember generally historians although less jewish historian far nobler chain wonders record feel open objection romancing report something ordinary track since exactly sort matter object found considerable proportion course travels vast range successive generations 
would marvellous thing indeed every one five hundred men author chosen record biographically baptismal name francis 
found reason admitting man series however strange reason fact governed selecting subjects would longer see anything startle belief 
let give interesting case partly illustrating principle 
present occasion two young men one young clever suggesting infidel scruples much older entering professional career considerable distinction point drinking companion urged much weighty objection could answered 
younger man fact boy used passage bible one circumstances jewish army consisted men 
said knowing enormity force peace establishment even mighty empires like england perfectly like fairy tale arabian nights entertainment sound hear monstrous armaments little country like jud equal perhaps twelve counties wales addressed could see whole expression young physician condition exactly studies purely professional made king happened hurt leg wore white fasci thigh 
knew little nothing scriptural records read upon subject quite little thought unfortunately conversation lain amongst clever chemists naturalists prejudgment case ability free power mind ran channel scepticism people situated women acquiesce faith politics fathers predecessors could believe much scriptures except slow examine multitudes pretended believe upon interested motive 
precisely situation young physician listened manifest interest checked going speak knew danger reputed infidel temper martyrdom whole gesture manner tendency showed passing mind 
yes x right manifestly right every rational view modern standard good sense reflective political economy tends conclusion 
reflex light political economy know even hour much condition ancient lands like palestine athens etc quite unrevealed wisest men amongst 
entering critical walk social life shall need every aid advantageous impression favor religious belief prudence speak shall speak warmly forbear 
replied instance usefully replied sufficed check one gravitating downwards infidelity likely settle ever reached point substance firstly plea regard numbers extraordinary far affecting credibility statement disadvantageously ground agreeably logic scantily expounded feature case partly engaged notice scriptural writer 
great army little nation 
therefore would writer say therefore print record 
secondly must however misled narrow limits welsh limits suppose welsh population 
whilst twelve counties wales yield half million people palestine pretty certainly number fluctuating four six millions 
thirdly great consideration stage expansion society hebrew nation stood sublime interest sublime enough though far comprehending solemn freight hopes confided consciously defended 
age pay given soldier 
soldier constitutes separate profession regular pay undertakes regular danger hardships 
motive giving pay rations precisely undertake 
pay allowed common fund never endured justice whole society individual member individual one insulated stake holder greater interest embarked others undertake danger labor warfare whole 
two inferences arise upon armies immense first militia properly even landwehr posse comitatus whole martial strength people one four drawn slightly trained meet danger times always passing cloud 
regular successive campaigns unknown enemy whoever might could little support regular army people palestine 
consequently enemies would disperse hastily reaping mowing may observe jews joshua 
required therefore long absence home 
march waiting opportunity watching favourable day sunshine cloud rising subsiding river wind enemy face ambush skilfully posted 
ready signal given great battle ensued sunset one anxious day one way another 
upon position circumstances neither fair dispensation personal service except citizens scruples interfered motive wishing 
contrary days service stigma individual house kin would evaded ages treacherously forsaken commonwealth agony 
preference fighting station would eager instead backward 
would become often requisite evident jews reality make successive sifting winnowing service troops every stage throwing upon severer principles examination seemed least able face trying crisis whilst honorable posts great dependency would assigned rejected modes soothing offended pride 
case great danger case ordinary danger doubt many vicarious arrangements would exist way evading injurious movement whole fighting population 
either ordinary watch ward section happened locally threatened instance invasion one side edom moab another side canaanites philistines would undertake case one fallen allotment providence section whose service happened due month without local regards would face exigency 
great national danger stage society jews reached moses david stage fighting separate professional duty stage things announced military pay army large men army small requires explained 
secondly inference phenomenon military pay therefore separate fighting profession foreign war war aggression war booty war martial glory quite unknown 
rules political economy applied maintenance armies must course contemplate regular trade war pursued objects domestic war beating attack upon hearths altars 
war observed could lawfully entertained jewish people 
mahomet stole great ideas mosaic christian revelations found inevitable add one principle unknown either religious motive perpetual war aggression principle discovered imaginary duty summary proselytism 
instruction required 
sufficient convert without sincerity terror sword throat spoke words aloud disowned faith allah mahomet prophet 
sufficient soldier heard nation denying ignoring mahomet justify atrocity invasive warfare 
jews commission proselyte needed evidences assent simply bawl short formula words refused become proselyte object persecution 
nations forced languages upon others badges servitude 
romans far treating language way compelled barbarous nations frontier pay license use latin tongue 
much reason jews instead wishing obtrude sublime religion upon foreigners expect valued manifest value coming jerusalem seeking instruction doctors law worshipping outer court temple 
prodigious state separation mahometan principle fanatical proselytism jews placed first 
one small district cleared ancient idolatrous probably desperately demoralized tribes 
even purification intended instant upon following reason partly unveiled god partly left integration viz case sudden desolation wild beasts noxious serpents would encroached much human population 
much expressed probably sequel foreseen jews would lapsed wild hunting race outworn ceremonial propensity fitted civil life formed hive great work god shiloh probationary temple glorious temple service jerusalem operated mysterious instinct queen bee compress organize whole society cohesion like life 
perhaps lay reason allowing sudden summary extirpation even idolatrous tribes whilst upon second principle never meant extirpation complete 
snares temptations thickly sown case restless jew would severely tried neither utterly withdrawn case faith would undergo probation 
even upon small domestic scale therefore appears aggressive warfare limited interest time 
first complete second even incompleteness concentrated within short time 
narrow gradual 
necessity therefore original appointment part national economy small system aggressive warfare could provide reason military profession 
wars aggression wars operating upon foreign objects allowance motive colourable plea attacks upon edom midian moab mere acts retaliation strictly speaking aggressive parts defensive warfare 
consequently remained permanent case war divine allowance could ever justify establishment military caste civil wars jews either grew one intolerable crime taken adopted wickedly defended whole tribe case horrible atrocity committed benjamites adopted whole tribe case bloody exterminating war god sanction succeeded rapidly drew close else grew ruinous schism ten tribes two seated jerusalem 
schism countenance god still less could wars followed 
belligerent state remains could contemplated provided original mosaic theory constitution clearly none except one sole case foreign invasion 
national strength struck existence people holy citadel shiloh jerusalem called whole military strength last man hebrew people 
consequently case armies could tend great numerical amount must tend excessive amount 
far difficult problem solve men true difficulty would lie way account much reduced 
seems highly probable offence david numbering people ultimately occasion fixing site temple jerusalem pointed remarkable military position jewish people position forbidding fixed military institutions yet david probably contemplating census 
simply number people could crime could desideratum david often told muster rolls whole nation particular tribe feel room doubt reports point constantly corrected brought review governing elders councils judges princes king according historical circumstances need criminality census would vanish moment 
census ordered david 
wanted specific return probably particular wealth nature employment pursued individual family upon return might ground permanent military organization people organization would thoroughly revolutionized character population well drawn foreign wars alliances 
painful think many amiable really candid minds search truth laid hold plausible argument case young physician topic political economy local examination argument would altogether change bearing 
argument popularly enforced seemed imply impossibility supporting large force public funds ran towards support levites majestic service altar 
confusion arises double sense word army machine ordinarily disposable foreign objects indifferently one jud exclusively could applied service must nature sudden brief always tending decisive catastrophe 
true form crime circumstances lead suspect especially remarkable demur joab respectful remonstrance said effect whole strength nation known sum meaning ordinary state returns need search inquisitively special details ready fight cheerfully seek separate minuti particular class general returns regard ordinary causa belli hostile invasion 
nations alike rude refined gone upon general outline computation subtracting females males gross general way would always bisect total return population 
make second bisection male half would subtract one quarter entire people young old otherwise infirm warlike labors leaving precisely one quarter nation every fourth head available war 
process david case would yielded perhaps fighting men throughout palestine 
unwieldy pospolite far meeting david secret anxieties 
remarked fickle insurrectionary state people 
even easy found organize sudden rebellion conceal prosperously whole court saved capture hours start enemy enemy want cavalry 
danger meantime vanished might possible david personally great conspiracy disturb seat upon throne 
none david sons approached absalom popularity yet subsequent attempt adonijah showed revolutionary temper still awake quarter 
david feared looking spirit tenure immediate descendants would maintain title 
danger want principle regulating succession want operating state things far less determined amongst monogamous nations one son pleading priority birth another perhaps mother higher rank third pleading juniority inasmuch brought within description porphyrogeniture royal birth often felt transcendent primogeniture even people apart several pretenders throne would create separate interests grounds insurrection intestine feuds 
seems good reason think already ten tribes israel opposed judah looked upon favored royal tribe judah supplementary section benjamin unduly favored national economy 
secretly little doubt murmured even god ranking powerful tribe prerogative tribe 
jealousy evidently risen great height suppressed vigilant strong government solomon outset son reign exploded scriptural account case shows proceeded upon old grievances 
boyish rashness rehoboam might exasperate leaders precipitate issue clearly prepared revolt 
would remark young men rehoboam undoubtedly meant soldiers body guards jewish kings retained element royal pomp 
invariable use term east 
even josephus term military profession generally young men whilst elders mean councilors state 
david saw enough popular spirit satisfied political reliance permanence dynasty even home internal source weakness 
tribe benjamin mortified incensed deposition saul family bloody proscription family adopted david 
one grandson saul spared love friend jonathan 
mephibo sheth incapacitated throne lameness 
deep resentment amongst benjamites evident insulting advantage taken despondency day distress shimei 
shimei motive act coming roadside cursing king beyond attachment house saul 
humanly speaking david prospect propagating dynasty small 
hand god promised support 
hence crime arose viz upon infidelity seeking secure throne mere human arrangement first place secondly arrangement must disorganize existing theocratic system jewish people 
upon crime followed chastisement sudden pestilence 
remarkable significant manner god manifested nature trespass particular course meant originally still mean counteract worst issue david apprehensions 
happened angel pestilence halted threshing floor araunah precisely spot god dreams david indicate site glorious temple 
thus seemed though many words god declared crime punishment understand fears vain 
continue throne house longer anxieties personally pursue descent 
regard terrors israel although event great schism inevitable essential councils yet allow operate extinction house 
temple place angel commissioned pause shall one great means one great pledge decree favor posterity

exquisite dispersion ethnographic political half scriptural malediction boulanger answer attempts meet half byword astonishment etc entirely blinked

dr johnson partially examined lives must far qualified justice 
justice done chiefly repeat day owing false impressions pope selfish ungenial misanthropic nature humiliating associations connected pope petty manoeuvring trivial domestic affairs chiefly dr johnson means never obliterated

rome recruits england recruits 
two facts sound estimate roman corn trade depends first important one rome sense italian peninsula relied upon foreign corn narrowest sense rome city respected call lombardy florence genoa etc rome disturb ancient agriculture 
fact offers perhaps still important consideration 
rome latterly populous city disposed agree lipsius four times populous moderns esteem certainly bore higher ratio total italy capital even london since borne territory presided 
consequently argued ratio must foreign importations rome even limited sense rome city operated destructively upon domestic agriculture 
grant italy rome main importer foreign grain still rome italy one four population good reason believe even upon distinction insisted roman importation crushed one fourth native agriculture 
deny 
part african egyptian grain substitution sardinian far made difference italy ploughs denarii 
main consideration italian grain withdrawn vast population rome logic case contrary vast population rome arose supervened consequence upon opening foreign alexandrian corn trade 
rome quirted home agriculture 
rome full sense never would existed without foreign supplies 
therefore rome means foreign grain rose four hundred thousand heads four millions follows except original demand four hundred thousand one plough disused italy ever used 
whilst even regard original demand four hundred thousand much egyptian grain mere substitution sardinian effect whatever could followed italian agriculture 
therefore see many limitations arise modern doctrine upon destructive agricultural consequences roman corn trade 
rome may prevented italian agriculture expanding could caused decline 
let us see far roman corn trade affected roman recruiting service 
alleged agriculture declined foreign corn trade reason ploughmen declined 
shown cause doubting whether agriculture declined increase liberty infer ploughmen decline increase 
even real imaginary ploughmen time possessed italy many south slaves therefore ineligible legionary service except desperate intestine struggles like social war servile 
rome could lose recruiting service ploughmen really possessed really possessed slaves slaves might used soldiers could said liable absolute loss except ordinarily use soldiers preferred use circumstances free choice 
points premised go say craze current amongst learned men deeply disturbed truth history notion marsi peligni big boned italian rustics ever choice constituted general even favorite recruiting fund roman republic 
thousands books seen asserted assumed romans triumphed extensively chiefly armies composed roman kindred blood 
false 
material military system romans true key astonishing successes 
time hannibal roman consul relied chiefly true upon italian recruits could seldom look men blood 
possible enough man fabius marcellus sent abroad proconsul might find choice even formerly necessity 
respects probable italian rustic true italian blood period best raw material easily procured legionary soldier 
circumstances altered range war expanded east became far costly recruit italy less costly could italy supplied waste 
advantages roman military system particular physical material required making good soldiers 
reasons levant permanently occupied romans legion originally stationed continued stationed recruited unless rare emergency critical war arising distance continually recruited lapse generation contained hardly roman italian blood composition like attic ship repaired cedar retained fragment original oak 
thus legion stationed antioch became entirely syrian stationed alexandria grecian jewish separate sense alexandrine 
c sar notorious raised one entire legion gauls distinguished cognizance upon helmet lark whence commonly called legion alauda 
recruited legions gaul 
spain armies assanius petreius surrendered c sar convention consisted chiefly spaniards hispanienses romans born spain hispani spaniards blood pharsalia large part c sar army gauls pompey well known many even amongst legions contained europeans c sar seasonably reminded army consisted vagabonds every part east

fact need system discipline would made good soldiers mop handles like lucian magical mop handles could learned march fill buckets water word command 
see secret power also secret political wisdom christianity another instance 
public largesses grain old rome commenced upon principles ambition factious encouragement partisans new rome constantinople propagated ages novel motive christian charity paupers 
practice condemned whole chorus historians fancy cause domestic agriculture languished bounty given upon pauperism 
reveries literary men 
particular section rural industry languished italy reaction rent severe modern sense 
grain imported sardinia africa province egypt grown upon soils less costly equal cost productive 
effect upon italy bringing back considerable portion provincial corn growth domestic districts would suddenly develop rent upon large series evils load provincial grain well home grown cheap provincial well dear home grown whole difference new costs 
neither policy case analogous moment 
three circumstances differs essentially first provinces foreigners colonies enemies 
exotic corn trade could rome two great injuries assuredly would england could transfer machinery opulence hostile rival state could invest jealous competitor power suddenly cut supplies grown necessity thus create one month famine insurrection 
egypt neither power prospect power act independent state towards rome transfer egypt roman agriculture supposing greater really could operated like transfer norfolk yorkshire 
secondly respected italy foreign grain enter markets native 
either one would lost advantage natural bounty enjoyed circumstances 
consequently evils artificial scale grain raised one set circumstances fixes modifies price grain raised different set circumstances unknown italian markets 
evils special machinery viz machinery good bad seasons aggravated modern state intensely whenever depends much upon alien stores specifically aggravated fact grains enter market one high price encouraged unreasonably price low opposite circumstances depressed ruinously regards coming years whence end two sets disturbances one set frequently present seasons second set way made act upon future markets 
thirdly roman corn trade necessity affect military service injuriously reason rural economy necessity languish agriculture languished locally culture vineyards oliveta orchards pastures replaced declining culture grain ploughmen fewer labourers 
forgotten besides decline italian agriculture never local exceedingly gradual two hundred fifty years christian era italy never depended exclusively upon 
sardinia sicily doors granaries consequently change never abrupt change modern writers imagine 
let us indulge luxury confirming said light contrast 
suppose circumstances changed suppose reversed evil consequence sought take effect case rome denied
