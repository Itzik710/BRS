higher sympathies apart jarl wonderful liking loved first cleaved 
sometimes case old mariner like conceive strong attachment young sailor shipmate attachment devoted wholly inexplicable unless originating heart loneliness overtakes seamen grow aged impelling fasten upon chance object regard 
however viking thy unbidden affection noblest homage ever paid

viking thought cast comrade viking alone 
chapter iv chat clouds skyeman seemed earnest upright seaman tell plain truth spite love many misgivings readiness unite undertaking apparently savored moral dereliction 
things considered deemed resolution quite venial inducing another join seemed precaution indispensable outweigh considerations 
therefore resolved freely open heart special purpose paying visit like old albatross air happened perched foremast head lookout whales never seen 
standing upon bit stick feet aloft hours time swiftly sailing sea much like crossing channel balloon 
manfred like talk clouds fellow feeling sun 
jarl got conversing smoking dwarfish dudeens sea gull passing might taken us messrs blanchard jeffries socially puffing dinner bagdads bound calais via heaven dover 
honest jarl acquainted conversation captain hint implied last words firm resolve quit ship one boats facility thought thing could done 
threw many inducements shape pleasant anticipations bearing right wind upon sunny isles lee 
listened attentively long remained silent almost fancied something jarl would prove much eloquence 
last bluntly declared scheme crazy one never known thing thrice every case runaways never afterwards heard 
entreated renounce determination boy pause reflect stick ship go home like man 
verily viking talked like uncle 
turned deaf ear affirming mind made refused accompany fancied one else comrade would go stark alone rather 
upon seeing resolution immovable bluntly swore would follow thick thin 
thanks jarl thou wert one devoted fellows wrestle hard convince one loved error failing forthwith change wrestling sympathetic hug 
elderly prudence came play 
casting eye boundless expanse inquired far islands question 
thousand miles less 
fair trade breeze boat sail good twelve days passage calms currents may make month perhaps 
saying shook old head yellow hair streamed 
trying best chase away misgivings last gave 
assured might count upon uttermost keel 
viking secured felt ease thoughtfully considered enterprise might best accomplished 
time lost 
every hour carrying us farther farther parallel desirable us follow route westward 
possible dispatch matured plans communicated jarl gave several old hints ulterior probabilities view neglected 
strange relate till viking rueful face reminded fact bethought circumstance somewhat alarming first blush 
must push without chart quadrant though shortly seen compass means question 
chart sure much lay heart quadrant desirable 
still means indispensable 
reason 
started latitude would exactly known whether voyage westward drifted north south therefrom could possibility get far reckoning fail striking one long chain islands many degrees sides equator stretched right across track 
much reason mattered little whether passage daily knew longitude known land lay us place desired reach 
could plainer westward patiently held way must eventually achieve destination intervening shoals reefs intimidated us 
boat drew inches water indifferent look would preclude danger score 
events thing seemed feasible enough notwithstanding old jarl superstitious reverence nautical instruments philosophical objections might urged pedantic disciple mercator 
often old maxim goes simplest things startling simplicity 
cherish alarms thus addressed setting sun thou old pilot guide chapter v seats secured portmanteaus packed thoughts sextants quadrants least cares 
right arches eyebrows thirty men captain mates crew boat abstracted knowing nothing event knowledge would prove unavailing 
hark ye sea boats south sea man generally four number spare ones omitted suspended tackles hooked curved timbers called davits vertically fixed ship sides 
fair one golden locks assiduously waited upon delicately handled tire women slender whale boat crew 
element seems fragile enough justify utmost solicitude

compendious wardrobes snugly packed bundles laid aside present 
last due caution every thing arranged preliminary final start 
let say though perhaps credit jarl whenever strategy necessary seemed ill ease part left matter

viking stalwart seaman pulled midship oar boat bowsman

voyaging seas may glide along weeks without starting tack sheet hardly moving helm spoke mild constant trades 
night watch seldom trouble keeping much look especially strange sail almost prodigy lonely waters

chapter vii pause good old arcturion maternal craft rocked often thy heart oak grieve tell deserted thee broad deep 
far home motley crew many islanders whose heathen babble echoing thy christian hull must grated harshly every carline

still 
thrice pass hand full face slumbering lubber helm right light binnacle

feared approach 
lay quietly though asleep awake delay 
risks must run time presses

work went without hurry swiftly silently 
various stores dragged lurking places placed boat hung ship lee side side depressed water indispensable requisite attempt escape 
though sundown boat windward yet foreseen vessel tacked first watch brought leeward 
endeavoring manhandle clumsy breaker lift boat found reason intervention shrouds could done without risking jar besides straining craft lowering 
expedient however though eleventh hour hit upon

end line secured boat stern 
fortunately last thing done breaker acting clog vessel way water affected steering fling perceptibly wind 
causing helm work must soon rouse lubber stationed already awake 
dropping overboard breaker greatly aided us respect diminished ship headway owing light breeze great time night 
hope escaping without first arresting vessel progress would little short madness 
sole daring deed night achieved consisted lowering away ship yet clove brine though moderately 
ready cranes swung lashings adrift boat fairly suspended seizing ends tackle ropes silently stepped one end 
dead weight breaker astern dragged craft horizontally air tackle ropes strained hard 
quivered like dolphin 
nevertheless feared loud splash upon striking wave might quitted ship almost silently breath body

chapter ix watery world sea open boat thousand miles land shortly break day gray transparent light speck windward broke even line horizon 
ship wending way north eastward 
known final indifference sailors disasters arcturion crew must imputed night past skipper suspect truth would regarded little speck many compunctions conscience 
feel serene humor 
consciousness deemed dead next presumable unpleasantness reality 
one feels like ghost unlawfully tenanting defunct carcass 
even jarl glance seemed queer begged look another way 
secure efforts captain recover probably supposed lost equally cut hope returning ship even felt inclined resolution thus far nerved began succumb measure awful loneliness scene 
ere regarded ocean slave steed bore whither listed whose vicious propensities mighty though often proved harmless opposed genius man

drown swim overboard care cheer jarl ha ha merrily yet terribly sail slowly toiling long calm wave balanced summit like plank rail plunge headlong seething abyss till arrested glide upward 
thus go 
buried watery hollows sail idly flapping lifted aloft canvas bellying beholding furthest horizon 
familiarity business whaling divested craft wild motions first novel horrors rueful pair 
day long pulls whales ship left miles astern entire dark nights passed moored monsters killed late towed ship far leeward much accustoms one strange things 
death sure mouth black wolf thrust jaws serious thing 
true certainly speak hearsay sailors class grisly king seems half hideous appears regarded shore deferential distance 
like many ugly mortals features grow less frightful upon acquaintance met often sociably old adage holds true familiarity breeding contempt 
thus soldiers 
quaking recruit three pitched battles make grim grenadier shrank muzzle cannon ready yield mustache sponge 
truly since death last enemy valiant souls taunt may 
yet rather wise regard inflexible friend even wills life evils triumphantly relieves us 
little difference manner dying

old bardianna another sort spoke right going straight point like javelin especially laid universal maxim minus exceptions men bedeviled

methinks doctrine mankind bedeviled work deal mischief seeing implication absolves mortals moral accountability 
doctrine exceedingly evil yamjamma theory follows must proportionably bedeviled since harms others devil number best limbo since one limboed limboed shall
