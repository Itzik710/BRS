discovery food 
middle years nineteenth century first became abundant strange world class men men tending part become elderly called properly called dislike extremely called scientists 
dislike word much columns nature first distinctive characteristic paper carefully excluded word basis really bad language country 
great public press know better scientists emerge sort publicity distinguished scientists eminent scientists well known scientists least call 
certainly mr bensington professor redwood quite merited terms long came upon marvellous discovery story tells 
mr bensington fellow royal society former president chemical society professor redwood professor physiology bond street college london university grossly libelled anti vivisectionists time time 
led lives academic distinction earliest youth 
course quite undistinguished looking men indeed true scientists 
personal distinction mildest mannered actor alive entire royal society 
mr bensington short bald stooped slightly wore gold rimmed spectacles cloth boots abundantly cut open numerous corns professor redwood entirely ordinary appearance 
happened upon food gods must insist upon calling led lives eminent studious obscurity hard find anything whatever tell reader 
mr bensington spurs one may use expression gentleman boots slashed cloth splendid researches upon toxic alkaloids professor redwood rose eminence clearly remember rose eminence know eminent 
things sort grow 
fancy voluminous work reaction times numerous plates sphygmograph tracings write subject correction admirable new terminology thing 
general public saw little nothing either gentlemen 
sometimes places like royal institution society arts sort way see mr bensington least blushing baldness something collar coat hear fragments lecture paper imagined reading audibly remember one midday vanished past british association dover coming section c letter taken quarters public house following two serious looking ladies paper parcels mere curiosity door labeled billiards pool scandalous darkness broken magic lantern circle redwood tracings

perceived sound sound munching buns sandwiches things assembled british associates come eat cover magic lantern darkness 
redwood remember went talking time lights dabbing place diagram ought visible screen soon darkness restored 
remember ordinary slightly nervous looking dark man air preoccupied something else unaccountable sense duty 
heard bensington also old days educational conference bloomsbury 
like eminent chemists botanists mr bensington authoritative upon teaching though certain would scared wits average board school class half hour far remember propounding improvement professor armstrong heuristic method whereby cost three four hundred pounds worth apparatus total neglect studies undivided attention teacher exceptional gifts average child might peculiar sort thumby thoroughness learn course ten twelve years almost much chemistry one could get one objectionable shilling text books common quite ordinary persons perceive outside science

food gods call substance mr bensington professor redwood made regard already done certainly going surely exaggeration name 
shall continue call therefore throughout story 
mr bensington would called cold blood would gone flat sloane street clad regal scarlet wreath laurel 
phrase mere first cry astonishment 
called food gods enthusiasm hour altogether 
decided absurd 
first thought thing saw vista enormous possibilities literally enormous possibilities upon dazzling vista one stare amazement resolutely shut eyes even conscientious scientist 
food gods sounded blatant pitch indecency 
surprised used expression 
yet something clear eyed moment hung broke ever really know said rubbing hands together laughing nervously theoretical interest 
example confided bringing face close professor dropping undertone would perhaps suitably handled sell precisely said walking away food 
least food ingredient 
assuming course palatable 
thing know till prepared 
turned upon hearthrug studied carefully designed slits upon cloth shoes 
name said looking response inquiry 
part incline good old classical allusion 
makes science res 
gives touch old fashioned dignity

eh nutrition possible hercules know might course think redwood reflected eyes fire made objection 
think would redwood moved head gravely 
might titanophorbia know

insisting upon bensington original name call food gods 
iii 
idea mr bensington suggested one professor redwood contributions philosophical transactions properly consulted gentleman carried 
besides research physiological quite much chemical inquiry 
professor redwood one scientific men addicted tracings curves 
familiar sort reader like sort scientific paper mean 
paper make head tail end come five six long folded diagrams open show peculiar zigzag tracings flashes lightning overdone sinuous inexplicable things called smoothed curves set ordinates rooting abscissae things like 
puzzle thing long time end suspicion understand author understand either 
really know many scientific people understand meaning papers quite well simply defect expression raises obstacle us 
inclined think redwood thought tracings curves 
monumental work upon reaction times unscientific reader exhorted stick little bit longer everything clear daylight redwood began turn smoothed curves sphygmographeries upon growth one papers upon growth really gave mr bensington idea 
redwood know measuring growing things sorts kittens puppies sunflowers mushrooms bean plants wife put stop baby showed growth went regular pace put illustration bursts intermissions sort 
illustration apparently nothing grew regularly steadily far could make nothing could grow regularly steadily every living thing accumulate force grow grew vigor time wait space could go growing 
muffled highly technical language really careful scientist redwood suggested process growth probably demanded presence considerable quantity necessary substance blood formed slowly substance used growth slowly replaced meanwhile organism mark time 
compared unknown substance oil machinery 
growing animal rather like engine suggested move certain distance must oiled run 
one oil engine without said mr bensington read paper 
said redwood delightful nervous inconsecutiveness class might probably found throw light upon mystery certain ductless glands 
though anything subsequent communication redwood went 
gave perfect brock benefit diagrams exactly like rocket trajectories gist far gist blood puppies kittens sap sunflowers juice mushrooms called growing phase differed proportion certain elements blood sap days particularly growing 
mr bensington holding diagrams sideways upside began see difference great amazement came upon 
see difference might probably due presence substance recently trying isolate researches upon alkaloids stimulating nervous system 
put redwood paper patent reading desk swung inconveniently arm chair took gold rimmed spectacles breathed wiped carefully 
jove said mr bensington 
replacing spectacles turned patent reading desk immediately elbow came arm gave coquettish squeak deposited paper diagrams dispersed crumpled state floor 
jove said mr bensington straining stomach armchair patient disregard habits convenience finding pamphlet still reach went fours pursuit 
floor idea calling food gods came see right redwood right injecting administering new substance food would away resting phase instead growth going fashion illustration would follow go thus illustration iv 
night conversation redwood mr bensington could scarcely sleep wink 
seem get sort doze moment dreamt dug deep hole earth poured tons tons food gods earth swelling swelling boundaries countries bursting royal geographical society work like one great guild tailors letting equator course ridiculous dream shows state mental excitement mr bensington got real value attached idea much better things said awake guard 
mentioned general rule think interesting people tell dreams 
singular coincidence redwood also dream night dream illustration diagram done fire upon long scroll abyss 
redwood standing planet sort black platform lecturing new sort growth possible royal institution primordial forces forces always previously even growth races empires planetary systems worlds gone illustration even cases illustration explaining quite lucidly convincingly slow even retrogressive methods would speedily quite put fashion discovery 
ridiculous course shows either dream regarded way significant prophetic beyond categorically said one moment suggest 
chapter second 
experimental farm 
mr bensington proposed originally try stuff soon really able prepare upon tadpoles 
one always try sort thing upon tadpoles begin tadpoles 
agreed conduct experiments redwood redwood laboratory occupied ballistic apparatus animals necessary investigation diurnal variation butting frequency young bull calf investigation yielding curves abnormal perplexing sort presence glass globes tadpoles extremely undesirable particular research progress 
mr bensington conveyed cousin jane something mind put prompt veto upon importation considerable number tadpoles experimental creatures flat 
objection whatever use one rooms flat purposes non explosive chemistry far concerned came nothing let gas furnace sink dust tight cupboard refuge weekly storm cleaning would forego 
known people addicted drink regarded solicitude distinction learned societies excellent substitute coarser form depravity 
sort living things quantity wriggly bound alive smelly dead could would abide 
said things certain unhealthy bensington notoriously delicate man nonsense say bensington tried make enormous importance possible discovery clear said well consented making everything nasty unwholesome place came certain would first complain 
mr bensington went room regardless corns spoke quite firmly angrily without slightest effect 
said nothing ought stand way advancement science said advancement science one thing lot tadpoles flat another said germany ascertained fact man idea like would twenty thousand properly fitted cubic feet laboratory placed disposal said glad always glad german said would make famous ever said much likely make ill lot tadpoles flat like said master house said rather wait lot tadpoles go matron school asked reasonable asked reasonable give tadpoles said might respect ideas said smelly gave way completely said spite classical remarks huxley upon subject bad word 
bad word bad enough 
greatly offended apologised prospect ever trying food gods upon tadpoles flat rate vanished completely apology 
bensington consider way carrying experiments feeding would necessary demonstrate discovery soon substance isolated prepared 
days meditated upon possibility boarding tadpoles trustworthy person chance sight phrase newspaper turned thoughts experimental farm 
chicks 
directly thought thought poultry farm 
suddenly taken vision wildly growing chicks 
conceived picture coops runs outsize still outsize coops runs progressively larger 
chicks accessible easily fed observed much drier handle measure purpose tadpoles seemed comparison quite wild uncontrollable beasts 
quite puzzled understand thought chicks instead tadpoles beginning 
among things would saved trouble cousin jane 
suggested redwood redwood quite agreed 
redwood said working much upon needlessly small animals convinced experimental physiologists made great mistake 
exactly like making experiments chemistry insufficient quantity material errors observation manipulation become disproportionately large 
extreme importance present scientific men assert right material big 
present series experiments bond street college upon bull calves spite certain amount inconvenience students professors subjects caused incidental levity corridors 
curves getting quite exceptionally interesting would published amply justify choice 
part inadequate endowment science country would never could avoid work anything smaller whale 
public vivarium sufficient scale render possible feared present country rate utopian demand 
germany etc 
redwood bull calves needed daily attention selection equipment experimental farm fell largely bensington 
entire cost also understood defrayed bensington least grant could obtained 
accordingly alternated work laboratory flat farm hunting lines run southward london peering spectacles simple baldness lacerated cloth shoes filled owners numerous undesirable properties vain hopes 
advertised several daily papers nature responsible couple married punctual active used poultry take entire charge experimental farm three acres 
found place seemed need hickleybrow near urshot kent 
little queer isolated place dell surrounded old pine woods black forbidding night 
humped shoulder cut sunset gaunt well shattered penthouse dwarfed dwelling 
little house creeperless several windows broken cart shed black shadow midday 
mile half end house village loneliness doubtfully relieved ambiguous family echoes 
place impressed bensington eminently adapted requirements scientific research 
walked premises sketching coops runs sweeping arm found kitchen capable accommodating series incubators foster mothers minimum alteration 
took place way back london stopped dunton green closed eligible couple answered advertisements evening succeeded isolating sufficient quantity herakleophorbia justify engagements 
eligible couple destined mr bensington first almoners earth food gods perceptibly aged also extremely dirty 
latter point mr bensington observe nothing destroys powers general observation quite much life experimental science 
named skinner mr mrs skinner mr bensington interviewed small room hermetically sealed windows spotted overmantel looking glass ailing calceolarias

pupils pay said mrs skinner 
mr skinner appeared large faced man lisp squint made look top head slashed slippers appealed mr bensington sympathies manifest shortness buttons 
held coat shirt together one hand traced patterns black gold tablecloth index finger disengaged eye watched mr bensington sword damocles speak expression sad detachment

mr skinner came closer carpenter hickleybrow spoke confidential manner one sad eye regarded distant village one bright wicked

mr skinner put hand laugh behind refined contagious manner humped shoulders much eye failed participate laughter

food mixed pretty near gone like mix account accident pudding 
best wishes us soliciting continuance esteemed favors respectfully alfred newton skinner 
allusion towards end referred milk pudding herakleophorbia ii 
got mixed painful nearly fatal results skinners 
mr bensington reading lines saw rankness growth attainment long sought goal 
next morning alighted urshot station bag hand carried sealed three tins supply food gods sufficient chicks kent 
bright beautiful morning late may corns much better resolved walk hickleybrow farm 
three miles half altogether park villages along green glades hickleybrow preserves 
trees dusted green spangles high spring hedges full stitchwort campion woods blue hyacinths purple orchid everywhere great noise birds thrushes blackbirds robins finches many one warm corner park bracken unrolling leaping rushing fallow deer 
things brought back mr bensington early forgotten delight life promise discovery grew bright joyful seemed indeed must come upon happiest day life 
sunlit run sandy bank shadow pine trees saw chicks eaten food mixed gigantic gawky bigger already many hen married settleds still growing still first soft yellow plumage faintly marked brown along back knew indeed happiest day come 
mr skinner urgency went runs pecked cracks shoes twice got watched monsters wire netting 
peered close netting followed movements though never seen chick life

mr bensington turned glasses suddenly 
got em almoth ath big plathe said mr skinner better eye piously uplifted letting go little mithith 
mr bensington made usual general inspection premises speedily returned new run 
know truth ever much dared expect 
course science tortuous slow clear promises practical realisation arrives comes almost always year year intricate contrivance foods gods arriving less year testing seemed good good 
hope deferred daily food scientific imagination least seemed

chick said mr bensington cousin jane 
well think knew chick saw said mr bensington cousin jane hotly 
big chick one thing besides see perfectly well chick 
like bustard chick 
part said redwood reluctantly allowing bensington drag argument must confess considering evidence oh said mr bensington cousin jane instead using eyes like sensible person well really miss bensington oh go said cousin jane 
men alike 
considering evidence certainly falls within definition doubt abnormal hypertrophied still especially since hatched egg normal hen yes think miss bensington must admit far one call anything sort chick 
mean chick said cousin jane 
think chick said redwood 
nonsense said mr bensington cousin jane oh directed redwood head patience suddenly turned went room slam 
great relief see bensington said redwood reverberation slam died away 
spite big 
without urgency mr bensington sat low arm chair fire confessed proceedings even unscientific man would indiscreet 
think rash bensington know said fact put little much baby bottle nearly week ago suppose cried mr bensington 
know said redwood glanced giant chick upon plate table 
turned right thank goodness felt pocket cigarettes 
gave fragmentary details 
poor little chap putting weight desperately anxious 
winkles frightful duffer former pupil mine good mrs redwood unmitigated confidence winkles know man manner like cliff towering confidence course taught winkles scarcely allowed nursery something done slipped nurse breakfast got bottle 
grow said mr bensington 
growing 
twenty seven ounces last week hear winkles 
management said 
dear skinner says redwood looked chick 
bother keep said 
trust nursery alone tried get growth curve georgina phyllis know give second dose need crying two days get ordinary food anyhow

tell winkles 
hang winkles said redwood 
might get winkles give powders give child shall said redwood resting chin fist staring fire 
bensington stood space smoothing breast giant chick 
monstrous fowls said 
said redwood still eyes glow 
big horses said bensington

bensington turned away specimen 
redwood said fowls going create sensation 
redwood nodded head fire 
jove said bensington coming round suddenly flash spectacles little boy thinking said redwood 
sat back sighed threw unconsumed cigarette fire thrust hands deep trousers pockets 
precisely thinking 
herakleophorbia going queer stuff handle 
pace chick must grown little boy growing pace said mr bensington slowly stared chick spoke 
say said bensington big 
shall give diminishing doses said redwood 
rate winkles 
rather much experiment 
much 
yet still know must confess baby sooner later try 
oh try baby certainly 
exactly said bensington came stood hearthrug took spectacles wipe 
saw chicks redwood think began realize anything possibilities making 
beginning dawn upon possible consequences even know mr bensington far conception mine little train would fire

happened early june 
weeks bensington kept revisiting experimental farm severe imaginary catarrh one necessary flying visit made redwood 
returned even anxious looking parent gone 
altogether seven weeks steady uninterrupted growth wasps began career 
late july nearly week hens escaped hickleybrow first big wasps killed 
report appeared several papers know whether news reached mr bensington much less whether connected general laxity method prevailed experimental farm
