long time elapsed one dreamt questioning unity authorship homeric poems 
grave cautious thucydides quoted without hesitation hymn apollo authenticity already disclaimed modern critics 
longinus oft quoted passage merely expressed opinion touching comparative inferiority odyssey iliad among mass ancient authors whose names would tedious detail suspicion personal non existence homer ever arose 
far voice antiquity seems favor early ideas subject let us see discoveries modern investigations lay claim 
end seventeenth century doubts begun awaken subject find bentley remarking homer wrote sequel songs rhapsodies sung small comings good cheer festivals days merriment 
loose songs collected together form epic poem till peisistratus time five hundred years 
two french writers hedelin perrault avowed similar scepticism subject scienza nuova battista vico first meet germ theory subsequently defended wolf much learning acuteness 
indeed wolfian theory chiefly deal following bold hypothesis detail words grote half century ago acute valuable prolegomena f wolf turning account venetian scholia recently published first opened philosophical discussion history homeric text 
considerable part dissertation though means whole employed vindicating position previously announced bentley amongst others separate constituent portions iliad odyssey cemented together compact body unchangeable order days peisistratus sixth century christ 
step towards conclusion wolf maintained written copies either poem could shown existed earlier times composition referred without writing neither perfect symmetry complicated work could originally conceived poet realized transmitted assurance posterity 
absence easy convenient writing must indispensably supposed long manuscripts among early greeks thus one points wolf case primitive integrity iliad odyssey 
nitzsch leading opponents wolf connection one seems accepted originally put considered incumbent defended ancient aggregate character iliad odyssey maintain written poems beginning 
appears architectonic functions ascribed wolf peisistratus associates reference homeric poems nowise admissible 
much would undoubtedly gained towards view question could shown order controvert driven necessity admitting long written poems ninth century christian aera 
things opinion improbable mr payne knight opposed wolfian hypothesis admits less wolf 
traces writing greece even seventh century christian aera exceedingly trifling 
remaining inscription earlier fortieth olympiad early inscriptions rude unskilfully executed even assure whether archilochus simonides amorgus kallinus tyrtaeus xanthus early elegiac lyric poets committed compositions writing time practice became familiar 
first positive ground authorizes us presume existence manuscript homer famous ordinance solon regard rhapsodies panathenaea length time previously manuscripts existed unable say 
maintain homeric poems written beginning rest case upon positive proofs yet upon existing habits society regard poetry admit generally iliad odyssey read recited heard upon supposed necessity must manuscripts ensure preservation poems unassisted memory reciters neither sufficient trustworthy 
escape smaller difficulty running greater existence trained bards gifted extraordinary memory far less astonishing long manuscripts age essentially non reading non writing even suitable instruments materials process obvious 
moreover strong positive reason believing bard necessity refreshing memory consulting manuscript fact blindness would disqualification profession know well example demodokus odyssey blind bard chios hymn delian apollo thucydides well general tenor grecian legend identifies homer 
author hymn may could never described blind man attaining utmost perfection art conscious memory bard maintained constant reference manuscript chest 
loss digamma crux critics quicksand upon even acumen bentley shipwrecked seems prove beyond doubt pronunciation greek language undergone considerable change 
certainly difficult suppose homeric poems could suffered change written copies preserved 
chaucer poetry instance written could come us softened form like effeminate version dryden rough quaint noble original 
period continues grote poems indeed greek poems first began written must matter conjecture though ground assurance time solon 
absence evidence may venture upon naming determinate period question suggests purposes state society manuscript first commencement must intended answer written iliad necessary rhapsodes planted memory also interwoven feelings conceived conjunction flexions intonations voice pauses oral artifices required emphatic delivery naked manuscript could never reproduce 
general public accustomed receive rhapsodic delivery accompaniments solemn crowded festival 
persons written iliad would suitable would select studious curious men class readers capable analyzing complicated emotions experienced hearers crowd would perusing written words realize imaginations sensible portion impression communicated reciter 
incredible statement may seem age like present early societies early greece time reading class existed 
could discover time class first began formed able make guess time old epic poems first committed writing 
period may greatest probability fixed upon first witnessed formation even narrowest reading class greece middle seventh century christian aera bc bc age terpander kallinus archilochus simenides amorgus c ground supposition change operated character tendencies grecian poetry music elegiac iambic measures introduced rivals primitive hexameter poetical compositions transferred epical past affairs present real life 
change important time poetry known mode publication use modern phrase altogether suitable yet nearest approaching sense 
argued new way looking old epical treasures people well thirst new poetical effect men stood forward may well considered desirous study competent criticize individual point view written words homeric rhapsodies told kallinus noticed eulogized thebais production homer 
seems therefore ground conjecturing use newly formed important narrow class manuscripts homeric poems old epics thebais cypria well iliad odyssey began compiled towards middle seventh century bc opening egypt grecian commerce took place period would furnish increased facilities obtaining requisite papyrus write upon 
reading class formed would doubtless slowly increase number manuscripts along time solon fifty years afterwards readers manuscripts though still comparatively might attained certain recognized authority formed tribunal reference carelessness individual rhapsodies 
even peisistratus suffered remain possession credit help feeling force following observations several incidental circumstances opinion throw suspicion whole history peisistratid compilation least theory iliad cast present stately harmonious form directions athenian ruler 
great poets flourished bright period grecian song alas inherited little fame faint echo stesichorus anacreon simonides employed noble task compiling iliad odyssey much must done arrange connect harmonize almost incredible stronger marks athenian manufacture remain 
whatever occasional anomalies may detected anomalies doubt arise ignorance language homeric age however irregular use digamma may perplexed bentleys name helen said caused much disquiet distress fair one among heroes age however mr knight may failed reducing homeric language primitive form however finally attic dialect may assumed marked distinguishing characteristics still difficult suppose language particularly joinings transitions connecting parts clearly betray incongruity ancient modern forms expression 
quite character period imitate antique style order piece imperfect poem character original sir walter scott done continuation sir tristram 
however even faint indistinct traces athenian compilation discoverable language poems total absence athenian national feeling perhaps less worthy observation 
later may fairly suspected earlier times athenians ordinarily jealous fame ancestors 
amid traditions glories early greece embodied iliad athenians play subordinate insignificant part 
even passages relate ancestors mr knight suspects interpolations 
possible indeed leading outline iliad may true historic fact great maritime expedition western greece rival half kindred empire laomedontiadae chieftain thessaly valor number forces may important ally peloponnesian sovereign pre eminent value ancient poetry trojan war may thus forced national feeling athenians yield taste 
songs spoke great ancestor doubt far inferior sublimity popularity first sight theseid would much likely emanated athenian synod compilers ancient song achilleid odysseid 
could france given birth tasso tancred would hero jerusalem 
however homeric ballads sometimes called related wrath achilles direful consequences far superior rest poetic cycle admit rivalry still surprising throughout whole poem callida junctura never betray workmanship athenian hand national spirit race later period inaptly compared self admiring neighbors french submit lofty self denial almost total exclusion ancestors least questionable dignity produced leader tolerably skilled military tactics age 
return wolfian theory 
confessed wolf objections primitive integrity iliad odyssey never wholly got help discovering failed enlighten us substantial point difficulties whole subject beset rather augmented otherwise admit hypothesis 
lachmann modification theory better 
divides first twenty two books iliad sixteen different songs treats ridiculous belief amalgamation one regular poem belongs period earlier age peisistratus 
grote observes ex plains gaps contradictions narrative explains nothing else 
moreover find contradictions warranting belief called sixteen poets concur getting rid following leading men first battle secession achilles elphenor chief euboeans tlepolemus rhodians pandarus lycians odins halizonians pirous acamas thracians 
none heroes make appearance agree colonel mure seems strange number independent poets harmoniously dispensed services six sequel 
discrepancy pylaemenes represented dead fifth book weeps son funeral thirteenth regarded result interpolation 
grote although distinct stating opinions subject done much clearly show incongruity wolfian theory lachmann modifications character peisistratus 
also shown think equal success two questions relative primitive unity poems supposing impossible unison parts peisistratus time essentially distinct 
short man may believe iliad put together pre existing songs without recognizing age peisistratus period first compilation 
friends literary employes peisistratus must found iliad already ancient silence alexandrine critics respecting peisistratic recension goes far prove among numerous manuscripts examined either wanting thought unworthy attention 
moreover continues whole tenor poems confirms remarked 
nothing either iliad odyssey savors modernism applying term age peisistratus nothing brings view alterations brought two centuries greek language coined money habits writing reading despotisms republican governments close military array improved construction ships amphiktyonic convocations mutual frequentation religious festivals oriental egyptian veins religion c familiar latter epoch 
alterations onomakritus literary friends peisistratus could hardly failed notice even without design first time undertaken task piecing together many self existent epics one large aggregate 
everything two great homeric poems substance language belongs age two three centuries earlier peisistratus 
indeed even interpolations passages best grounds pronounced betray trace sixth century christ may well heard archilochus kallinus cases even arktinus hesiod genuine homeric matter 
far evidences case well internal external enable us judge seem warranted believing iliad odyssey recited substantially stand always allowing partial divergences text interpolations bc first trustworthy mark grecian time ancient date let added best authenticated fact also important attribute homeric poems considered reference grecian history thus afford us insight anti historical character greeks enabling us trace subsequent forward march nation seize instructive contrasts former later condition 
whole inclined believe labors peisistratus wholly editorial character although must confess lay nothing respecting extent labors 
time far believing composition primary arrangement poems present form work peisistratus rather persuaded fine taste elegant mind athenian would lead preserve ancient traditional order poems rather patch reconstruct according fanciful hypothesis 
repeat many discussions respecting whether poems written whether art writing known time reputed author 
suffice say read less satisfied upon either subject 
however help thinking story attributes preservation poems lycurgus little else version story peisistratus historical probability must measured many others relating spartan confucius 
conclude sketch homeric theories attempt made ingenious friend unite something like consistency 
follows doubt common soldiers age like common sailors fifty years ago one qualified discourse excellent music among 
many like negroes united states extemporaneous allusive events passing around 
passing around grand events spirit stirring war occurrences likely impress mystical legends former times done upon memory besides retentive memory deemed virtue first water cultivated accordingly ancient times 
ballads first beginning war troy merely recitations intonation 
followed species recitative probably intoned burden 
tune next followed aided memory considerably 
period four hundred years war poet flourished name melesigenes moeonides probably former 
saw ballads might made great utility purpose writing poem social position hellas collection published lays connecting tale 
poem exists title odyssea 
author however affix name poem fact great part remodelled archaic dialect crete tongue ballads found 
therefore called poem homeros collector rather proof modesty talent mere drudging arrangement people ideas grote finely observed arguing unity authorship great poet might cast pre existing separate songs one comprehensive whole mere arrangers compilers would competent 
employed wild legend odysseus met ballad recording quarrel achilles agamemnon 
noble mind seized hint presented achilleis grew hand 
unity design however caused publish poem pseudonyme former work disjointed lays ancient bards joined together like relating cid chronicle history named iliad 
melesigenes knew poem destined lasting one proved first poems destined undergo many vicissitudes corruptions people took singing streets assemblies agoras 
however solon first peisistratus afterwards aristoteles others revised poems restored works melesigenes homeros original integrity great measure 
thus given general notion strange theories developed respecting interesting subject must still express conviction unity authorship homeric poems 
deny many corruptions interpolations disfigure intrusive hand poetasters may inflicted wound serious negligence copyist would absurd captious assumption higher criticism must appeal would either understand enjoy poems 
maintaining authenticity personality one author homer melesigenes quocunque nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit feel conscious whole weight historical evidence hypothesis would assign great works plurality authors powerful internal evidence springs deepest immediate impulse soul also speaks eloquently contrary 
minutiae verbal criticism far seeking despise 
indeed considering character books attempt would gross inconsistency 
appreciate importance philological view inclined set little store aesthetic value especially poetry 
three parts emendations made upon poets mere alterations suggested author maecenas africanus would probably adopted 
moreover exact laying rules verbal criticism interpretation often least competent carry precepts 
grammarians poets profession may per accidens 
moment remember two emendations homer calculated substantially improve poetry passage although mass remarks herodotus loewe given us history thousand minute points without greek knowledge would gloomy jejune 
words grammarians mere grammarians exercise elaborate often tiresome ingenuity 
binding heroic dramatic poet block upon previously dissected words sentences proceed use axe pruning knife wholesale inconsistent everything wish make case unlawful affiliation cut book book passage passage till author reduced collection fragments till fancied possessed works great man find put vile counterfeit got second hand 
compare theories knight wolf lachmann others shall feel better satisfied utter uncertainty criticism apocryphal position homer 
one rejects another considers turning point theory 
one cuts supposed knot expunging another would explain omitting something else 
morbid species sagacity means looked upon literary novelty 
justus lipsius scholar ordinary skill seems revel imaginary discovery tragedies attributed seneca four different authors 
venture assert tragedies uniform borrowed phraseology phraseology writers like boethius saxo grammaticus charmed freedom real poetry last least ultra refined consistent abandonment good taste writers present day would question capabilities gentleman seneca produce great many equally bad 
equal sagacity father hardouin astonished world startling announcement aeneid virgil satires horace literary deceptions 
without wishing say one word disrespect industry learning nay refined acuteness scholars like wolf bestowed upon subject must express fears many modern homeric theories become matter surprise entertainment rather instruction posterity 
help thinking literary history recent times account many points difficulty transmission iliad odyssey period remote first creation 
already expressed belief labors peisistratus purely editorial character seems reason corrupt imperfect editions homer may abroad day poems valerius flaccus tibullus given much trouble poggio scaliger others 
main fault homeric theories demand great sacrifice feelings poetry powerfully appeals fitting judges 
ingenuity sought rob us name existence homer much violence inward emotion makes whole soul yearn love admiration blind bard chios 
believe author iliad mere compiler degrade powers human invention elevate analytical judgment expense ennobling impulses soul forget ocean contemplation polypus 
catholicity speak name homer 
faith author iliad may mistaken one yet nobody taught us better 
however look upon belief homer one nature mainspring join old ennius believing homer ghost like patron saint hovers round bed poet even bestows rare gifts wealth imagination host imitators could exhaust still far wishing deny author great poems found rich fund tradition well stocked mythical storehouse whence might derive subject embellishment 
one thing use existing romances embellishment poem another patch poem materials 
consistency style execution hoped attempt rather bad taste tedium infallible result blending popular legends free use songs bards features perfectly consistent poetical originality 
fact original writer still drawing upon outward impressions nay even thoughts kind secondary agents support feed impulses imagination 
unless grand pervading principle invisible yet distinctly stamped archetypus great whole poem like iliad never come birth 
traditions picturesque episodes pathetic local associations teeming thoughts gods great men may crowd one mighty vision reveal substantial forms mind poet except power create grand whole shall details embellishments present shall nought scrap book parterre filled flowers weeds strangling wild redundancy shall cento rags tatters require little acuteness detect 
sensible difficulty disproving negative aware must weighty grounds opposing belief still seems homeric question one reserved higher criticism often obtained 
nature intended know things still less compass powers greatest blessings life placed disposal 
faith virtue might indeed wonder god willed ignorance matter 
well taught contrary lesson seems though faith especially tried touching men events wrought influence upon condition humanity 
kind sacredness attached memory great good seems bid us repulse scepticism would allegorize existence pleasing apologue measure giants intellect homaeopathic dynameter 
long habitual reading homer appears familiarize thoughts even incongruities rather read right spirit heartfelt appreciation much dazzled deeply wrapped admiration whole dwell upon minute spots mere analysis discover 
reading heroic poem must transform heroes time imagination must fight battles woo loves burn sense injury achilles hector 
attain degree enthusiasm less enthusiasm scarcely suffice reading homer shall feel poems homer work one writer greatest writer ever touched hearts men power song 
supposed unity authorship gave poems powerful influence minds men old 
heeren evidently little disposed favor modern theories finely observes homer formed character greek nation 
poet ever poet exercised similar influence countrymen 
prophets lawgivers sages formed character nations reserved poet form greeks 
feature character wholly erased even period degeneracy 
lawgivers sages appeared greece work poet already accomplished paid homage superior genius 
held nation mirror behold world gods heroes less feeble mortals behold reflected purity truth 
poems founded first feeling human nature love children wife country passion outweighs others love glory 
songs poured forth breast sympathized feelings man therefore enter continue enter every breast cherishes sympathies 
granted immortal spirit another heaven dreamed earth look race see nations fields asia forests hercynia performing pilgrimages fountain magic wand caused flow permitted view vast assemblage grand elevated glorious productions called means songs wherever immortal spirit may reside alone would suffice complete happiness 
contemplate ancient monument apotheosis homer depictured feel much pleasing association much appeals forcibly distinctly minds lost admittance theory old tradition read think think becomes readers homer rooted becomes conviction father poetry gave us rich inheritance whole entire 
whatever means preservation let us rather thankful treasury taste eloquence thus laid open use seek make mere center around drive series theories whose wildness equalled inconsistency

days called literal translation less cultivated present 
something like general sense could decorated easy gracefulness practiced poet charms metrical cadence pleasing fluency could made consistent fair interpretation poet meaning words less jealously sought could read good poem pope iliad fair reason satisfied
