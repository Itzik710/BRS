daniel defoe perhaps best known us author robinson crusoe book delight generations boys girls ever since beginning eighteenth century 
defoe lived wrote one new school prose writers grew time gave england new forms literature almost unknown earlier age 
defoe vigorous pamphleteer writing first whig side later tories reigns william iii anne 
much foster growth newspaper form literature henceforth became popular 
also much towards development modern novel though write novels sense word 
books simple modern novel 
really wrote long stories told robinson crusoe first person much detail hard believe works imagination true stories 
little art truly master forging story imposing upon world truth 
wrote one contemporaries 
charles lamb criticizing defoe notices minuteness detail remarks therefore author suited servants meaning method appeal comparatively uneducated minds 
really every boy girl knows good story ought quality seeming true fact defoe deceive us makes work excellent reading 
memoirs cavalier resembles robinson crusoe far tale told man experiences adventures 
air truth long time first publication people divided opinion whether book real memoirs 
critical examination shown defoe work declares contents manuscript found great accident among valuable papers belonging one king william secretaries state 
although gifts imagination enabled throw position cavalier lapses occasionally characteristic prose style often eighteenth rather seventeenth century eloquent quaint 
careful hide inconsistencies preface text 
thus says preface discovered manuscript yet find memoirs reference restoration shows must written least 
abundant proof book really work fiction cavalier imaginary character one sense true history inasmuch author studied events spirit time scene laid though makes many mistakes detail gives us true picture one interesting periods english european history 
memoirs thus represent english historical novel beginnings much simpler thing become hands scott later writers 
period scene laid english civil war cavalier fought side king charles puritans 
adventures war belong second part book 
first part tells birth parentage foreign travel fashionable completion education gentleman seventeenth century adventures volunteer officer swedish army gained experience serve well civil war home 
many real cavalier must career defoe hero describes 
short time oxford long enough gentleman embarked period travel going italy way france 
cavalier however devotes little space description vivid enough far goes adventures two countries space two years 
italy especially attracted attention gentlemen scholars days cavalier bent soldiering sightseeing hurries tell adventures germany first really took part warfare becoming volunteer officer army gustavus adolphus hero king sweden met adventures story forms bulk first part memoirs 
appreciate tale necessary clear idea state affairs europe time 
war convulsing germany almost every european power interfered time thirty years war struggle special character last religious wars torn europe asunder century first long series wars new purely political principle balance power seen work 
struggle nominally protestant catholic germany reformation period germany consisted numerous states headship emperor split two great camps 
northern states become protestant protestant princes 
southern states remained part catholic back catholicism religious reaction known counter reformation 
catholic movement spread catholic emperor like ferdinand styria elected inevitable privileges granted protestants curtailed 
determined resist emperor support spain protestant union found necessary call help outside 
thus european powers came interfere german affairs 
helped protestants motives religion still considerations policy long struggle thirty years may divided marked periods one power another denmark sweden france allied protestants emperor 
memoirs concerned first two years swedish period war gustavus adolphus almost victory protestants however lose advantage brilliant generalship death battle luetzen 
death conquering king swedes lost fruits victory battle luetzen marks end may termed heroic period war 
gustavus adolphus stands among men day loftiness character well genius generalship 
therefore fitting enough defoe make cavalier withdraw swedish service death glorious king could never mention without remark extraordinary merit 
two years longer wanders germany still watching course war returns england soon take part another war home namely civil war english people divided two great parties according supported king charles members long parliament opposed 
according memoirs cavalier went arms without troubling examine sides 
defoe probably considered attitude typical many cavalier party course loyalty king person one strongest motives 
cavalier enter largely causes war 
gives us picture army life troubled period 
well however bear mind chief facts history times 
beginning reign charles trouble parliaments already become restless james charles parliaments disapproved foreign policy unwillingness grant subsidies led fall back questionable methods raising money especially eleven years ruled without parliament 
charles great scheme tyranny avoided parliaments criticism policy 
first opposition purely political parliament attacked also charles religious policy 
favored schemes laud archbishop canterbury arminian school among clergy wished revive many old catholic practices beliefs swept away reformation 
many people england objected even wearing surplice simplest old vestments use laud tried insist 
party came known puritans formed chief strength opposition king long parliament met 
attack church led many first opposed king arbitrary methods go side 
thus moderate men well loyalists formed king party opposition almost confined men hated church much king 
puritans loved simplicity dress severity manners despised flowing locks worldly vanities cavaliers loved nicknamed roundheads account short hair 
defoe memoirs gives us less side history times might expected 
war actually began august defoe gives us military history correct essentials full detail however far accurate 
instance account battle marston moor makes prince rupert command left wing whereas really commanded right wing left led lord goring according defoe account commanded main battle 
conveys us however true spirit war emphasizing ability mistakes sides showing king miscalculations rupert rashness deprived royalist party advantages superior generalship fighting power first part war gradually roundheads got better cavaliers 
detailed narrative comes end delivery king parliament scots given extremity 
lines tell trial execution memoirs end pages remarks observations war list coincidences noted course 
latter savoring somewhat superstition appear natural purports seventeenth century text summing conclusions war rather might made less impartial observer later date one taken active part struggle 
reading memoirs mixture belongs seventeenth century reflections defoe many ways typical eighteenth century figure must borne mind

fate rather reason certainly blinded rest generals arguments 
duke bernhard almost generals fighting alleging affront would swedish reputation see friends town lost faces 
gustavus horn stood stiff cautious advice thought baron offkirk treated little indecently warm matter told gustavus adolphus governed cowardly counsel never conqueror half germany two years 
replied old general horn smartly alive testified never taken coward yet says king never victory hazard could without 
asked opinion would declined commission pressed speak 
told staying least till rhinegrave came least might expresses sent hasten us twenty four hours 
offkirk could hold passion overruled would almost quarrelled marshal horn 
upon old general foment great deal mildness stood spoke thus come offkirk says submit opinion majority fellow soldiers 
fight upon word shall hands full 
resolution thus taken attacked imperial army 
must confess counsels day seemed confused resolutions night 
duke bernhard lead van left wing post upon hill enemy right without entrenchments secured post might level cannon upon foot stood behind lines relieved town pleasure 
marched accordingly break day falling great fury upon eight regiments foot posted foot hill presently routed made master post 
flushed success never regards concerted measures stopping possessing got pushes falls main body enemy army 
gustavus horn attacks another post hill spaniards posted lodged behind works cast side hill 
defended extreme obstinacy five hours last obliged swedes give loss 
extraordinary gallantry spaniards saving imperial army duke bernhard resisted frequent charges imperialists borne weight two thirds army able stand longer sending one messenger neck another gustavus horn foot finding could carry point given full march second duke 
late king hungary seeing duke men wavering notice horn wheeling second falls force upon flank hungarian hussars made furious charge swedes could stand longer 
rout left wing much unhappy happened upon gustavus horn coming pushed enemies heels driven upon friends ground open give way trodden runaway brethren 
brought utmost confusion 
imperialists cried victoria fell middle infantry terrible slaughter 
always observed tis fatal upbraid old experienced officer want courage 
gustavus horn whetted reproaches baron offkirk general officers believe saved lives thousand men thus lost several officers advised make retreat regiments yet unbroken nothing could persuade stir foot 
turning flank front saluted enemy passed pursuit rest terrible volleys small shot cost lives abundance men 
imperialists eager pursuit left unbroken till spanish brigade came charged 
bravely repulsed great slaughter body dragoons till laid every side men killed brave old general rest left made prisoners 
swedes terrible loss almost infantry killed taken prisoners 
gustavus horn refused quarter several times still attacked cut men fought like furies example general behaved like lions 
last poor remains body bravest men world forced submit 
heard say much rather died taken yielded compassion many brave men none would take quarter till gave consent 
worst share battle ever action life posted among brave body horse germany yet able succor men foot cut pieces faces situation ground could fall 
able carry foot running away rout left wing rallied among squadrons got away us 
thus stood till saw lost made best retreat could save several regiments never charged fired shot foot embarrassed among lines works enemy vineyards mountains horse rendered absolutely unserviceable 
rhinegrave made expedition join us reached within three miles place action night great safeguard us rallying dispersed men else fallen enemy hands checking pursuit enemy 
indeed considerable body foot made orderly retreat probable given enemy brush would turned scale victory horse whole manner untouched enemy found check pursuit forwardest men following eagerly fell rhinegrave advanced troops next day cut pieces without mercy 
gave us satisfaction loss small compared ruin day 
lost near men upon spot prisoners cannon baggage colors 
thought never made indifferent figure life thought come away lose infantry general honor never fight 
duke bernhard utterly disconsolate old gustavus horn concluded killed tore hair head like madman telling rhinegrave story council war would reproach taking advice often repeating passion 
tis said death bravest general germany would call fool boy names listening reasons old experienced soldier 
heard alive enemy hands easier applied recruiting troops like business war long paid imperialists interest 
returned frankfort au main action happened th august progress imperialists great staying frankfort 
chancellor oxenstiern removed magdeburg duke bernhard landgrave marched alsatia imperialists carried rest campaign 
took philipsburg surprise took augsburg famine spire treves sieges taking elector prisoner 
success one piece service swedes brought french war side elector treves confederate 
french gave conduct war duke bernhard 
though duke saxony fell fought turned scale much favor recovered losses proved terror germany 
farther accounts war refer histories times since read great deal delight 
confess saw progress imperial army battle noerdlingen duke saxony turning arms thought affairs declining giving lost left frankfort came rhine cologne thence holland 
came hague th march spent three years half germany greatest part swedish army 
spent time holland viewing wonderful power art observed fortifications towns bastions stand bottomless morasses yet firm world 
opportunity seeing dutch army famous general prince maurice 
tis true men behaved well enough action put prince way beating enemies without fighting unlike gallantry royal instructor manner relish 
way germany always seek enemy fight give imperialists due seldom hard found free flesh 
whereas prince maurice would lie camp till starved half men lying could starve two thirds enemies indeed war holland fatigues hardships fighting blows 
hasty marches long unwholesome encampments winter parties counter marching dodging entrenching exercises men oftentimes killed men hunger cold diseases could fighting 
required less courage rather soldier time rather die field la coup de mousquet starved hunger frozen death trenches 
think lessen reputation great general tis certain ruined spaniard spinning war thus length could possibly done swift conquest 
gustavus like torrent victory dislodged spaniard twelve provinces five years whereas forty years beating seven left rich strong home able keep constant apprehensions return power 
whereas long continuance war broke heart spanish monarchy absolutely irrecoverably impoverished ever since languished disease till fallen powerful despicable nation world 
prodigious charge king spain losing seven provinces broke spirit nation much wealth peruvian mountains able retrieve king philip often declared war besides armada invading england cost ducats best soldiers europe whereof unreasonable spanish obstinacy lost lives ostend town worth sixth part either blood money cost siege three years last never taken prince maurice thought worth charge defending longer 
however say way fighting holland relish 
prince lay long time little fort called schenkenschanz spaniard took surprise thought might taken much sooner 
perhaps might mistake fancied hero king sweden would carried sword hand half time 
however like latter end year came hague took shipping england arrived great satisfaction father friends 
father london carried kiss king hand 
majesty pleased receive well say great many obliging things father upon account 
spent time retired court almost wholly country much different genius hankered warmer sport hunting among welsh mountains could peeping foreign accounts germany see together

father unwilling let go seeing uneasy told resolved would oblige stay longer england next spring consent 
winter following began look unpleasant upon us england father used often sigh would tell sometimes afraid need send englishmen fight germany 
cloud seemed threaten scotland 
father made master arguments sides used often saying feared king exasperated much scots drove things high

armies lay counties northumberland durham ate country spent king vast sum money war ended pacification made sides returned 
truth never saw despicable appearance men arms begin war life whether seen many braver armies abroad prejudiced really seemed little better rabble met together devour rather fight king country 
indeed great appearance gentlemen extraordinary quality garb equipages mien look like war troops filled footmen servants wretchedly armed god wot 
believe might say without vanity one regiment finland horse would made sport beating 
crowds parsons church war particular camp court full king eternally besieged clergymen one sort another gave offence chief nobility 
appearance service 
army marched borders headquarter berwick upon tweed scots never appeared much scouts whereupon king called council war resolved send earl holland party horse scotland learn news enemy 
truly first news brought us finding army encamped coldingham fifteen miles berwick soon appeared scots drew party charge upon men halted say run away twas next door could persuaded fire pistols wheel like soldiers retreated disorderly shameful manner enemy either courage conduct followed must certainly ended ruin whole party 
footnote upon breach match king england infanta spain particularly upon old quarrel king bohemia palatinate 
second part confess went arms beginning war never troubled examine sides glad hear drums beat soldiers mere swiss cared side went pay 
went eagerly blindly business meanest wretch listed army least compassionate thought miseries native country till fight edgehill 
known much perhaps army enemy ranging bowels kingdom seen flourishing provinces germany reduced perfect deserts voracious crabats inhuman barbarity quenching fires plundered villages blood inhabitants 
whether hardened natural tenderness afterwards found return upon tell reflected upon afterwards great deal trouble unconcernedness temper approaching ruin native country 
first army york already noted must confess least diversion ever found army life 
germany king sweden used see king general officers every morning horseback viewing men artillery horses always something going forward 
saw nothing courtiers clergymen bishops parsons busy direction war 
king seldom seen among us never without always 
us seen wars would made short end began uneasy particularly certain nobleman took freedom tell king clergy would certainly ruin expedition 
case would king immediately marched scotland put matter trial battle urged every day 
king finding reasons good would often opinion next morning would another mind 
gentleman man conduct enough unquestioned courage afterwards lost life king 
saw army young stout fellows numerous enough though yet seen much service bringing action scots might time strengthen time idleness sotting bane soldiers make unfit anything 
one morning company gentleman warm man eager discourse pox priests says tis king raised army put friends vast charge come let us fight 
afterwards convinced clergy saw matter 
saw scots better army bold ready commanded brave officers foresaw fought beaten beaten undone 
twas true ruined engaged 
true came pacification followed confess mind gentleman better fought beaten made dishonourable treaty without striking stroke 
pacification seems laid scheme blood confusion followed civil war 
whatever king friends might pretend talking big scots saw bullied anything came push courtiers never cared bring blows 
little nothing say action mock expedition 
king persuaded last march berwick said already party horse went learn news scots soon saw ran away bravely 
made scots insolent whereas lay encamped behind river never showed sort modest deference king pretence aggressors invaders arming defense invaded english troops entering scotland wanted 
show fear retained policy came parties gates braving facing us every day 
curiosity discretion put volunteer head one parties horse lord holland went discover enemy went said see scots 
marched far scouts brought word discovered horse could come river parted 
heels came another party men upon spur us said enemy behind might true aught knew far behind nobody could see yet country plain open mile us 
hereupon made halt indeed afraid would odd sort halt men began look one upon another like cases going break scouts came galloping men disorder one man broke away satisfied run 
found lord holland perceive first surprise little told lord observed unless course immediately taken would run first sight enemy 
found much concerned began consult course take prevent 
confess tis hard question make men stand face enemy fear possessed minds inclination run away 
give honor memory noble gentleman though experience matters war small never much service yet courage made amends daresay would turned horse army enemies saved life price running away 
lord soon saw well fright men given hint encourage rode ranks spoke cheerfully used arguments thought proper settle minds 
remembered saying heard old marshal gustavus horn speak germany find men falter doubt never suffer halt keep advancing going forward keeps courage 
soon could get opportunity speak gave opinion 
well says lord studying says post run would stand face enemy fear afterwards 
discoursing thus word brought several parties enemies seen farther side river upon lord gave word march marching lord calls lieutenant old soldier five troopers confidence given lesson sends away 
quarter hour one five troopers comes back galloping hallooing tells us lieutenant small party beaten party twenty enemy horse river secured pass desired lord would march immediately 
tis strange thing men spirits subjected sudden changes capable much alteration shadows things 
running saw enemy haste led raw men obliged bear anything disorder intolerable 
story premeditated sham word truth invented raise spirits cheat cowardly phlegmatic apprehensions lord end fire fall 
persuaded led immediately battle begun hands would laid like furies nothing like victory flush young soldier 
thus humor high fermentation lasted away marched passing one great commons call moors came river called lieutenant posted four men twas little brook fordable ease leaving guard pass advanced top small ascent whence fair view scots army lay behind another river larger former 
men posted well enough behind small enclosure narrow lane front 
lord caused dragoons placed front line hedges posture stood viewing enemy distance 
scots intelligence coming drew three small parties sent different ways observe number forming fourth party guessed horse advanced top plain drew face us never offered attack us 
one small parties making men one third foot passes upon flank view reach marched shouted us men better pleased work fighting readily enough answered would fain fired pleasure making noise far hit 
observed parties always foot yet horse galloped pushed ever forward foot forward extraordinary advantage 
gustavus adolphus king soldiers first ever observed found advantage mixing small bodies musketeers among horse nimble strong fellows would prized rest men 
call highlanders 
would run foot arms accoutrements keep good order yet keep pace horse let go rate would 
saw foot thus interlined among horse together way ordering flying parties presently occurred mind old scots come home germany ordering matters knew match 
thus stood facing enemy till scouts brought us word whole scots army motion full march attack us though true fear men doubled every object yet twas thought convenient make retreat 
whole matter scouts informed could strength ordered march towards us three regiments foot drawn support horse 
know whether would ventured attack us least foot come whether would put hazard resolved hazard trial drew pass 
retreating looks something like running away especially enemy hand men much ado make retreat pass march flight often looking behind anybody might know would done pressed 
confess heartily ashamed scots coming place posted stood shouted us 
would persuaded lord charged would done heart saw practicable stood gaze two hours time foot come yet offer attack us 
never ashamed life dispirited 
scots gentlemen would come single within shot post time war always accounted challenge single gentleman come exchange pistol nobody would stir last old lieutenant rides meet scotchman came pickeering quarter 
lieutenant brave strong fellow soldier low countries though quality mere soldier preferment conduct 
gallops bravely adversary exchanging pistols lieutenant horse happened killed 
scotchman generously dismounts engages sword fairly masters carries away prisoner think horse blood shed war 
lieutenant name thus conquered english stout old soldier disgrace broke heart 
scotchman indeed used generously treated camp courteously gave another horse set liberty gratis 
man laid heart never would appear army went home country died 
enough party making quite sick indignation cowardice men lord great fret remedy 
durst go retreat confusion enemy must discovered lord resolved keep post possible send king foot 
men ready fight one another messenger last lieutenant twenty dragoons despatched told us afterwards found hundred strong gotten mile place

end worst expedition ever made life 
fight beaten casualty common soldier since enough run away sight enemy neither strike stricken shame profession man done ought show face field unless disadvantages place number make tolerable neither case 
lord holland made another march days hopes retrieve miscarriage enough kept quarters 
though men desert yet upon appearance enemy think fit fight came little honor 
need go seek enemy came noted pitched sight us parties came every day works berwick nobody cared meddle 
posture things stood pacification agreed parties like short truce gave sides breath prepare new war ridiculously managed former 
treaty near conclusion conversation admitted sides went scotch camp satisfy curiosity many english officers also 
confess soldiers made uncouth figure especially highlanders 
oddness barbarity garb arms seemed something remarkable 
generally tall swinging fellows swords extravagantly think insignificantly broad carried great wooden targets large enough cover upper part bodies 
dress antique rest cap heads called bonnet long hanging sleeves behind doublet breeches stockings stuff called plaid striped across red yellow short cloaks 
fellows looked drawn like regiment merry andrews ready bartholomew fair

sir jacob astley made resistance could scots charged much fury also overpowered soon put confusion 
immediately scots made masters newcastle next day durham laid two counties intolerable contributions 
king absolutely ruined among people discontents plain clergy forecast would never embroiled scots till fully brought matters understanding home

king urge venture upon come second battle sits banbury takes town castle two entire regiments foot one troop horse quit parliament service take arms king 
done almost faces better proof victory side could pretend 
banbury marched oxford men saw parliament made great mistake always right leave oxford without garrison 
king caused new regular works drawn round seven royal bastions ravelins works double ditch counterscarp covered way added advantage situation made formidable place time became place arms center affairs king side 
parliament honor field king reaped fruits victory part country submitted 
essex army made best way london ill condition came especially horse 
parliament sensible receiving daily accounts progress made began cool little temper abated first rage voted address peace sent king let know desirous prevent effusion blood bring things accommodation called right understanding 
king particular favor summoned councils war father continuing absent ill began think real grounds fatal issue war 
say began say ever rightly stated matters mind though enough used blood see destruction people sacking towns plundering country yet twas germany among strangers found strange secret unaccountable sadness upon spirits see acting native country 
grieved heart even rout enemies see slaughter even fight hear man cry quarter english moved compassion never used nay sometimes looked men beaten heard soldier cry god shot looked behind see troop fallen 
saw cutting throats friends indeed near relations 
old comrades fellow soldiers germany us us opinions happened differ religion 
part confess much religion time thought religion rightly practiced sides would made us better friends therefore sometimes began think bishops side preachers made religion rather pretence cause war 
thoughts vigorously argued council war marching brentford address treaty peace parliament hand taking parliament handle given us entering negotiation advantage request 
thought king hands opportunity make honorable peace battle edgehill much boasted victory hearten friends sorely weakened army discouraged party effect worse army 
horse particularly ill case foot greatly diminished remainder sickly besides parliament greatly alarmed progress made afterward still fearing king surprising sent earl essex london defend country defeated abandoned left plundered parties overrun places pleasure 
considered whatever soldiers fortune meant war desires suppress exorbitant power party establish king legal rights design destroy constitution government parliament 
therefore thought time peace great many worthy gentlemen army mind master ears hear us war might end 
address peace received king maidenhead whither army advanced majesty returned answer sir peter killegrew desired nothing would wanting part 
upon parliament name commissioners majesty excepting sir john evelyn left sent others desired king appoint residence near london commissioners might wait upon

thus things looked favourable aspect one unlucky action knocked head filled parties implacable animosities hopes peace vanished 
progress king armies always abroad horse ravaging country plundering roundheads 
prince rupert active vigilant party man must fitter general never lying still seldom stayed behind regiment well mounted would always send us extraordinary design hand

prince willing however something caused horse alight serve dragoons broken way enclosures horse beat foot behind hedges rest alighted charged lane leads town 
cast works fired lines regularly considering militia governor encouraging example finding without foot would good done gave drew aylesbury escaped scouring time 
deny flying parties horse committed great spoil among country people sometimes prince gave liberty cruelties king interest still upon country king subjects declarations protested careful seemed contradict protestations declarations served aggravate exasperate common people king enemies made advantages possible crying twice many extravagancies committed 
tis true king naturally abhorred things could restrain men generals absolutely would done 
war side much la volunteer many gentlemen served charge paid whole regiments sometimes also king affairs straiter ordinary men well paid obliged wink excursions upon country though approve 
yet must parts england war hottest never seen ruin depopulation murders barbarities seen even among protestant armies abroad germany foreign parts world 
parliament people seen things abroad would complained 
seen plundering towns provisions drinking beer turning horses fields stacks corn sometimes soldiers would little rude wenches alas count tilly ravages saxony taking leicester storm cried barbarities sacking new brandenburg taking magdeburg leicester people town killed magdeburg scarce left whole town burnt ashes 
seen seventeen eighteen villages fire day people driven away dwellings like herds cattle

parliament party made great outcry attempt base treacherous treaty peace king amused hearkening treaty designed seized upon train artillery first surprised city london parliament 
observed since historians note action contrary laws honor treaties though cessation arms agreed nothing contrary laws war suggest 
unhappy thing king whole nation broke hopes peace occasion bringing scots army upon us readily acknowledge anything dishonourable allow 
though parliament addressed king peace steps taken yet said proposals made either side cessation arms world must allow cases war goes field peace goes cabinet 
war goes admit king designed surprise city parliament custom war allows would done could 
treaty westphalia peace munster ended bloody wars germany precedent 
treaty actually negotiating seven years yet war went vigor rancor imaginable even last 
nay time conclusion news could brought army afterwards king sweden carolus gustavus take city prague surprise therein inestimable booty
