quickly word spread 
men still copies leaflet jimmie distributed found eager readers soon men knew contents debating question use american armies put social revolution foreign country 
questions asked halls congress back home 
senators questioning right sending troops country war never declared senators demanding immediately withdrawn 
news also reached men increased danger 
archangel pleasant place stay especially winter coming fast men disposed grumble pretext iv authorities handling army labored one grievous handicap probably never faced army history 
commander chief army determined policies tried set moral tone kept coming congress making speeches full incendiary reckless utterances calculated set dangerous thoughts buzzing heads soldiers break discipline undermine morale 
president wrote letter political convention declared workers america living economic serfdom declared every people right determine destinies form government without outside interference 
army trying put russians revolt economic serfdom country army see machine built fight man goes takes part work quickly acquires tone one abysmal contempt politicians particularly talking letter writing variety idealists dreamers theorists understand business men fight battles win 
officers old army west pointers bred tradition class rule bones idea special breed obedience law god new officers overwhelming majority came well favourable speech making letter writing rights man 
without enthusiasm idea pacifist secretary war set idealist commander chief 
hesitate vent indignation pacifist secretary gave orders conscientious objectors based upon sentimentalism theory army machine took liberty interpreting orders trimming nonsense 
farther away got office pacifist secretary thorough trimming inevitably became thus producing phenomenon poor jimmie higgins found bewildering policies laid sincere humanitarians liberals washington carried archangel ex detective trained school corruption cruelty 
jimmie higgins understand archangel americans taking orders british french officers wasted breath pacifism sentiment fool ideas wars democracy 
one obscure little runt socialist machinist allowed block world plans setting authority presuming accept literally passages president defiance authority archangel allying traitorous criminal scoundrels trying poison minds american soldiers light flame mutiny among jimmie higgins found strategic position held whole hun army battle chateau thierry found position equal strategic importance line communication allied armies attacking russia threatening cut line force armies retreat v became essential ever discover bolshevik sympathizers stamp propaganda 
hanging jimmie wrists brought forth desired information jimmie put solitary confinement diet bread water another test sincerity conscience 
conscience diet white flour water may right jimmie soon found bad indeed intestinal tract blood stream truth far worse diet water alone 
man lives white flour water days suffers either complete stopping bowels else dysentery blood becomes clogged starch poisons nerves degenerate falls quick victim tuberculosis pernicious anasmia disease prevent ever sound man 
also jimmie received water treatment included fort leavenworth regiment 
necessary prisoners bathed interpreted guards mean stream icy water turned forced stand 
jimmie arms badly injured scrub connor seized rough brush salt rubbed strips skin 
jimmy wriggled away followed hose screamed turned mouth nose fell let cold water run ten fifteen minutes 
jimmie good deal harsh treatment course outcast life never closely concentrated point time 
spirit remained unbroken body gave way mind began give also 
fell victim delusions nightmares haunted sleep lay siege waking hours also thought tortured times hanging chains 
last perkins listening door heard strange cries grunts beast like noises barkings growlings 
called connor grady three stood listening 
god said grady 
dippy 
nutty said connor 
batty said perkins 
idea occurred perhaps shamming easier one emissaries satan pretend devil inside waited bit longer connor coming chain jimmie found gnawing ends fingers 
really serious sent prison surgeon make brief inspection convince jimmie higgins raving madman 
jimmie fancied kind fur bearing animal trap trying gnaw foot escape 
snapped teeth everyone came near knocked senseless straight jacket could got 
vi jimmie higgins last made escape tormentors 
jimmie know anything russian jew kalenkin could tell secret wanted given testing conscience treat kindly succeeded persuading trap 
therefore good beast crawls fours eats food tin platter without using gnawed fingers 
still torturing pains arm joints mind much beast suffers pain moment know going suffer morrow worry 
longer one look pine 
good doggie pat head rubs whines affectionately 
poor mad jimmie higgins never trouble country jimmie friends partisans know story experiences thus lightly dismissed society 
industrial troubles threatening great democracy west appear men women animated fierce blazing bitterness great democracy west marvel state mind unable conceive caused 
rebellious ones heard quoting great democracy words greatest democrat spoken solemn warning slaughter destruction civil war god continue wealth piled bondman two hundred fifty years unrequited toil shall sunk every drop blood drawn lash shall paid another drawn sword said three thousand years ago still must said judgements lord true righteous altogether
