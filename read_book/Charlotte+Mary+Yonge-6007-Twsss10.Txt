still heart like one dear child said lady merrifield 
know way hold together one keep distance apart matter less 
watched dolores father driven away station next morning jane mohun laid hand sister arm said thought made great failure 
lily side failure often success came letters dolores 
seemed first enjoyed journey wrote lady merrifield letter private self father good kind know tell 
little bit mother got think shall like mays 
indeed trying remember advice beginning hating everybody thinking 
aunt phyllis nice indeed sometimes eyes mouth get like mysie voice exactly 
plump roundabout dear tall graceful figure like white lily aunt 
please call nonsense indeed mean aunt phyllis like photograph much 
whole group hung room wish good morning every day never never long live shall love anybody like mysie
