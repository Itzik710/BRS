ground manured dug great observed seed quantity half peck lost one whole crop sowing dry season crop promised well sudden found danger losing enemies several sorts scarce possible keep first goats wild creatures called hares tasting sweetness blade lay night day soon came ate close could get time shoot stalk 
saw remedy making enclosure hedge great deal toil required speed 
however arable land small suited crop got tolerably well fenced three weeks time shooting creatures day time set dog guard night tying stake gate would stand bark night long little time enemies forsook place corn grew strong well began ripen apace 
beasts ruined corn blade birds likely ruin ear going along place see throve saw little crop surrounded fowls know many sorts stood watching till gone 
immediately let fly among always gun sooner shot rose little cloud fowls seen among corn 
touched sensibly foresaw days would devour hopes starved never able raise crop could tell however resolved lose corn possible though watch night day 
first place went among see damage already done found spoiled good deal yet green loss great remainder likely good crop could saved 
staid load gun coming away could easily see thieves sitting upon trees waited till gone away event proved walked gone sooner sight dropt one one corn 
provoked could patience stay till came knowing every grain eat might said peck loaf consequence coming hedge fired killed three 
wished took served serve notorious thieves england viz 
hanged chains terror others 
impossible imagine effect fowls never came corn short forsook part island could never see bird near place long scare crows hung 
glad may sure latter end december second harvest year reaped corn 
sadly put scythe sickle cut could make one well could one broad swords cutlasses saved among arms ship 
however first crop small great difficulty cut short reaped way cut nothing ears carried away great basket made rubbed hands end harvesting found half peck seed near two bushels rice two bushels half barley say guess measure 
however great encouragement foresaw time would please god supply bread yet perplexed neither knew grind make meal corn indeed clean part made meal make bread make yet knew bake things added desire good quantity store secure constant supply resolved taste crop preserve seed next season mean tune employ study hours working accomplish great work providing corn bread 
might truly said worked bread 
little wonderful believe people thought much upon viz 
strange multitude little things necessary providing producing curing dressing making finishing one article bread 
reduced mere state nature found daily discouragement made sensible every hour even got first handful seed corn said came unexpectedly indeed surprise 
first plough turn earth spade shovel dig well conquered making wooden spade observed work wooden manner though cost great many days make yet want iron wore sooner made work harder performed much worse 
however bore content work patience bear badness performance 
corn sown harrow forced go drag great heavy bough tree scratch may called rather rake harrow 
growing grown observed already many things wanted fence secure mow reap cure carry home thrash part chaff save wanted mill grind sieves dress yeast salt make bread oven bake yet things without shall observed corn inestimable comfort advantage said made every thing laborious tedious help neither time much loss divided certain part every day appointed works resolved use none corn bread till greater quantity next six months apply wholly labor invention furnish utensils proper performing operations necessary making corn fit use 
prepare land seed enough sow acre ground 
week work least make spade done sorry one indeed heavy required double labor work however went sowed seed two large flat pieces ground near house could find mind fenced good hedge stakes cut wood set knew would grow one year time knew quick living hedge would want little repair 
work took full three months great part time wet season could go abroad 
within doors rained could go found employment following occasions always observing work diverted talking parrot teaching speak quickly learned know name last speak pretty loud pol first word ever heard spoken island mouth 
therefore work assistant work said great employment upon hands follows long studied means make earthen vessels indeed wanted much knew come however considering heat climate doubt could find clay might botch pot might dried sun hard strong enough bear handling hold thing dry required kept necessary preparing corn meal c thing upon resolved make large could fit stand like jars hold put

however sun baked two dry hard lifted gently set two great wicker baskets made purpose might break pot basket little room spare stuffed full rice barley straw two pots stand always dry thought would hold dry corn perhaps meal corn bruised 
though miscarried much design large pots yet made several smaller things better success little round pots flat dishes pitchers pipkins thing hand turned heat sun baked hard

happened time making pretty large fire cooking meat went put done found broken piece one earthen ware vessels fire burnt hard stone red tile 
agreeably surprised see said certainly might made burn whole would burn broken 
set study order fire make burn pots 
notion kiln potters burn glazing lead though lead placed three large pipkins two three pots pile one upon another placed fire wood round great heap embers 
plied fire fresh fuel round outside upon top till saw pots inside red hot quite observed crack saw clear red let stand heat five six hours till found one though crack melt run sand mixed clay melted violence heat would run glass gone slacked fire gradually till pots began abate red color watching night might let fire abate fast morning three good say handsome pipkins two earthen pots hard burnt could desired one perfectly glazed running sand

joy thing mean nature ever equal mine found made earthen pot would bear fire hardly patience stay till cold set one fire water boil meat admirably well piece kid made good broth though wanted oatmeal several ingredients requisite make good would 
next concern get stone mortar stamp beat corn mill thought arriving perfection art one pair hands 
supply want great loss trades world perfectly unqualified stonecutter whatever neither tools go 
spent many day find great stone big enough cut hollow make fit mortar could find none except solid rock way dig cut indeed rocks island sufficient hardness sandy crumbling stone would neither bear weight heavy pestle would break corn without filling sand great deal time lost searching stone gave resolved look great block hard wood found indeed much easier getting one big strength stir rounded formed outside axe hatchet help fire infinite labor made hollow place indians brazil make canoes 
made great heavy pestle beater wood called iron wood prepared laid next crop corn proposed grind rather pound corn meal make bread 
next difficulty make sieve searce dress meal part bran husk without see possible could bread 
difficult thing even think nothing like necessary thing make mean fine thin canvass stuff searce meal 
full stop many months really know linen none left mere rags goats hair neither knew weave spin known tools work remedy found last recollecting among seamen clothes saved ship neckcloths calico muslin pieces made three small sieves proper enough work thus made shift years afterwards shall show place 
baking part next thing considered make bread came corn first yeast part supplying want concern much oven indeed puzzled 
length found expedient also made earthen vessels broad deep say two feet diameter nine inches deep burned fire done laid wanted bake made great fire upon hearth paved square tiles making burning also call square 
fire wood burned embers live coals drew forward upon hearth cover let lie till hearth hot sweeping away embers set loaf loaves covering earthen pot drew embers round outside pot keep add heat thus well best oven world baked barley loaves became little time good pastry cook bargain made several cakes puddings rice made pies nothing put except flesh fowls goats 
need wondered things took part third year abode observed intervals things new harvest husbandry manage reaped corn season carried home well could laid ear large baskets till time rub floor thrash instrument thrash 
indeed stock corn increasing really wanted build barns bigger wanted place lay increase corn yielded much barley twenty bushels rice much insomuch resolved begin use freely bread quite gone great resolved also see quantity would sufficient whole year sow year 
upon whole found forty bushels barley rice much could consume year resolved sow quantity every year sowed last hopes quantity would fully provide bread c things may sure thoughts ran many times upon prospect land seen side island without secret wishes shore fancying seeing main land inhabited country might find way convey farther perhaps last find means escape

encouraging therefore belief nothing print one feet might truly said start shadow began go abroad went country house milk flock see fear went forward often looked behind ready every lay basket run life would made one thought haunted evil conscience lately terribly frightened indeed 
however went thus two three days seen nothing began little bolder think really nothing imagination could persuade fully till go shore see print foot measure see similitude fitness might assured foot came place first appeared evidently laid boat could possibly shore thereabouts secondly came measure mark foot found foot large great deal

first thing proposed throw enclosures turn tame cattle wild woods lest enemy find frequent island prospect like booty simple thing digging two corn fields lest find grain still prompted frequent island demolish bower tent might see vestiges habitation prompted look farther order find persons inhabiting 
subject first night cogitataions come home apprehensions run mind fresh upon head full vapors 
thus fear danger ten thousand times terrifying danger apparent eyes find burthen anxiety greater much evil anxious worse relief trouble resignation used practice hoped 
looked thought like saul complained philistines upon god forsaken take due ways compose mind crying god distress resting upon providence done defense deliverance done least cheerfully supported new surprise perhaps carried resolution 
confusion thoughts kept awake night morning fell asleep amusement mind tired spirits exhausted slept soundly waked much better composed ever 
began think sedately upon utmost debate concluded island exceeding pleasant fruitful farther main land seen entirely abandoned might imagine although stated inhabitants lived spot yet might sometimes come boats shore either design perhaps never driven cross winds might come place lived fifteen years met least shadow figure people yet time driven probable went away soon ever could seeing never thought fit fix upon occasion could suggest danger casual accidental landing straggling people main likely driven hither wills made stay went possible speed seldom staying one night shore lest help tides daylight back therefore nothing consider safe retreat case see savages land upon spot 
began sorely repent dug cave large bring door door said came beyond fortification joined rock upon maturely considering therefore resolved draw second fortification manner semi circle distance wall planted double row trees twelve years made mention trees planted thick wanted piles driven might thicker stronger wall would soon finished double wall outer wall thickened pieces timber old cables every thing could think make strong seven little holes big might put arm 
inside thickened wall ten feet thick continually bringing earth cave laying foot wall walking upon seven holes contrived plant muskets took notice got seven shore ship planted like cannon fitted frames held like carriage could fire seven guns two minutes time wall many weary month finishing yet never thought safe till done 
done stuck ground without wall great length every way full stakes sticks osier like wood found apt grow could well stand insomuch believe might set near twenty thousand leaving pretty large space wall might room see enemy might shelter young trees attempted approach outer wall 
thus two years time thick grove five six years time wood dwelling growing monstrous thick strong indeed perfectly impassable men kind soever would ever imagine thing beyond much less habitation 
way proposed go left avenue setting two ladders one part rock low broke left room place another ladder upon two ladders taken man living could come without mischief come still outside outer wall 
thus took measures human prudence could suggest preservation seen length altogether without reason though foresaw nothing time mere fear suggested 
altogether careless affairs great concern upon little herd goats ready supply every occasion began sufficient without expense powder shot also without fatigue hunting wild ones loth lose advantage nurse 
purpose long consideration could think two ways preserve one find another convenient place dig cave ground drive every night enclose two three little bits land remote one another much concealed could might keep half dozen young goats place disaster happened flock general might able raise little trouble time though would require great deal time labor thought rational design 
accordingly spent time find retired parts island pitched upon one private indeed heart could wish little damp piece ground middle hollow thick woods observed almost lost endeavoring come back way eastern part island 
found clear piece land near three acres surrounded woods almost enclosure nature least want near much labor make pieces ground worked hard 
immediately went work piece ground less month time fenced round flock herd call please wild first might supposed well enough secured without farther delay removed ten young goats two goats piece continued perfect fence till made secure however leisure took time great deal 
labor expense purely apprehensions account print man foot seen yet never saw human creature come near island lived two years uneasiness indeed made life much less comfortable may well imagined know live constant snare fear man 
must observe grief discomposure mind great impressions also upon religious part thoughts dread terror falling hands savages cannibals lay upon spirits seldom found due temper application maker least sedate calmness resignation soul wont rather prayed god great affliction pressure mind surrounded danger expectation every night murdered devoured morning must testify experience temper peace thankfulness love affection much proper frame prayer terror discomposure dread mischief impending man fit comforting performance duty praying god repentance sick bed discomposures affect mind others body discomposure mind must necessarily great disability body much greater praying god properly act mind body 
go thus secured one part little living stock went whole island searching another private place make another deposit wandering west point island ever done yet looking sea thought saw boat upon sea great distance 
found perspective glass two one seamen chests saved ship remote could tell make though looked till eyes able hold look longer whether boat know descended hill could see gave resolved go without perspective glass pocket 
come hill end island indeed never presently convinced seeing print man foot strange thing island imagined special providence cast upon side island savages never came easily known nothing frequent canoes main happened little far sea shoot side island harbor likewise often met fought canoes victors taken prisoners would bring shore according dreadful customs cannibals would kill eat hereafter 
come hill shore said sw point island perfectly confounded amazed possible express horror mind seeing shore spread skulls hands feet bones human bodies particularly observed place fire made circle dug earth like cock pit supposed savage wretches sat inhuman feastings upon bodies fellow creatures

frame thankfulness went home castle began much easier safety circumstances ever observed wretches never came island search could get perhaps seeking wanting expecting thing often doubt covered woody part without finding thing purpose 
knew almost eighteen years never saw least footsteps human creature might eighteen years entirely concealed discover manner occasion business keep entirely concealed unless found better sort creatures cannibals make known 
yet entertained abhorrence savage wretches speaking wretched inhuman custom devouring eating one another continued pensive sad kept close within circle almost two years say circle mean three plantations viz 
castle country seat called bower enclosure woods look use enclosure goats aversion nature gave hellish wretches fearful seeing seeing devil 
much go look boat time began rather think making another could think ever making attempts bring boat round island lest meet creatures sea happened fallen hands knew would lot 
time however satisfaction danger discovered people began wear uneasiness began live composed manner difference used caution kept eyes lest happen seen particularly cautious firing gun lest island happen hear 
therefore good providence furnished tame breed goats need hunt woods shoot catch traps snares done two years believe never fired gun though never went without saved three pistols ship always carried least two sticking goat skin belt 
also furbished one great cutlasses ship made belt hang also formidable fellow look went abroad add former description particular two pistols great broad sword hanging side belt without scabbard 
things going thus said time seemed excepting cautions reduced former calm sedate way living 
things tended show far condition miserable compared others nay many particulars life might pleased god made lot 
put upon reflecting little repining would among mankind condition life people would rather compare condition worse order thankful always comparing better assist murmurings complainings 
present condition really many things wanted indeed thought frights savage wretches concern preservation taken edge invention conveniences dropped good design bent thoughts much upon try could make barley malt try brew beer 
really whimsical thought reproved often simplicity presently saw would want several things necessary making beer would impossible supply first casks preserve thing observed already could never compass though spent many days weeks nay months attempting purpose 
next place hops make keep yeast make work copper kettle make boil yet things wanting verily believe frights terrors savages intervened undertaken perhaps brought pass seldom gave thing without accomplishing head begin 
invention ran quite another way night day could think nothing might destroy monsters cruel bloody entertainment possible save victim bring hither destroy 
would take larger volume whole work intended set contrivances hatched rather brooded upon thoughts destroying creatures least frightening prevent coming hither abortive nothing could possible take effect unless could one man among perhaps might twenty thirty together darts bows arrows could shoot true mark could gun sometimes thought digging hole place made fire putting five six pounds gunpowder kindled fire would consequently take fire blow near first place unwilling waste much powder upon store within quantity one barrel neither could sure going certain time might surprise best would little blow fire ears fright sufficient make forsake place laid aside proposed would place ambush convenient place three guns double loaded middle bloody ceremony let fly sure kill wound perhaps two three every shot falling upon three pistols sword made doubt twenty kill 
fancy pleased thoughts weeks full often dreamed sometimes going let fly sleep 
went far imagination employed several days find proper places put ambuscade said watch went frequently place grown familiar mind thus filled thoughts revenge bloody putting twenty thirty sword may call horror place signals barbarous wretches devouring one another abetted malice 
well length found place side hill satisfied might securely wait till saw boats coming might even would ready come shore convey unseen thickets trees one hollow large enough conceal entirely might sit observe bloody doings take full aim heads close together would next impossible miss shot could fail wounding three four first shot

two muskets loaded brace slugs four five smaller bullets size pistol bullets fowling piece loaded near handful swan shot largest size also loaded pistols four bullets posture well provided ammunition second third charge prepared expedition 
thus laid scheme design imagination put practice continually made tour every morning top hill castle called three miles see could observe boats upon sea coming near island standing towards began tire hard duty two three months constantly kept watch came always back without discovery time least appearance near shore whole ocean far eyes glasses could reach every way

far people offenders right engage quarrel blood shed promiscuously upon one another debated often thus know god judges particular case certain people commit crime consciences reproving light reproaching know offence commit defiance divine justice almost sins commit 
think crime kill captive taken war kill ox eat human flesh eat mutton 
considered little followed necessarily certainly wrong people murderers sense condemned thoughts christians murderers often put death prisoners taken battle frequently upon many occasions put whole troops men sword without giving quarter though threw arms submitted 
next place occurred although usage gave one another thus brutish inhuman yet really nothing people done injury attempted saw necessary immediate preservation fall upon something might said yet power really knowledge consequently design upon therefore could fall upon would justify conduct spaniards barbarities practiced america destroyed millions people however idolaters barbarians several bloody barbarous rites customs sacrificing human bodies idols yet spaniards innocent people rooting country spoken utmost abhorrence detestation even spaniards time christian nations europe mere butchery bloody unnatural piece cruelty unjustifiable either god man name spaniard reckoned frightful terrible people humanity christian compassion kingdom spain particularly eminent produce race men without principles tenderness common bowels pity miserable reckoned mark generous temper mind
