chapter xxviii tells bellew left dapplemere dawn far east gray streak marked advent another day upon things solemn hush great awful stillness like stillness death 
earth place gloom mist spectral shadows writhed twisted flitted frowning heaven gloom came breath sharp damp exceeding chill 
therefore bellew gazed frowning heaven gloom earth ever moving misty shapes shivered involuntarily 
another hour would day day gates arcadia would open departure must go forth become wanderer going fro world course run 
yet worth lived one golden month wanderings needs must carry memory taught deep high wide infinitely far reaching thing called love may really 
porges dear quaint small porges heaven could ever find utter faith pure unaffected loyalty devotion throbbed within small warm heart could ever bid good bye loving eager little small porges miss priscilla strong gentle sergeant peterday sturdy adam prudence rosy cheeked maids 
well suited wonderful arcadia yes indeed place must go back every day matter fact world could ever say good bye faithful loving small porges far east gray streak brightened broadened already tinged faint pink deepened deepened watched 
bellew seen glory many sun rise divers wild places earth hitherto always felt deep within responsive thrill exhilaration hope new born joyful expectation great unknown future 
watched varying hues pink scarlet saffron gold gloomy brow sombre eyes 
presently black bird lived apple tree beneath window tree inquisitive turn mind black bird fellow opening drowsy eye must needs give vent croak hoarse feeble apparently yawned prodigiously stretched wing leg tried couple notes hesitating tentative sort fashion shook repeated two notes tried three found mellower waiting world justly expected grew confident tried four tried five grew perfectly assured burst forth full golden melody morning song 
bellew leaning casement first bright beams rising sun gilded top leaves tree thus apostrophised unseen singer suppose piping away tree old fellow long arcadia faded life 
well natural perfectly right course may perhaps stop listen 
somehow could manage compose song memory evening gone evening happens sitting idle watching moon rise upland yonder time could manage remind thank 
good bye old fellow saying bellew turned window took certain bulging strapped portmanteau black bird evidently hearkened request much grave attention fell singing gloriously ever 
meanwhile bellew descended great wide stair soft foot cautious step yet pausing look towards certain closed door presently let quietly dawn 
dew sparkled grass hung glittering jewels every leaf twig shining drop would fall upon passed like great tear 
reached orchard rose sun majesty filling world splendor coming whose kindly beams skulking mists shadows shrank affrighted fled utterly away 
morning king arthur wore grandest robes state mantle green thick sewn myriad flaming gems different looked dark shrouded giant lately conspirator 
two 
yet perhaps reason bellew paused lay hand upon mighty rugged hole turned looked back house dapplemere 
truly never old house seemed beautiful quaint peaceful 
every stone beam become familiar looked seemed find individuality lattices seemed look back like many wistful eyes 
therefore george bellew american citizen millionaire traveller explorer lover sighed turned away sighed strode green golden morning resolutely looked back

anthea sat still drooping head vacant eyes 
done irrevocable step taken given promise chosen course must follow end 
arcadia would seem promise still sacred thing 
lifting eyes encountered smiling cavalier mantel 
looked stretched arms sudden yearning gesture oh whispered picture like 
chapter xxxi last properly longest book benighted days men went abroad cased steel upon slight provocation wont smite axes clubs buffet skewer spears lances swords divers barbarous engines yet dark doughty age ignorant though smug maxims excellent moralities happily blessed even unhallowed day solemn tread policeman foot unknown evolved code rules whereby govern life conduct 
amongst tacitly agreed upon understood spoken promise pledge held sacred thing broke faith committed cardinal sins 
indeed laws simple easily understood well calculated govern man conduct fellow 
day ablaze learning culture veneered fine civilization laws complex beyond knowing expression man regulates conduct virtuous honest law compels 
age money therefore irreverent age also age respectability large r policeman bludgeon 
arcadia old world place life follows even simple course money scarce roguery old law still holds promise given sacred obligation set aside 
even black bird lived inquisitive apple tree understood aware born grown feathers 
therefore though sure spoken promise signed bond affixed mark agreement still nevertheless borne mind certain request preferred day young 
thus constancy purpose worthy imitation given mind thought composition song new theme 
applied industriously day long sun began set last corked every note every quaver trill perched upon look branch kept bold bright eye turned toward certain rustic seat hard uttering melodious note two every pure impatience 
presently sure enough spied waited tall long limbed supple waisted creature whose skin pink gold like peaches apricots garden soft little rings hair would made excellent lining nest 
strictly utilitarian point view often admired hair black bird fellow passed fro among flowers paused look listen song even sometimes speak sweet low voice 
day seemed forgotten altogether even glance way indeed walked bent head seemed keep eyes always upon ground 
therefore black bird hopped little along branch peered look first one round eye sank upon seat near leaned head wearily great tree behind 
thus saw upon pint gold cheek something shone twinkled like drop dew 
black bird wondered inclined curious sturdily repressed weakness audience seated waiting expectation begin 
without ado settled upon bough lifted head stretched throat yellow bill poured forth flood golden melody burst forth song memory 
song full passionate entreaty tender pleading haunting sweetness listened bright drop quivering upon lashes fell succeeded another another 
attempt check wipe away sat listened heavy head pillowed great tree blackbird glancing every critical eye mark effect particularly difficult passage piped surely never done listener proud face sank lower lower last hidden hands 
seeing black bird like true artist fearing anti climax presently ended song long drawn plaintive note 
anthea sat proud head bowed low long retired night 
sun went shadows came creeping stealthily moon began rise big yellow land anthea still sat head resting wearily king arthur watching deepening shadows roused small porges hand upon voice saying believe crying auntie anthea alone listening black bird dear never heard sing quite beautifully

crossed stile presently came brook impertinent brook world 
upon little rustic bridge stopped look sparkle water listen merry voice 
yes indeed night impertinent ever laughing chuckling among hollows whispering scandalously shadows 
seemed anthea laughing mocking taunting future 
amid laughter sobs tearful murmurs seemed prophetic voice old nannie force ye shall wooed force ye shall wed man strong enough bears tiger mark upon tiger mark alas far truth poor old nannie dreams dreams anthea nearly believed twice 
foolish yet even anthea leaning gurgling waters passed mind started sound heavy foot fall planking bridge behind instant encircled powerful arm caught strong embrace swung feet borne away shadows little copse 
dark wood knew instinctively whose arms held close carried easily away shadows wood away haunting hopeless dread future seemed chance hope escape 
knowing made struggle uttered word 
trees thinned lashes saw face thick black brows drawn together close set lips grim prominence strong square chin 
road lifted automobile sprung beside gliding swift ever swifter shadows trees 
still neither spoke looked leaned away cushions kept frowning eyes fixed upon road head ever great car flew onward faster faster yet fast beating heart wherein shame anger fear another feeling strove fought mastery
