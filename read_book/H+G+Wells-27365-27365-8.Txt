must insist said clergyman five pounds 
mrs cave took apologise husband explaining sometimes little odd two customers left couple prepared free discussion incident bearings 
mrs cave talked husband singular directness 
poor little man quivering emotion muddled stories maintaining one hand another customer view asserting crystal honestly worth ten guineas 
ask five pounds said wife 
let manage business way said mr cave 
mr cave living step daughter step son supper night transaction discussed 
none high opinion mr cave business methods action seemed culminating folly 
opinion refused crystal said step son loose limbed lout eighteen 
five pounds said step daughter argumentative young woman six twenty 
mr cave answers wretched could mumble weak assertions knew business best 
drove half eaten supper shop close night ears aflame tears vexation behind spectacles 
left crystal window long folly trouble closest mind 
time could see way evading sale 
supper step daughter step son smartened went wife retired upstairs reflect upon business aspects crystal little sugar lemon forth hot water 
mr cave went shop stayed late ostensibly make ornamental rockeries goldfish cases really private purpose better explained later 
next day mrs cave found crystal removed window lying behind second hand books angling

mr cave anything absent minded usual uncommonly irritable withal 
afternoon wife taking customary sleep removed crystal window

mr cave stoutly denied knowledge fate freely offering bedabbled affidavit matter last worked point accusing first wife step son taken view private sale 
began exceedingly acrimonious emotional discussion ended mrs cave peculiar nervous condition midway hysterics amuck caused step son half hour late furniture establishment afternoon 
mr cave took refuge wife emotions shop 
evening matter resumed less passion judicial spirit presidency step daughter 
supper passed unhappily culminated painful scene 
mr cave gave way last extreme exasperation went banging front door violently 
rest family discussed freedom absence warranted hunted house garret cellar hoping light upon crystal 
next day two customers called 
received mrs cave almost tears 
transpired one could imagine stood cave various times married pilgrimage also gave garbled account disappearance 
clergyman oriental laughed silently one another said extraordinary 
mrs cave seemed disposed give complete history life made leave shop 
thereupon mrs cave still clinging hope asked clergyman address could get anything cave might communicate 
address duly given apparently afterwards mislaid 
mrs cave remember nothing 
evening day caves seem exhausted emotions mr cave afternoon supped gloomy isolation contrasted pleasantly impassioned controversy previous days 
time matters badly strained cave household neither crystal customer reappeared 
without mincing matter must admit mr cave liar 
knew perfectly well crystal 
rooms mr jacoby wace assistant demonstrator st catherine hospital westbourne street 
stood sideboard partially covered black velvet cloth beside decanter american whisky 
mr wace indeed particulars upon narrative based derived 
cave taken thing hospital hidden dog fish sack pressed young investigator keep 
mr wace little dubious first 
relationship cave peculiar 
taste singular characters invited old man smoke drink rooms unfold rather amusing views life general wife particular 
mr wace encountered mrs cave occasions mr cave home attend 
knew constant interference cave subjected weighed story judicially decided give crystal refuge 
mr cave promised explain reasons remarkable affection crystal fully later occasion spoke distinctly seeing visions therein 
called mr wace evening 
told complicated story 
crystal said come possession oddments forced sale another curiosity dealer effects knowing value might ticketed ten shillings 
hung upon hands price months thinking reducing figure made singular discovery 
time health bad must borne mind throughout experience physical condition one ebb considerable distress reason negligence positive ill treatment even received wife step children 
wife vain extravagant unfeeling growing taste private drinking step daughter mean reaching step son conceived violent dislike lost chance showing 
requirements business pressed heavily upon mr wace think altogether free occasional intemperance 
begun life comfortable position man fair education suffered weeks stretch melancholia insomnia 
afraid disturb family would slip quietly wife side thoughts became intolerable wander house 
three clock one morning late august chance directed shop 
dirty little place impenetrably black except one spot perceived unusual glow light 
approaching discovered crystal egg standing corner counter towards window 
thin ray smote crack shutters impinged upon object seemed fill entire interior 
occurred mr cave accordance laws optics known younger days 
could understand rays refracted crystal coming focus interior diffusion jarred physical conceptions 
approached crystal nearly peering round transient revival scientific curiosity youth determined choice calling 
surprised find light steady writhing within substance egg though object hollow sphere luminous vapor 
moving get different points view suddenly found come ray crystal none less remained luminous 
greatly astonished lifted light ray carried darkest part shop 
remained bright four five minutes slowly faded went 
placed thin streak daylight luminousness almost immediately restored 
far least mr wace able verify remarkable story mr cave 
repeatedly held crystal ray light less diameter one millimetre 
perfect darkness could produced velvet wrapping crystal undoubtedly appear faintly phosphorescent 
would seem however luminousness exceptional sort equally visible eyes mr harbinger whose name familiar scientific reader connection pasteur institute quite unable see light whatever 
mr wace capacity appreciation comparison inferior mr cave even mr cave power varied considerably vision vivid states extreme weakness fatigue 
outset light crystal exercised curious fascination upon mr cave 
says loneliness soul volume pathetic writing could told human curious observations 
seems living atmosphere petty spite admit existence pleasure would risk loss 
found dawn advanced amount diffused light increased crystal became appearance non luminous 
time unable see anything except night time dark corners shop 
use old velvet cloth used background collection minerals occurred doubling putting head hands able get sight luminous movement within crystal even daytime 
cautious lest thus discovered wife practiced occupation afternoons asleep upstairs circumspectly hollow counter 
one day turning crystal hands saw something 
came went like flash gave impression object moment opened view wide spacious strange country turning light faded see vision 
would tedious unnecessary state phases mr cave discovery point 
suffice effect crystal peered angle degrees direction illuminating ray gave clear consistent picture wide peculiar countryside 
dream like produced definite impression reality better light real solid seemed 
moving picture say certain objects moved slowly orderly manner like real things according direction lighting vision changed picture changed also 
must indeed like looking oval glass view turning glass get different aspects 
mr cave statements mr wace assures extremely circumstantial entirely free emotional quality taints hallucinatory impressions 
must remembered efforts mr wace see similar clarity faint opalescence crystal wholly unsuccessful try would 
difference intensity impressions received two men great quite conceivable view mr cave mere blurred nebulosity mr wace 
view mr cave described invariably extensive plain seemed always looking considerable height tower mast 
east west plain bounded remote distance vast reddish cliffs reminded seen picture picture mr wace unable ascertain 
cliffs passed north south could tell points compass stars visible night receding almost illimitable perspective fading mists distance met 
nearer eastern set cliffs occasion first vision sun rising black sunlight pale shadow appeared multitude soaring forms mr cave regarded birds 
vast range buildings spread seemed looking upon approached blurred refracted edge picture became indistinct 
also trees curious shape coloring deep mossy green exquisite gray beside wide shining canal 
something great brilliantly colored flew across picture 
first time mr cave saw pictures saw flashes hands shook head moved vision came went grew foggy indistinct 
first greatest difficulty finding picture direction lost 
next clear vision came week first interval yielded nothing tantalising glimpses useful experience showed view length valley 
view different curious persuasion subsequent observations abundantly confirmed regarding strange world exactly spot although looking different direction 
long fa ade great building whose roof looked upon receding perspective 
recognized roof 
front fa ade terrace massive proportions extraordinary length middle terrace certain intervals stood huge graceful masts bearing small shiny objects reflected setting sun 
import small objects occur mr cave time describing scene mr wace 
terrace overhung thicket luxuriant graceful vegetation beyond wide grassy lawn certain broad creatures form like beetles enormously larger reposed 
beyond richly decorated causeway pinkish stone beyond lined dense red weeds passing valley exactly parallel distant cliffs broad mirror like expanse water 
air seemed full squadrons great birds man oe uvring stately curves across river multitude splendid buildings richly colored glittering metallic tracery facets among forest moss like lichenous trees 
suddenly something flapped repeatedly across vision like fluttering jewelled fan beating wing face rather upper part face large eyes came close side crystal 
mr cave startled impressed absolute reality eyes drew head back crystal look behind 
become absorbed watching quite surprised find cool darkness little shop familiar odour methyl mustiness decay 
blinked glowing crystal faded went 
first general impressions mr cave 
story curiously direct circumstantial 
outset valley first flashed momentarily senses imagination strangely affected began appreciate details scene saw wonder rose point passion 
went business listless distraught thinking time able return watching 
weeks first sight valley came two customers stress excitement offer narrow escape crystal sale already told 
thing mr cave secret remained mere wonder thing creep covertly peep child might peep upon forbidden garden 
mr wace young scientific investigator particularly lucid consecutive habit mind 
directly crystal story came satisfied seeing phosphorescence eyes really certain evidence mr cave statements proceeded develop matter systematically 
mr cave eager come feast eyes wonderland saw came every night half past eight half past ten sometimes mr wace absence day 
sunday afternoons also came 
outset mr wace made copious notes due scientific method relation direction initiating ray entered crystal orientation picture proved 
covering crystal box perforated small aperture admit exciting ray substituting black holland buff blinds greatly improved conditions observations little able survey valley direction desired 
cleared way may give brief account visionary world within crystal 
things cases seen mr cave method working invariably watch crystal report saw mr wace science student learned trick writing dark wrote brief note report 
crystal faded put box proper position electric light turned 
mr wace asked questions suggested observations clear difficult points 
nothing indeed could less visionary matter fact 
attention mr cave speedily directed bird like creatures seen abundantly present earlier visions 
first impression soon corrected considered time might represent diurnal species bat 
thought grotesquely enough might cherubs 
heads round curiously human eyes one startled second observation 
broad silvery wings feathered glistening almost brilliantly new killed fish subtle play color wings built plan bird wing bat mr wace learned supported curved ribs radiating body 
sort butterfly wing curved ribs seems best express appearance 
body small fitted two bunches prehensile organs like long tentacles immediately mouth 
incredible appeared mr wace persuasion last became irresistible creatures owned great quasi human buildings magnificent garden made broad valley splendid 
mr cave perceived buildings peculiarities doors great circular windows opened freely gave creatures egress entrance 
would alight upon tentacles fold wings smallness almost rod like hop interior 
among multitude smaller winged creatures like great dragon flies moths flying beetles across greensward brilliantly colored gigantic ground beetles crawled lazily fro 
moreover causeways terraces large headed creatures similar greater winged flies wingless visible hopping busily upon hand like tangle tentacles 
allusion already made glittering objects upon masts stood upon terrace nearer building 
dawned upon mr cave regarding one masts fixedly one particularly vivid day glittering object crystal exactly like peered 
still careful scrutiny convinced one vista nearly twenty carried similar object 
occasionally one large flying creatures would flutter one folding wings coiling number tentacles mast would regard crystal fixedly space sometimes long fifteen minutes 
series observations made suggestion mr wace convinced watchers far visionary world concerned crystal peered actually stood summit endmost mast terrace one occasion least one inhabitants world looked mr cave face making observations 
much essential facts singular story 
unless dismiss ingenious fabrication mr wace believe one two things either mr cave crystal two worlds carried one remained stationary seems altogether absurd else peculiar relation sympathy another exactly similar crystal world seen interior one world suitable conditions visible observer corresponding crystal world vice versa 
present indeed know way two crystals could come en rapport nowadays know enough understand thing altogether impossible 
view crystals en rapport supposition occurred mr wace least seems extremely plausible world also alert intelligence mr wace speedily threw light 
sunset sky darkened rapidly brief twilight interval indeed stars shone 
recognisably see arranged constellations 
mr cave recognized bear pleiades aldebaran sirius world must somewhere solar system utmost hundreds millions miles 
following clue mr wace learned midnight sky darker blue even midwinter sky sun seemed little smaller 
two small moons like moon smaller quite differently marked one moved rapidly motion clearly visible one regarded 
moons never high sky vanished rose every time revolved eclipsed near primary planet 
answers quite completely although mr cave know must condition things mars 
indeed seems exceedingly plausible conclusion peering crystal mr cave actually see planet mars inhabitants 
case evening star shone brilliantly sky distant vision neither less familiar earth 
time martians martians seem known mr cave inspection 
twice one would come peer go away shortly mast though vision unsatisfactory 
time mr cave able watch proceedings winged people without disturbed attentions although report necessarily vague fragmentary nevertheless suggestive 
imagine impression humanity martian observer would get difficult process preparation considerable fatigue eyes able peer london steeple st martin church stretches longest four minutes time 
mr cave unable ascertain winged martians martians hopped causeways terraces latter could put wings 
several times saw certain clumsy bipeds dimly suggestive apes white partially translucent feeding among certain lichenous trees fled one hopping round headed martians 
latter caught one tentacles picture faded suddenly left mr cave tantalisingly dark 
another occasion vast thing mr cave thought first gigantic insect appeared advancing along causeway beside canal extraordinary rapidity 
drew nearer mr cave perceived mechanism shining metals extraordinary complexity 
looked passed sight 
time mr wace aspired attract attention martians next time strange eyes one appeared close crystal mr cave cried sprang away immediately turned light began gesticulate manner suggestive signalling 
last mr cave examined crystal martian departed 
thus far observations progressed early november mr cave feeling suspicions family crystal allayed began take fro order occasion arose daytime night might comfort fast becoming real thing existence 
december mr wace work connection forthcoming examination became heavy sittings reluctantly suspended week ten eleven days quite sure saw nothing cave 
grew anxious resume investigations stress seasonal labors abated went seven dials 
corner noticed shutter bird fancier window another cobbler mr cave shop closed 
rapped door opened step son black 
called mrs cave mr wace could observe cheap ample widow weeds imposing pattern 
without great surprise mr wace learned cave dead already buried 
tears voice little thick 
returned highgate 
mind seemed occupied prospects honorable details obsequies mr wace last able learn particulars cave death 
found dead shop early morning day last visit mr wace crystal clasped stone cold hands 
face smiling said mrs cave velvet cloth minerals lay floor feet 
must dead five six hours found 
came great shock wace began reproach bitterly neglected plain symptoms old man ill health 
chief thought crystal 
approached topic gingerly manner knew mrs cave peculiarities 
dumbfoundered learn sold 
mrs cave first impulse directly cave body taken upstairs write mad clergyman offered five pounds crystal informing recovery violent hunt daughter joined convinced loss address 
without means required mourn bury cave elaborate style dignity old seven dials inhabitant demands appealed friendly fellow tradesman great portland street 
kindly taken portion stock valuation 
valuation crystal egg included one lots 
mr wace suitable consolatory observations little handedly proffered perhaps hurried great portland street 
learned crystal egg already sold tall dark man gray 
material facts curious least suggestive story come abruptly end 
great portland street dealer know tall dark man gray observed sufficient attention describe minutely 
even know way person gone leaving shop 
time mr wace remained shop trying dealer patience hopeless questions venting exasperation 
last realizing abruptly whole thing passed hands vanished like vision night returned rooms little astonished find notes made still tangible visible upon untidy table 
annoyance disappointment naturally great 
made second call equally ineffectual upon great portland street dealer resorted advertisements periodicals likely come hands bric brac collector 
also wrote letters daily chronicle nature periodicals suspecting hoax asked reconsider action printed advised strange story unfortunately bare supporting evidence might imperil reputation investigator 
moreover calls proper work urgent 
month save occasional reminder certain dealers reluctantly abandon quest crystal egg day remains undiscovered 
occasionally however tells quite believe bursts zeal abandons urgent occupation resumes search 
whether remain lost ever material origin things equally speculative present time 
present purchaser collector one would expected enquiries mr wace reached dealers 
able discover mr cave clergyman oriental rev james parker young prince bosso kuni java 
obliged certain particulars 
object prince simply curiosity extravagance 
eager buy cave oddly reluctant sell 
possible buyer second instance simply casual purchaser collector crystal egg know may present moment within mile decorating drawing room serving paper weight remarkable functions unknown 
indeed partly idea possibility thrown narrative form give chance read ordinary consumer fiction 
ideas matter practically identical mr wace 
believe crystal mast mars crystal egg mr cave physical present quite inexplicable way en rapport believe terrestrial crystal must possibly remote date sent hither planet order give martians near view affairs
