conclusion chapter midshipman first day term considered cheerful occasion 
boys arrive previous evening much tell full chatter laughter great upon night preceding breaking 
morning however changed 
take places desks open books dull heavy feeling takes possession boys full consciousness beginning another half year work weighs heavily minds 
true enough half year play matches rivalry excitement 
present long routine lessons prominent minds lads sitting long benches king school canterbury

moment conversation boys abruptly broken archer called class master 
archer said looking papers desk verses disgraceful 
holiday tasks sent appears worst 
sorry sir jack archer said really tried hard somehow quantities never come right 
know call trying hard archer utterly impossible taken trouble look words gradus could made mistakes 
know sir jack answered 
exercises translations sort thing well enough always break verses see good except fellows want write latin verses tombstones 
nothing master said going discuss utility verses 
shall report dr wallace work holidays play hours 
jack retired seat next ten minutes indulged diatribe classical learning general hexameters pentameters particular 
presently one sixth form came jack sitting archer dr wallace wants 
oh lord jack groaned seen marshall get seat 
suppose written report beastly verses 
greeting dr wallace however different nature anticipated 
archer said received note father 
go home 
jack archer opened eyes astonishment 
hour half since started harbledown mile distant school 
father said nothing breakfast earth could want home mechanical yes sir returned place gathered books hastily together fastening strap soon way home rapid trot 
overtook ere long servant brought note old soldier major archer servant army 
matter jones one ill home sir one ill knows 
major called study told take note dr wallace course asked master questions 
jack said suppose jones 
suppose ask questions told take letter straight man moon 
wonder mean 
continuing run soon left steady going old soldier far behind 
high street great gate along wide straggling street beyond open country across fields harbledown 
jack never paused till hot panting entered gate 
father elder brother seen coming across fields standing porch 
hurrah jack latter shouted going first 
going first jack gasped 
earth mean harry come parlor jack father said shall hear 
mother two sisters sitting 
dear boy former said rising throwing arms round neck sudden indeed 
sudden mother sudden jack asked 
noticing tear mother cheek went beastly verses subject upon mind prominent 

even wallace took head make row would time 
mother sit jack father said 
know boy always said would like go sea 
interest way six months ago wrote nephew charles know first lieutenant navy asked thought could get midshipman berth 
wrote back say present half pay feared would long time afloat ships commission much interest 
appointed might able get berth board ship 
seem hopeful thought better say nothing 
however morning started school postman brought letter saying owing threatening state affairs east number ships rapidly put commission appointed falcon seen captain latter happened old friend one particular wished oblige kindly asked admiralty midshipman appointment 
course obtained 
falcon fitted haste join 
shall take portsmouth morrow 
jack much delighted surprised able speak first 
minute two recovered breath uttered loud hurrah delight gave vent feelings exuberantly kissing mother sisters 
glorious said 
think blown verses midshipman majesty service 
hardly believe true 
oh father wished go sea never said much thought like think getting quite given hope time seems chance row 
father heard say something dispute russia never gave much attention 
cause dispute trumpery enough wholly insufficient cause war two great nations 
began squabble holy places jerusalem rights greek latin pilgrims respectively 
got either latin greek pilgrims jack asked 
thought quite bothered enough latin greek verses without anything pilgrims 
besides know latins greeks much 
major archer smiled 
latin pilgrims members countries profess roman catholic religion greeks profess religion greek church 
say present case principally russians 
years squabbles swelling sometimes serious tumults pilgrims creeds matter generally complicated interference turkish authorities 
russian government endeavoring obtain turkey protectorate christians dominions france leading catholic country naturally objects 
however pretext 
real fact russia centuries casting longing eye upon turkey thinks time arrived carry ambitious designs 
always policy upon hand sustain turkey 
large interests mediterranean considerable trade levant russia extend dominion constantinople position would seriously menaced 
moreover perhaps principal point absolutely necessary us future dominant east mediterranean 
egypt rapidly becoming highway india many men think future trade great dependency flow valley euphrates 
consequently necessary prevent russia cost obtaining footing south black sea 
think father really war inclined think jack although popular opinion 
long england talking iniquity war believe emperor nicholas persuaded fight price 
sure wholly mistaken 
long probability war people england quietly permitted cheese paring politicians govern us cut army navy point hardly said army 
convinced people england heart warlike old 
nations done fighting roughly speaking wars always popular 
people large become convinced honor interest england stake go war politicians power follow popular current give way men 
present however general idea demonstration upon part england france sufficient prevent russia taking steps 
think russia gone far draw back 
russia country czars nominally powerful point fact much bound sovereigns follow wishes country 
conquest constantinople long dream every russian czar held hopes dream realized scarcely like draw back 
surely father harry archer said russia think match england france united 
know boy 
russia enormous population far larger england france united 
every man highest lowest disposal czar scarcely limit force capable putting field 
russia fought since days napoleon days russian troops showed good europe 
borodino smolensko barely defeated inflicting enormous losses emperor army end annihilated largest army even napoleon ever got together may well think fighting close borders england france take troops across europe match us

next three weeks passed pleasantly jack spending time could get leave brother latter often coming hour two falcon 
early may news arrived russians advanced dobrudscha commenced siege silistria 
hours later falcon several ships war way dardanelles convoying numerous store ships bound varna 
shortly afterwards generals allied armies determined varna base campaign russians accordingly towards end may troops embarked 
varna seaport surrounded undulating country park like appearance troops upon arrival delighted new quarters

weary delay occurred english french home authorities english french generals field settling point attack made upon russia 
delay disastrous one allowed enemy dangerous russians make insidious approaches 
heat great water bad indeed almost undrinkable climate notoriously unhealthy one fruit kinds together cucumbers melons extremely cheap soldiers consequently consumed large quantities 
june middle july however evil consequences apparent

night th cholera broke morning one division less men lay dead

men leaving boats towing alongside rushed guns heavy fire falcon speedily silenced opponents 
object reconnoitre fight captain stuart steamed sea 
determined however obtain information respecting bay appeared one adapted purpose landing 
keep till nightfall mr hethcote 
run close dare showing lights ask take boat muffled oars row village 
make way among houses quietly possible seize couple fishermen bring

cutlasses sharpened pistols cleaned 
less excitement midshipmen berth known simmonds go gig one knew accompany launch 
however jack turned lucky one mr pascoe probably glad please first lieutenant selecting relation although officer would shown favoritism behalf 
eleven clock falcon approached former position rather point mile seaward nearly master could bring night extremely dark land scarcely visible 
light shown voice raised board sound heard gentle splash paddles revolved slowest rate speed 
falls greased rowlocks muffled crew took places perfect silence 
understand mr hethcote captain stuart last words attempt landing slightest opposition 
quietly boats left falcon side 
rowed abreast close order first lieutenant could give orders mr pascoe low tone 
men ordered row quietly avoid splashing throwing water 
longer row expected evident master deceived uncertain light brought vessel point considerably farther shore intended 
got well bay could see lights village ahead occasional gleam near points either side showed men batteries awake active 
boat neared shore men rowed according first lieutenant orders gently last line beach ahead became distinctly visible order given lie upon oars 
listened intently mr hethcote put helm boat still way drifted even closer launch 
hear anything mr pascoe know sir 
seem make distinct sound certainly appears sort murmur air

however may horses anywhere 
paddle slowly 
lay within boat length shore mr pascoe keep gun trained village let men hold arms readiness 
another minute gig bow grated beach

beach sandy one footsteps sailors almost noiseless stole towards village 
place seemed hushed quiet entered little street figure standing shade house rather larger rest stepped forward challenged bringing musket present 
instant later fired words russian sentry broke first lieutenant lips 
almost simultaneously three four shots fired points along beach 
rocket whizzed high air side bay bugle sounded alarm voices command heard enchantment chaos sounds followed deep silence reigned every house armed men poured

let men waste time firing 
volley launch momentarily checked enemy got round another discharge gun arrested 
boats however thirty yards shore lined dark figures opened tremendous fire musketry 
row lads row mr pascoe shouted men 
shall sight another hundred yards 
chapter vi 
alma desperately men bent oars heavy boat surged water 
around swept storm musket balls although darkness haste rendered fire russians wild uncertain many shot took effect 
sigh mr pascoe fell jack sitting next moment jack experienced sensation hot iron passed across arm 
several men dropped oars fell back boats still held rapidly way two three minutes safe anything random shot 
moment however three field pieces opened grape iron hail tore water near 
fortunately almost sight although forts threw rockets light bay joined fire field guns boat escaped untouched 
thank god mr hethcote said fire ceased boats headed light hung direct 
many hurt mr pascoe afraid sir mr pascoe either killed badly wounded 
lying gives answer speak

pull away lads mr hethcote said shortly

casualties hope mr hethcote captain stuart said first lieutenant stepped board 
seem got nest hornets 
yes indeed sir 
strong garrison village suffered fear heavily 
eight ten killed many wounded 
dear dear captain stuart said 
unfortunate circumstance indeed 
mr manders get wounded board carried 
step cabin mr hethcote give full details unfortunate affair upon mustering men found total casualties two boats falcon amounted lieutenant pascoe killed midshipman archer wounded ten seamen killed nine wounded 
jack wound severe first thought 
ball gone upper part arm grazed badly bruised bone passage 
doctor said would probably weeks would arm sling 
falcon spent another week examining crimean coast ran across varna 
everything pushed forward start 
six hundred vessels assembled tonnage vastly exceeding fleet ever sailed seas 
twenty seven thousand english twenty three thousand french carried huge flotilla although french army considerably larger english means sea transport latter vastly superior able take across whole army single trip whereas french could convey half force 
unfortunately lord raglan english commander chief marshal saint arnaud french commander little concert agreement 
french whose arrangements far better whose movements prompter always complaining british procrastination english general went quietly way certainly tried sorely patience allies 
even whole allied armies embarked nothing settled beyond fact going invade crimea enormous fleet men war transports steamers sailing vessels tow extending lines farther eye could reach covering many square miles sea sailed eastward without fixed destination 
consequence might expected lamentable waste time 
halts called councils held reconnaissances sent forward vast fleet steamed aimlessly north south east west last landing place fixed upon near eupatoria disembarkation effected fourteen precious days wasted journey generally performed twenty four hours even slowly moving transports might easily accomplished three days 
consequence russians time march round large bodies troops side object expedition capture sebastopol coup de main altogether thwarted 
imposing sight ever seen witnessed bands cossacks low shores crimea allied fleets anchored miles south eupatoria

day tremendous work 
man officer carried three days provisions tents unnecessary stores landed 
artillery however got ashore work landing guns shingly beach laborious one indeed 
horses vain tugged strained sailors leaped water worked breast high wheels succeeded getting ashore 
jack asked permission captain stuart spend night shore brother going ship last time 
simmonds obtained acting commission place mr pascoe said archer advise take tarpaulin couple bottles rum 
useful morning tell going nasty night 
indeed rain already coming steadily wind rising 
took part ever forget first night crimea 
wind blew pitilessly rain poured torrents twenty seven thousand englishmen lay without shelter muddy fields drenched skin 
jack trouble finding brother regiment advance two three miles landing place 
harry delighted see sight tarpaulin bottles decrease warmth welcome 
jack already acquainted officers hallo archer young ensign said place remained snugly board ship 
nice night long daylight lasted officers stood groups chatted prospects campaign 
nothing possibility seeing comforts men

big tarpaulin jack twelve feet square jack said pretty heavy found tell 
better asked harry 
lie know colonel sitting exposed rain 
best thing jack said minute consideration would make sort tent 
could put slant six feet high front back wind would shelter lot fellows 
might hang blankets sides 
captain lieutenant harry company taken consultation aid half dozen soldiers muskets bound together ramrods penthouse shelter made 
sods laid lower edge keep

harry invited colonel officers use although space limited greater portion managed sit could find room taking places front tent afforded considerable shelter wind rain 
one thought sleeping 
pipes lighted jack two bottles rum afforded tot 
night could scarcely called comfortable one even aids luxurious indeed comparison passed exposed full force wind 
next morning jack said good bye brother officers regiment presented tarpaulin future use folded smuggled ammunition cart 
course jack give government property would able pay regulation price return 
half hour later jack beach high surf beating 
day work landing cavalry artillery went greatest difficulties 
many boats staved rendered useless several chargers drowned 
evident weather breaking ten days lovely weather wasted sea bitterly regretted ever 
tents landed troops remained wet skin additional mortification seeing french allies snugly housed canvas even turks managed bring tents 
natural result sickness attacked troops hundreds prostrated three days later met enemy alma
