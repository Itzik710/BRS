thus presence otomie died cuitlahua emperor aztecs reigned fifteen weeks 
nation mourned king chief many thousand children pestilence swept mansions sun perchance darkness behind stars 
mourning long urgency times necessary new emperor crowned take command armies rule nation 
therefore morrow burial cuitlahua council four electors convened lesser nobles princes number three hundred among right rank general husband princess otomie 
great need deliberation indeed though names several mentioned princes knew one man birth courage nobility mind fitted cope troubles nation 
man guatemoc friend blood brother nephew two last emperors husband wife sister montezuma daughter tecuichpo 
knew say except strangely enough guatemoc passed council named two princes saying without doubt choice lay 
splendid solemn sight gathering four great lords electors dressed magnificent robes lesser council confirmation three hundred lords princes sat without circle hearing passed 
solemn also prayer high priest clad robes sable seemed like blot ink dropped glitter gold 
thus prayed god thou art everywhere seest knowest cuitlahua king gathered thee

henceforth vow service country war teules 
make peace take rest till driven back whence came till dead beneath swords 
none say gods store us may victory may destruction triumph death let us swear great oath together people brethren 
let us swear fight teules traitors abet cities hearths altars till cities smoking ruin till hearths cumbered dead altars run red blood worshippers 
destined conquer triumph shall made sure doomed fail least story told us 
swear people brethren swear answered shout 
well said guatemoc 
may everlasting shame overtake breaks oath 
thus guatemoc last greatest aztec emperors elected throne forefathers 
happy could foresee dreadful day noblest men must meet felon doom hand teules 
yet came destiny lay upon land smote alike indeed greater man certain fate 
done hurried palace tell otomie come pass found sleeping chamber lying bed 
ails otomie asked 
alas husband answered pestilence stricken 
come near pray come near 
let nursed women 
shall risk life beloved 
peace said came 
true physician knew symptoms well 
indeed skill otomie would died 
three long weeks fought death bedside end conquered 
fever left thanks treatment single scar upon lovely face 
eight days mind wandered without ceasing learned deep perfect love 
nothing rave secret terror heart disclosed cease care beauty love might pall upon leave flower maid named lily dwelt across sea draw back magic burden madness 
length senses returned spoke saying long lain ill husband told said nursed foul sickness yes otomie tended 
done good murmured 
dreadful thought seemed strike moaned though pain said mirror swift bring mirror gave one rising arm eagerly scanned face dim light shadowed room let plate burnished gold fall sank back faint happy cry feared said feared become hideous pestilence smitten would cease love better die 
shame said 
think love frightened away scars yes otomie answered love man love mine husband 
thus ah shudder think within year would hated 
perhaps another fair maid far away would hated 
nay know though know also lived feel hate 
oh thankful thankful 
left marvelling great love given wondering also truth words heart man could ungrateful vile 
supposing otomie many walked streets tenoctitlan day mass dreadful scars hairless blind whitened eyeballs shrunk know thank heaven trial put upon constancy 
sure become leper even otomie would shrunk 
otomie recovered great sickness shortly afterwards pestilence passed away tenoctitlan 
many things think choosing guatemoc friend blood brother emperor meant much advancement made general highest class principal adviser councils 
spare service labored day night work preparing city siege marshalling troops especially army otomies came promised number twenty thousand 
work hard indeed indian tribes lacked discipline powers unity without thousands little avail war white men 
also great jealousies leaders must overcome object jealousy 
moreover many tribes took occasion trouble aztecs throw allegiance vassalage even join spaniards remain neutral watching event war 
still labored dividing armies regiments fashion europe stationing quarter drilling better use arms provisioning city siege weeding many useless mouths might one man tenoctitlan toiled tasks heavily guatemoc emperor rest day night 
tried even make powder sulphur brought throat volcan popo knowledge art failed 
indeed would availed us little succeeded neither arquebusses cannons skill cast could used mining roads gateways perhaps grenades thrown hand 
months went till length spies came tidings spaniards advancing numbers countless hosts allies 
would sent otomie seek safety among people laughed scorn said husband 
shall suffered face death perhaps find side die fashion white women leave beloved stay 
chapter xxvii fall tenoctitlan shortly christmas marched coast great array spaniards many joined banner sea tens thousands native allies cortes took head quarters tezcuco valley mexico 
town situated near borders lake distance several leagues tenoctitlan edge territory tlascalans allies suitable cortes base action 
began one terrible wars world seen 
eight months raged ceased length tenoctitlan many beautiful populous towns blackened ruins aztecs dead sword famine nation crushed ever 
details war purpose write would end book tale tell 
therefore leave maker histories 
let enough say plan cortes destroy vassal allied cities peoples grappled mexico queen valley set skill valor straightness purpose scarcely shown general since days caesar 
iztapalapan first fall ten thousand men women children put sword burned alive 
came turn others one one cortes reduced cities till whole girdle hand tenoctitlan alone remained untouched 
many indeed surrendered nations anahuac various blood bundle reeds tree 
thus power spain cut band empire bound together fell way unity 
came power guatemoc weakened cortes increased garnered loosened reeds basket 
indeed people saw mexico met match many ancient hate smouldering rivalry broke flame fell upon tore like half tamed wolves upon master scourge broken 
brought fall anahuac 
remained true forgotten feuds jealousies stood spaniards one man tenoctitlan would never fallen cortes every teule company stretched upon stone sacrifice 
say took pen write book every wrong revenges last upon man people wrought 
mexico destroyed abomination worship gods 
feuds allied peoples root horrible rites human sacrifice 
time past cities captives dragged altars gods mexico slaughtered devoured cannibal worshippers 
outrages remembered arm queen valley withered children slain rose slay drag children altars 
month may strive would never gallant fight made allies crushed deserted us siege city began 
began land water incredible resource cortes caused thirteen brigantines war constructed tlascala conveyed pieces twenty leagues across mountains camp whence floated lake canal hollowed labor ten thousand indians worked without cease two months 
bearers brigantines escorted army twenty thousand tlascalans could way army attacked mountain passes 
thought guatemoc also troops spare force despatched threaten city named chalco though people aztec blood ashamed desert aztec cause 
still offered lead twenty thousand otomies commanded tlascalan convoy matter debated hotly council war 
council risking engagement spaniards allies far city thus opportunity went return 
evil fortune like rest end brigantines brought fall tenoctitlan cutting supply food carried canoes across lake 
alas bravest nothing power famine 
hunger great man indians say 
aztecs fighting alone face face foes last struggle began 
first spaniards cut aqueduct supplied city water springs royal house chapoltepec whither taken brought mexico 
henceforth till end siege water found drink brackish muddy fluid furnished lake wells sunk soil 
although might drunk boiling free salt unwholesome filthy taste breeding various painful sicknesses fevers 
day cutting aqueduct otomie bore son first born 
already hardships siege great nourishing food scarce less strong possessed less skill medicine think would died 
still recovered great thankfulness joy though clerk baptized boy christian church hand naming thomas 
day day week week fighting went varying success sometimes suburbs city sometimes lake sometimes streets 
time time spaniards driven back loss time time advanced different camps 
captured sixty thousand allies 
sacrificed altar huitzel given devoured aztecs according beastlike custom anahuac enjoined eating bodies offered gods indians love meat secret religious reason 
vain pray guatemoc forego horror 
time gentleness answered fiercely 
save altar would could 
let dogs die according custom land teule brother say presume far 
alas heart guatemoc grew ever fiercer struggle wore indeed little wondered 
dreadful plan cortes destroy city piecemeal advanced towards heart carried without mercy 
soon spaniards got footing quarter thousands tlascalans set work fire houses burn alive 
siege done tenoctitlan queen valley heap blackened ruins 
cortes might cried mexico isaiah prophet thy pomp brought grave noise thy viols worm spread thee worms cover thee 
art thou fallen heaven lucifer son morning art thou cut ground didst weaken nations fights took part though become boast prowess 
still spaniards knew well good reason 
whenever saw would greet revilings calling traitor renegade guatemoc white dog moreover cortes set price upon head knew spies guatemoc successful attacks stratagems devising 
took heed even insults pierced like arrows though many aztecs friends hated spaniards shameful thing christian man warring side cannibals made human sacrifice 
took heed since always seeking foe de garcia
