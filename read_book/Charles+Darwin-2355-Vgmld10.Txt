formation vegetable mould action worms observations habits 
charles darwin introduction 
share worms taken formation layer vegetable mould covers whole surface land every moderately humid country subject present volume 
mould generally blackish color inches thickness 
different districts differs little appearance although may rest various subsoils 
uniform fineness particles composed one chief characteristic features may well observed gravelly country recently ploughed field immediately adjoins one long remained undisturbed pasture vegetable mould exposed sides ditch hole 
subject may appear insignificant one shall see possesses interest maxim de minimis non curat lex apply science 
even elie de beaumont generally undervalues small agencies accumulated effects remarks la couche tres mince de la terre vegetale est un monument une haute antiquite et par le fait de sa permanence un objet digne occuper le geologue et capable de lui fournir des remarques interessantes 
although superficial layer vegetable mould whole doubt highest antiquity yet regard permanence shall hereafter see reason believe component particles cases removed slow rate replaced others due disintegration underlying materials 
led keep study many months worms pots filled earth became interested wished learn far acted consciously much mental power displayed 
desirous learn something head observations kind made far know animals low scale organization poorly provided sense organs earth worms 
year short paper read geological society london formation mould shown small fragments burnt marl cinders c thickly strewed surface several meadows found years lying depth inches beneath turf still forming layer 
apparent sinking superficial bodies due first suggested mr wedgwood maer hall staffordshire large quantity fine earth continually brought surface worms form castings 
castings sooner later spread cover object left surface 
thus led conclude vegetable mould whole country passed many times pass many times intestinal canals worms 
hence term animal mould would respects appropriate commonly used vegetable mould 
ten years publication paper archiac evidently influenced doctrines elie de beaumont wrote singuliere theorie objected could apply les prairies basses et humides les terres labourees les bois les prairies elevees n apportent aucune preuve l appui de cette maniere de voir 
archiac must thus argued inner consciousness observation worms abound extraordinary degree kitchen gardens soil continually worked though loose soil generally deposit castings open cavities within old burrows instead surface 
hensen estimates twice many worms gardens corn fields 
respect prairies elevees know may france nowhere england seen ground thickly covered castings commons height several hundred feet sea 
woods loose leaves autumn removed whole surface found strewed castings 
dr king superintendent botanic garden calcutta whose kindness indebted many observations earth worms informs found near nancy france bottom state forests covered many acres spongy layer composed dead leaves innumerable worm castings 
heard professor amenagement des forets lecturing pupils pointing case beautiful example natural cultivation soil year year thrown castings cover dead leaves result rich humus great thickness 
year mr fish rejected conclusions respect part worms played formation vegetable mould merely account assumed incapacity much work

chapter habits worms 
nature sites inhabited live long water nocturnal wander night often lie close mouths burrows thus destroyed large numbers birds structure possess eyes distinguish light darkness retreat rapidly brightly illuminated reflex action power attention sensitive heat cold completely deaf sensitive vibrations touch feeble power smell taste mental qualities nature food omnivorous digestion leaves swallowed moistened fluid nature pancreatic secretion extra stomachal digestion calciferous glands structure calcareous concretions formed anterior pair glands calcareous matter primarily excretion secondarily serves neutralise acids generated digestive process 
earth worms distributed throughout world form genera externally closely similar one another 
british species lumbricus never carefully monographed may judge probable number inhabiting neighbouring countries 
scandinavia eight species according eisen two rarely burrow ground one inhabits wet places even lives water 
concerned kinds bring earth surface form castings 
hoffmeister says species germany well known gives number eisen together strongly marked varieties 
earth worms abound england many different stations 
castings may seen extraordinary numbers commons chalk downs almost cover whole surface soil poor grass short thin 
almost quite numerous london parks grass grows well soil appears rich 
even field worms much frequent places others without visible difference nature soil 
abound paved court yards close houses instance given burrowed floor damp cellar 
seen worms black peat boggy field extremely rare quite absent drier brown fibrous peat much valued gardeners 
dry sandy gravelly tracks heath gorse ferns coarse grass moss lichens alone grow hardly worms found 
many parts england wherever path crosses heath surface becomes covered fine short sward 
whether change vegetation due taller plants killed occasional trampling man animals soil occasionally manured droppings animals know 
grassy paths worm castings may often seen 
heath surrey carefully examined castings paths much inclined level parts bed fine earth washed steeper parts accumulated thickness inches worm castings abounded 
spots seemed overstocked worms compelled spread distance feet grassy paths castings thrown among heath beyond limit single casting could found 
layer though thin one fine earth probably long retains moisture cases believe necessary existence mere compression soil appears degree favourable often abound old gravel walks foot paths across fields 
beneath large trees castings found certain seasons year apparently due moisture sucked ground innumerable roots trees places may seen covered castings heavy autumnal rains 
although coppices woods support many worms yet forest tall ancient beech trees knole park ground beneath bare vegetation single casting could found wide spaces even autumn 
nevertheless castings abundant grass covered glades indentations penetrated forest 
mountains north wales alps worms informed places rare may perhaps due close proximity subjacent rocks worms burrow winter escape frozen 
dr mcintosh however found worm castings height feet schiehallion scotland 
numerous hills near turin feet sea great altitude nilgiri mountains south india himalaya 
earth worms must considered terrestrial animals though still one sense semi aquatic like members great class annelids belong 
perrier found exposure dry air room single night fatal 
hand kept several large worms alive nearly four months completely submerged water 
summer ground dry penetrate considerable depth cease work winter ground frozen 
worms nocturnal habits night may seen crawling large numbers usually tails still inserted burrows 
expansion part bodies help short slightly reflexed bristles bodies armed hold fast seldom dragged ground without torn pieces 
day remain burrows except pairing season inhabit adjoining burrows expose greater part bodies hour two early morning 
sick individuals generally affected parasitic larvae fly must also excepted wander day die surface 
heavy rain succeeding dry weather astonishing number dead worms may sometimes seen lying ground 
mr galton informs one occasion march dead worms averaged one every two half paces length walk hyde park four paces width 
counted less dead worms one place length sixteen paces 
facts given probable worms could drowned drowned would perished burrows 
believe already sick deaths merely hastened ground flooded 
often said ordinary circumstances healthy worms never rarely completely leave burrows night error white selborne long ago knew 
morning heavy rain film mud fine sand gravel walks often plainly marked tracks 
noticed august may months included probably occurs two remaining months year wet 
occasions dead worms could anywhere seen 
january long continued unusually severe frost much snow soon thaw set walks marked innumerable tracks 
one occasion five tracks counted crossing space inch square 
could sometimes traced either mouths burrows gravel walks distances yards 
never seen two tracks leading burrow likely shall presently see sense organs worm could find way back burrow left 
apparently leave burrows voyage discovery thus find new sites inhabit 
morren states worms often lie hours almost motionless close beneath mouths burrows 
occasionally noticed fact worms kept pots house looking burrows heads could seen 
ejected earth rubbish burrows suddenly removed end worm body may often seen rapidly retreating 
habit lying near surface leads destruction immense extent 
every morning certain seasons year thrushes blackbirds lawns throughout country draw holes astonishing number worms could unless lay close surface 
probable worms behave manner sake breathing fresh air seen live long time water 
believe lie near surface sake warmth especially morning shall hereafter find often coat mouths burrows leaves apparently prevent bodies coming close contact cold damp earth 
said completely close burrows winter 
structure 
remarks must made subject 
body large worm consists almost cylindrical rings segments furnished minute bristles 
muscular system well developed 
worms crawl backwards well forwards aid affixed tails retreat extraordinary rapidity burrows 
mouth situated anterior end body provided little projection lobe lip variously called used prehension 
internally behind mouth strong pharynx shown accompanying diagram fig 
pushed forwards animal eats part corresponds according perrier protrudable trunk proboscis annelids 
pharynx leads oesophagus side lower part three pairs large glands secrete surprising amount carbonate lime 
calciferous glands highly remarkable nothing like known animal 
use discussed treat digestive process 
species oesophagus enlarged crop front gizzard 
latter organ lined smooth thick chitinous membrane surrounded weak longitudinal powerful transverse muscles 
perrier saw muscles energetic action remarks trituration food must chiefly effected organ worms possess jaws teeth kind 
grains sand small stones little inch diameter may generally found gizzards intestines 
certain worms swallow many little stones independently swallowed excavating burrows probable serve like mill stones triturate food 
gizzard opens intestine runs straight course vent posterior end body 
intestine presents remarkable structure typhlosolis old anatomists called intestine within intestine claparede shown consists deep longitudinal involution walls intestine means extensive absorbent surface gained 
circulatory system well developed 
worms breathe skin possess special respiratory organs 
two sexes united individual two individuals pair together 
nervous system fairly well developed two almost confluent cerebral ganglia situated near anterior end body 
senses 
worms destitute eyes first thought quite insensible light kept confinement repeatedly observed aid candle others doors aid lantern yet rarely alarmed although extremely timid animals 
persons found difficulty observing worms night means 
hoffmeister however states worms exception individuals extremely sensitive light admits cases certain time requisite action 
statements led watch many successive nights worms kept pots protected currents air means glass plates 
pots approached gently order vibration floor caused 
circumstances worms illuminated bull eye lantern slides dark red blue glass intercepted much light could seen difficulty affected amount light however long exposed 
light far could judge brighter full moon 
color apparently made difference result 
illuminated candle even bright paraffin lamp usually affected first 
light alternately admitted shut 
sometimes however behaved differently soon light fell withdrew burrows almost instantaneous rapidity 
occurred perhaps dozen times 
withdraw instantly often raised anterior tapering ends bodies ground attention aroused surprise felt moved bodies side side feeling object 
appeared distressed light doubt whether really case two occasions withdrawing slowly remained long time anterior extremities protruding little mouths burrows position ready instant complete withdrawal 
light candle concentrated means large lens anterior extremity generally withdrew instantly concentrated light failed act perhaps half dozen trials 
light one occasion concentrated worm lying beneath water saucer instantly withdrew burrow 
cases duration light unless extremely feeble made great difference result worms left exposed paraffin lamp candle invariably retreated burrows within five fifteen minutes evening pots illuminated worms come burrows failed appear 
foregoing facts evident light affects worms intensity duration 
anterior extremity body cerebral ganglia lie affected light hoffmeister asserts observed many occasions 
part shaded parts body may fully illuminated effect produced 
animals eyes must suppose light passes skins manner excites cerebral ganglia 
appeared first probable different manner affected different occasions might explained either degree extension skin consequent transparency particular incident light could discover relation 
one thing manifest namely worms employed dragging leaves burrows eating even short intervals whilst rested work either perceive light regardless occurred even light concentrated large lens 
whilst paired remain hour two burrows fully exposed morning light appears hoffmeister says light occasionally cause paired individuals separate 
worm suddenly illuminated dashes like rabbit burrow use expression employed friend first led look action reflex one 
irritation cerebral ganglia appears cause certain muscles contract inevitable manner independently consciousness animal automaton 
different effect light produced different occasions especially fact worm way employed intervals employment whatever set muscles ganglia may brought play often regardless light opposed view sudden withdrawal simple reflex action 
higher animals close attention object leads disregard impressions objects must producing attribute attention absorbed attention implies presence mind 
every sportsman knows approach animals whilst grazing fighting courting much easily times 
state also nervous system higher animals differs much different times instance horse much readily startled one time another 
comparison implied actions one higher animals one low scale earth worm may appear far fetched thus attribute worm attention mental power nevertheless see reason doubt justice comparison 
although worms said possess power vision sensitiveness light enables distinguish day night thus escape extreme danger many diurnal animals prey 
withdrawal burrows day appears however become habitual action worms kept pots covered glass plates sheets black paper spread placed north east window remained day time burrows came every night continued thus act week 
doubt little light may entered sheets glass blackened paper know trials colored glass worms indifferent small amount light 
worms appear less sensitive moderate radiant heat bright light 
judge held different times poker heated dull redness near worms distance caused sensible degree warmth hand 
one took notice second withdrew burrow quickly third fourth much quickly fifth quickly possible 
light candle concentrated lens passing sheet glass would intercept heat rays generally caused much rapid retreat heated poker 
worms sensitive low temperature may inferred coming burrows frost 
worms possess sense hearing 
took least notice shrill notes metal whistle repeatedly sounded near deepest loudest tones bassoon 
indifferent shouts care taken breath strike 
placed table close keys piano played loudly possible remained perfectly quiet 
although indifferent undulations air audible us extremely sensitive vibrations solid object 
pots containing two worms remained quite indifferent sound piano placed instrument note c bass clef struck instantly retreated burrows 
time emerged g line treble clef struck retreated 
similar circumstances another night one worm dashed burrow high note struck worm c treble clef struck 
occasions worms touching sides pots stood saucers vibrations reaching bodies pass sounding board piano saucer bottom pot damp compact earth lay tails burrows 
often showed sensitiveness pot lived table pot stood accidentally lightly struck appeared less sensitive jars vibrations piano sensitiveness jars varied much different times 
often said ground beaten otherwise made tremble worms believe pursued mole leave burrows 
one account received doubt often case gentleman informs lately saw eight ten worms leave burrows crawl grass boggy land two men trampled setting trap occurred part ireland moles 
assured volunteer often seen many large earth worms crawling quickly grass minutes company fired volley blank cartridges 
peewit tringa vanellus linn 
seems know instinctively worms emerge ground made tremble bishop stanley states hear mr moorhouse young peewit kept confinement used stand one leg beat turf leg worms crawled burrows instantly devoured 
nevertheless worms invariably leave burrows ground made tremble know beaten spade perhaps beaten violently 
whole body worm sensitive contact 
slight puff air mouth causes instant retreat 
glass plates placed pots fit closely blowing narrow chinks thus left often sufficed cause rapid retreat 
sometimes perceived eddies air caused quickly removing glass plates 
worm first comes burrow generally moves much extended anterior extremity body side side directions apparently organ touch reason believe shall see next chapter thus enabled gain general notion form object 
senses touch including term perception vibration seems much highly developed 
worms sense smell apparently confined perception certain odours feeble 
quite indifferent breath long breathed gently 
tried appeared possible might thus warned approach enemy 
exhibited indifference breath whilst chewed tobacco pellet cotton wool drops millefleurs perfume acetic acid kept mouth 
pellets cotton wool soaked tobacco juice millefleurs perfume paraffin held pincers waved within two three inches several worms took notice 
one two occasions however acetic acid placed pellets worms appeared little uneasy probably due irritation skins 
perception unnatural odours would service worms timid creatures would almost certainly exhibit signs new impression may conclude perceive odours 
result different cabbage leaves pieces onion employed devoured much relish worms 
small square pieces fresh half decayed cabbage leaves onion bulbs nine occasions buried pots beneath 
inch common garden soil always discovered worms 
one bit cabbage discovered removed course two hours three removed next morning single night two others two nights seventh bit three nights 
two pieces onion discovered removed three nights 
bits fresh raw meat worms fond buried discovered within forty eight hours time become putrid 
earth various buried objects generally pressed slightly prevent emission odour 
two occasions however surface well watered thus rendered somewhat compact 
bits cabbage onion removed looked beneath see whether worms accidentally come sign burrow twice buried objects laid pieces tin foil least displaced 
course possible worms whilst moving surface ground tails affixed within burrows may poked heads places objects buried never seen worms acting manner 
pieces cabbage leaf onion twice buried beneath fine ferruginous sand slightly pressed well watered rendered compact pieces never discovered 
third occasion kind sand neither pressed watered pieces cabbage discovered removed second night 
several facts indicate worms possess power smell discover means odoriferous much coveted kinds food 
may presumed animals feed various substances possess sense taste certainly case worms 
cabbage leaves much liked worms appears distinguish different varieties may perhaps owing differences texture 
eleven occasions pieces fresh leaves common green variety red variety used pickling given preferred green red either wholly neglected much less gnawed 
two occasions however seemed prefer red 
half decayed leaves red variety fresh leaves green attacked equally 
leaves cabbage horse radish favorite food onion given together latter always manifestly preferred 
leaves cabbage lime tree ampelopsis parsnip pastinaca celery apium likewise given together celery first eaten 
leaves cabbage turnip beet celery wild cherry carrots given together two latter kinds especially carrot preferred others including celery 
also manifest many trials wild cherry leaves greatly preferred lime tree hazel corylus 
according mr bridgman half decayed leaves phlox verna particularly liked worms 
pieces leaves cabbage turnip horse radish onion left pots days attacked renewed whole time leaves artemisia culinary sage thyme mint mingled leaves quite neglected excepting mint occasionally slightly nibbled 
latter four kinds leaves differ texture manner could make disagreeable worms strong taste four first mentioned kinds leaves wide difference result must attributed preference worms one taste another 
mental qualities 
little said head 
seen worms timid 
may doubted whether suffer much pain injured seem express contortions 
judging eagerness certain kinds food must enjoy pleasure eating 
sexual passion strong enough overcome time dread light 
perhaps trace social feeling disturbed crawling bodies sometimes lie contact 
according hoffmeister pass winter either singly rolled others ball bottom burrows 
although worms remarkably deficient several sense organs necessarily preclude intelligence know cases laura bridgman seen attention engaged neglect impressions would otherwise attended attention indicates presence mind kind 
also much easily excited certain times others 
perform actions instinctively individuals including young perform actions nearly fashion 
shown manner species perichaeta eject castings construct towers also manner burrows common earth worm smoothly lined fine earth often little stones mouths burrows leaves 
one strongest instincts plugging mouths burrows various objects young worms act manner 
degree intelligence appears shall see next chapter exhibited work result surprised anything else regard worms 
food digestion 
worms omnivorous 
swallow enormous quantity earth extract digestible matter may contain subject must recur 
also consume large number half decayed leaves kinds excepting unpleasant taste tough likewise petioles peduncles decayed flowers 
also consume fresh leaves found repeated trials 
according morren eat particles sugar liquorice worms kept drew many bits dry starch burrows large bit angles well rounded fluid poured mouths 
often drag particles soft stone chalk burrows feel doubt whether starch used food 
pieces raw roasted meat fixed several times long pins surface soil pots night night worms could seen tugging edges pieces engulfed mouths much consumed 
raw fat seems preferred even raw meat substance given much consumed 
cannibals two halves dead worm placed two pots dragged burrows gnawed far could judge prefer fresh putrid meat far differ hoffmeister 
leon fredericq states digestive fluid worms nature pancreatic secretion higher animals conclusion agrees perfectly kinds food worms consume 
pancreatic juice emulsifies fat seen greedily worms devour fat dissolves fibrin worms eat raw meat converts starch grape sugar wonderful rapidity shall presently show digestive fluid worms acts starch 
live chiefly half decayed leaves would useless unless could digest cellulose forming cell walls well known nutritious substances almost completely withdrawn leaves shortly fall 
however ascertained forms cellulose though little attacked gastric secretion higher animals acted pancreas 
half decayed fresh leaves worms intend devour dragged mouths burrows depth one three inches moistened secreted fluid 
assumed fluid serves hasten decay large number leaves twice pulled burrows worms kept many weeks moist atmosphere bell glass study parts moistened worms decay quickly plain manner parts 
fresh leaves given evening worms kept confinement examined early next morning therefore many hours dragged burrows fluid moistened tested neutral litmus paper showed alkaline reaction 
repeatedly found case celery cabbage turnip leaves 
parts leaves moistened worms pounded drops distilled water juice thus extracted alkaline 
leaves however drawn burrows doors unknown antecedent period tried though still moist rarely exhibited even trace alkaline reaction 
fluid leaves bathed acts whilst fresh nearly fresh remarkable manner quickly kills discolors 
thus ends fresh carrot leaf dragged burrow found twelve hours dark brown tint 
leaves celery turnip maple elm lime thin leaves ivy occasionally cabbage similarly acted 
end leaf triticum repens still attached growing plant drawn burrow part dark brown dead whilst rest leaf fresh green 
several leaves lime elm removed burrows doors found affected different degrees 
first change appears veins become dull reddish orange 
cells chlorophyll next lose less completely green color contents finally become brown 
parts thus affected often appeared almost black reflected light viewed transparent object microscope minute specks light transmitted case unaffected parts leaves 
effects however merely show secreted fluid highly injurious poisonous leaves nearly effects produced one two days various kinds young leaves artificial pancreatic fluid prepared without thymol quickly solution thymol 
one occasion leaves corylus much discolored kept eighteen hours pancreatic fluid without thymol 
young tender leaves immersion human saliva rather warm weather acted manner pancreatic fluid quickly 
leaves cases often became infiltrated fluid 
large leaves ivy plant growing wall tough could gnawed worms four days affected peculiar manner secretion poured mouths 
upper surfaces leaves worms crawled shown dirt left marked sinuous lines either continuous broken chain whitish often star shaped dots mm 
diameter 
appearance thus presented curiously like leaf larva minute insect burrowed 
son francis making examining sections could nowhere find cell walls broken epidermis penetrated 
section passed whitish dots grains chlorophyll seen less discolored palisade mesophyll cells contained nothing broken granular matter 
effects must attributed transudation secretion epidermis cells 
secretion worms moisten leaves likewise acts starch granules within cells 
son examined leaves ash many lime fallen trees partly dragged worm burrows 
known fallen leaves starch grains preserved guard cells stomata 
several cases starch partially wholly disappeared cells parts moistened secretion still well preserved parts leaves 
sometimes starch dissolved one two guard cells 
nucleus one case disappeared together starch granules 
mere burying lime leaves damp earth nine days cause destruction starch granules 
hand immersion fresh lime cherry leaves eighteen hours artificial pancreatic fluid led dissolution starch granules guard cells well cells 
secretion leaves moistened alkaline acting starch granules protoplasmic contents cells may infer resembles nature saliva pancreatic secretion know fredericq secretion kind found intestines worms 
leaves dragged burrows often dry shrivelled indispensable disintegration unarmed mouths worms first moistened softened fresh leaves however soft tender may similarly treated probably habit 
result partially digested taken alimentary canal 
aware case extra stomachal digestion recorded 
boa constrictor said bathe prey saliva doubtful done solely sake lubricating prey 
perhaps nearest analogy may found plants drosera dionaea animal matter digested converted peptone within stomach surfaces leaves 
calciferous glands 
glands see fig 
judging size rich supply blood vessels must much importance animal 
almost many theories advanced use observers 
consist three pairs common earth worm debouch alimentary canal advance gizzard posteriorly urochaeta genera 
two posterior pairs formed lamellae according claparede diverticula oesophagus 
lamellae coated pulpy cellular layer outer cells lying free infinite numbers 
one glands punctured squeezed quantity white pulpy matter exudes consisting free cells 
minute vary diameter microns 
contain centres little excessively fine granular matter look like oil globules claparede others first treated ether 
produces effect quickly dissolved effervescence acetic acid oxalate ammonia added solution white precipitate thrown 
may therefore conclude contain carbonate lime 
cells immersed little acid become transparent look like ghosts soon lost view much acid added disappear instantly 
large number dissolved flocculent residue left apparently consists delicate ruptured cell walls 
two posterior pairs glands carbonate lime contained cells occasionally aggregates small rhombic crystals concretions lie lamellae seen one case claparede cases 
two anterior glands differ little shape four posterior ones oval 
differ also conspicuously generally containing several small two three larger single large concretion carbonate lime much 
mm 
diameter 
gland includes small concretions sometimes happens none easily overlooked 
large concretions round oval exteriorly almost smooth 
one found filled whole gland often case neck resembled olive oil flask shape 
concretions broken seen less crystalline structure 
escape gland marvel escape certain often found gizzard intestines castings worms kept confinement state nature 
claparede says little structure two anterior glands supposes calcareous matter concretions formed derived four posterior glands 
anterior gland contains small concretions placed acetic acid afterwards dissected sections made gland without treated acid lamellae like posterior glands coated cellular matter could plainly seen together multitude free calciferous cells readily soluble acetic acid 
gland completely filled single large concretion free cells consumed forming concretion 
concretion one moderately large size dissolved acid much membranous matter left appears consist remains formerly active lamellae 
formation expulsion large concretion new lamellae must developed manner 
one section made son process apparently commenced although gland contained two rather large concretions near walls several cylindrical oval pipes intersected lined cellular matter quite filled free calciferous cells 
great enlargement one direction several oval pipes would give rise lamellae 
besides free calciferous cells nucleus visible rather larger free cells seen three occasions contained distinct nucleus nucleolus 
far acted acetic acid nucleus thus rendered distinct 
small concretion removed two lamellae within anterior gland 
imbedded pulpy cellular matter many free calciferous cells together multitude larger free nucleated cells latter cells acted acetic acid former dissolved 
cases led suspect calciferous cells developed larger nucleated ones effected ascertained 
anterior gland contains several minute concretions generally angular crystalline outline greater number rounded irregular mulberry like surface 
calciferous cells adhered many parts mulberry like masses gradual disappearance could traced still remained attached 
thus evident concretions formed lime contained within free calciferous cells 
smaller concretions increase size come contact unite thus enclosing functionless lamellae steps formation largest concretions could followed 
process regularly takes place two anterior glands rarely four posterior glands quite unknown 
morren says glands disappear winter seen instances fact others either anterior posterior glands season shrunk empty could distinguished much difficulty 
respect function calciferous glands probable primarily serve organs excretion secondarily aid digestion 
worms consume many fallen leaves known lime goes accumulating leaves drop parent plant instead absorbed stem roots like various organic inorganic substances 
ashes leaf acacia known contain much per cent 
lime 
worms therefore would liable become charged earth unless special means excretion calciferous glands well adapted purpose 
worms live mould close chalk often intestines filled substance castings almost white 
evident supply calcareous matter must super abundant 
nevertheless several worms collected site calciferous glands contained many free calciferous cells fully many large concretions glands worms lived little lime indicates lime excretion secretion poured alimentary canal special purpose 
hand following considerations render highly probable carbonate lime excreted glands aids digestive process ordinary circumstances 
leaves decay generate abundance various kinds acids grouped together term humus acids 
shall recur subject fifth chapter need say acids act strongly carbonate lime 
half decayed leaves swallowed large quantities worms would therefore moistened triturated alimentary canal apt produce acids 
case several worms contents alimentary canal found plainly acid shown litmus paper 
acidity attributed nature digestive fluid pancreatic fluid alkaline seen secretion poured mouths worms sake preparing leaves consumption likewise alkaline 
acidity hardly due uric acid contents upper part intestine often acid 
one case contents gizzard slightly acid upper intestines plainly acid 
another case contents pharynx acid gizzard doubtfully intestine distinctly acid distance cm 
gizzard 
even higher herbivorous omnivorous animals contents large intestine acid 
however caused acid secretion mucous membrane reaction intestinal walls larger small intestine alkaline 
must therefore arise acid fermentations going contents carnivora contents coecum said alkaline naturally amount fermentation depend largely nature food 
worms contents intestines ejected matter castings generally acid 
thirty castings different places tested three four exceptions found acid exceptions may due castings recently ejected first acid following morning dried moistened longer acid probably resulted humus acids known case easily decomposed 
five fresh castings worms lived mould close chalk whitish color abounded calcareous matter least acid 
shows effectually carbonate lime neutralises intestinal acids 
worms kept pots filled fine ferruginous sand manifest oxide iron grains silex coated dissolved removed castings 
digestive fluid worms resembles action already stated pancreatic secretion higher animals latter pancreatic digestion essentially alkaline action take place unless alkali present activity alkaline juice arrested acidification hindered neutralization 
therefore seems highly probable innumerable calciferous cells poured four posterior glands alimentary canal worms serve neutralise less completely acids generated half decayed leaves 
seen cells instantly dissolved small quantity acetic acid always suffice neutralise contents even upper part alimentary canal lime perhaps aggregated concretions anterior pair glands order may carried posterior parts intestine concretions would rolled amongst acid contents 
concretions found intestines castings often worn appearance whether due amount attrition chemical corrosion could told 
claparede believes formed sake acting mill stones thus aiding trituration food 
may give aid way fully agree perrier must quite subordinate importance seeing object already attained stones generally present gizzards intestines worms 
chapter ii habits worms continued 
manner worms seize objects power suction instinct plugging mouths burrows stones piled burrows advantages thus gained intelligence shown worms manner plugging burrows various kinds leaves objects thus used triangles paper summary reasons believing worms exhibit intelligence means excavate burrows pushing away earth swallowing earth also swallowed nutritious matter contains depth worms burrow construction burrows burrows lined castings upper part leaves lowest part paved little stones seeds manner castings ejected collapse old burrows distribution worms tower like castings bengal gigantic castings nilgiri mountains castings ejected countries 
pots worms kept leaves pinned soil night manner seized could observed 
worms always endeavored drag leaves towards burrows tore sucked small fragments whenever leaves sufficiently tender 
generally seized thin edge leaf mouths projecting upper lower lip thick strong pharynx time perrier remarks pushed forward within bodies afford point resistance upper lip 
case broad flat objects acted wholly different manner 
pointed anterior extremity body brought contact object kind drawn within adjoining rings appeared truncated became thick rest body 
part could seen swell little believe due pharynx pushed little forwards 
slight withdrawal pharynx expansion vacuum produced beneath truncated slimy end body whilst contact object means two adhered firmly together 
circumstances vacuum produced plainly seen one occasion large worm lying beneath flaccid cabbage leaf tried drag away surface leaf directly end worm body became deeply pitted 
another occasion worm suddenly lost hold flat leaf anterior end body momentarily seen cup formed 
worms attach object beneath water manner saw one thus dragging away submerged slice onion bulb 
edges fresh nearly fresh leaves affixed ground often nibbled worms sometimes epidermis parenchyma one side gnawed completely away considerable space epidermis alone opposite side left quite clean 
veins never touched leaves thus sometimes partly converted skeletons 
worms teeth mouths consist soft tissue may presumed consume means suction edges parenchyma fresh leaves softened digestive fluid 
attack strong leaves sea kale large thick leaves ivy though one latter become rotten reduced parts state skeleton 
worms seize leaves objects serve food plugging mouths burrows one strongest instincts 
sometimes work energetically mr f simpson small walled garden worms abound bayswater informs calm damp evening heard extraordinary rustling noise tree many leaves fallen went light discovered noise caused many worms dragging dry leaves squeezing burrows 
leaves petioles many kinds flower peduncles often decayed twigs trees bits paper feathers tufts wool horse hairs dragged burrows purpose 
seen many seventeen petioles clematis projecting mouth one burrow ten mouth another 
objects petioles named feathers c never gnawed worms 
gravel walk garden found many hundred leaves pine tree p austriaca nigricans drawn bases burrows 
surfaces leaves articulated branches shaped peculiar manner joint leg bones quadruped surfaces least gnawed fact would immediately visible trace gnawing 
ordinary dicotyledonous leaves dragged burrows gnawed 
seen many nine leaves lime tree drawn burrow nearly gnawed leaves may serve store future consumption 
fallen leaves abundant many sometimes collected mouth burrow used small pile unused leaves left like roof partly dragged 
leaf dragged little way cylindrical burrow necessarily much folded crumpled 
another leaf drawn done exteriorly first one succeeding leaves finally become closely folded pressed together 
sometimes worm enlarges mouth burrow makes fresh one close draw still larger number leaves 
often generally fill interstices drawn leaves moist viscid earth ejected bodies thus mouths burrows securely plugged 
hundreds plugged burrows may seen many places especially autumnal early winter months 
hereafter shown leaves dragged burrows plugging food sake lining upper part mouth 
worms obtain leaves petioles sticks c plug mouths burrows often protect little heaps stones heaps smooth rounded pebbles may frequently seen gravel walks 
question food 
lady interested habits worms removed little heaps stones mouths several burrows cleared surface ground inches round 
went following night lantern saw worms tails fixed burrows dragging stones inwards aid mouths doubt suction 
two nights holes small stones four nights one another stones 
one stone dragged gravel walk mouth burrow weighed two ounces proves strong worms 
show greater strength sometimes displacing stones well trodden gravel walk may inferred cavities left displaced stones exactly filled lying mouths adjoining burrows observed 
work kind usually performed night occasionally known objects drawn burrows day 
advantage worms derive plugging mouths burrows leaves c piling stones doubtful 
act manner times eject much earth burrows castings serve cover mouths 
gardeners wish kill worms lawn necessary first brush rake away castings surface order lime water may enter burrows 
might inferred fact mouths plugged leaves c prevent entrance water heavy rain may urged view loose well rounded stones ill adapted keep water 
moreover seen many burrows perpendicularly cut turf edgings gravel walks water could hardly flow well plugged burrows level surface 
probable plugs piles stones serve conceal burrows scolopendras according hoffmeister bitterest enemies worms larger species carabus staphylinus attack ferociously animals nocturnal burrows opened night 
may worms mouth burrow protected able remain safety heads close know like costs many lives may plugs check free ingress lowest stratum air chilled radiation night surrounding ground herbage inclined believe latter view firstly worms kept pots room fire case cold air could enter burrows plugged slovenly manner secondarily often coat upper part burrows leaves apparently prevent bodies coming close contact cold damp earth 
mr e parfitt suggested mouths burrows closed order air within may kept thoroughly damp seems probable explanation habit 
plugging process may serve purposes 
whatever motive may appears worms much dislike leaving mouths burrows open 
nevertheless reopen night whether afterwards close 
numerous open burrows may seen recently dug ground case worms eject castings cavities left ground old burrows instead piling mouths burrows collect objects surface mouths might protected 
recently disinterred pavement roman villa abinger hereafter described worms pertinaciously opened burrows almost every night closed trampled although rarely able find minute stones wherewith protect 
intelligence shown worms manner plugging burrows 
man plug small cylindrical hole objects leaves petioles twigs would drag push pointed ends objects thin relatively size hole would probably insert thicker broader ends 
guide case would intelligence 
seemed therefore worth observe carefully worms dragged leaves burrows whether tips bases middle parts 
seemed especially desirable case plants natives country although habit dragging leaves burrows undoubtedly instinctive worms yet instinct could tell act case leaves progenitors knew nothing 
moreover worms acted solely instinct unvarying inherited impulse would draw kinds leaves burrows manner 
definite instinct might expect chance would determine whether tip base middle seized 
alternatives excluded intelligence alone left unless worm case first tries many different methods follows alone proves possible easy act manner try different methods makes near approach intelligence 
first place withered leaves various kinds mostly english plants pulled worm burrows several places 
drawn burrows near tips foot stalk projected nearly upright mouth burrow drawn bases case tips projected burrows seized near middle drawn transversely much crumpled 
therefore per cent 
always using nearest whole number drawn tip per cent

also see presence foot stalk might expected would tempted worms convenient handle little influence determining manner lime leaves dragged burrows 
considerable proportion viz per cent drawn less transversely depends doubt flexibility half decayed leaves 
fact many drawn middle drawn base renders improbable worms first tried draw leaves one methods afterwards drew per cent 
tips clear would failed drawing base middle 
leaves foreign plant next searched blades pointed towards apex towards base 
proved case laburnum hybrid cytisus alpinus laburnum doubling terminal basal half generally fitted exactly difference basal half little narrower

drawn base case lime leaves blades broad base per cent 
thus drawn 
may perhaps account fact still larger proportion laburnum leaves drawn base worms acquired habit generally drawing leaves tips thus avoiding foot stalk 
basal margin blade many kinds leaves forms large angle foot stalk leaf drawn foot stalk basal margin would come abruptly contact ground side burrow would render drawing leaf difficult 
nevertheless worms break habit avoiding foot stalk part offers convenient means drawing leaves burrows

fallen blade side midrib often becomes curled drying sometimes along whole length sometimes chiefly base sometimes towards apex

appeared son worms instantly perceived soon seized leaf proper manner 
nine cases observed one worm failed drag leaf burrow entangled leaves lying near

hand worm seized base leaf two occasions relinquished unknown motive 
already remarked habit plugging mouths burrows various objects doubt instinctive worms young one born one pots dragged little distance scotch fir leaf one needle long almost thick body 
species pine endemic part england therefore incredible proper manner dragging pine leaves burrows instinctive worms 
worms observations made dug beneath near pines planted forty years desirable prove actions instinctive 
accordingly pine leaves scattered ground places far removed pine tree drawn burrows bases 
two drawn tips needles real exceptions one drawn short distance two needles cohered 
pine leaves given worms kept pots warm room result different leaves drawn burrows less drawn tips needles 
worms however worked careless slovenly manner leaves often drawn small depth sometimes merely heaped mouths burrows sometimes none drawn 
believe carelessness may accounted either warmth air dampness pots covered glass plates worms consequently care plugging holes effectually 
pots tenanted worms covered net allowed free entrance air left doors several nights leaves properly drawn bases

doubts expressed writers whether worms ever swallow earth solely sake making burrows additional cases may given 
mass fine reddish sand inches thickness left ground nearly two years penetrated many places worms castings consisted partly reddish sand partly black earth brought beneath mass 
sand dug considerable depth poor nature weeds could grow 
therefore highly improbable swallowed worms food 
field near house castings frequently consist almost pure chalk lies little depth beneath surface improbable chalk swallowed sake little organic matter could percolated poor overlying pasture 
lastly casting thrown concrete decayed mortar tiles ruined aisle beaulieu abbey formerly paved washed coarser matter alone left 
consisted grains quartz micaceous slate rocks bricks tiles many inch diameter 
one suppose grains swallowed food yet formed half casting weighed grains whole casting weighed grains 
whenever worm burrows depth feet undisturbed compact ground must form passage swallowing earth incredible ground could yield sides pressure pharynx pushed forwards within worm body 
worms swallow larger quantity earth sake extracting nutritious matter may contain making burrows appears certain 
old belief doubted high authority claparede evidence favor must given detail

earth swallowed worms deepened burrows made new ones castings would thrown occasionally many places fresh castings may seen every morning amount earth ejected burrow successive days large

burrows run perpendicularly commonly little obliquely

dust would apt accumulate wherever old broken walls projected little existing surface thus afforded shelter

recent castings naturally flow inclined surface grassy field sloped degrees degrees several found heavy gale blown slope

mean weight earth mouths burrows leeward mouths windward side 
whereas seen several castings flowed slopes mean inclination degrees seconds three castings inclination degrees proportional weight earth burrows 
several cases show efficiently gales wind accompanied rain act displacing recently ejected castings 
may therefore conclude even moderately strong wind produce slight effect 
dry indurated castings disintegration small fragments pellets sometimes probably often blown strong wind leeward

ancient encampments tumuli 
e de beaumont adduces present state many ancient encampments tumuli old ploughed fields evidence surface land undergoes hardly degradation 
appear ever examined thickness mould different parts old remains 
relies chiefly indirect apparently trustworthy evidence slopes old embankments originally obvious could know nothing original heights 
knole park mound thrown behind rifle targets appeared formed earth originally supported square blocks turf 
sides sloped nearly could estimate angle degrees degrees horizon covered especially northern side long coarse grass beneath many worm castings found 
flowed bodily downwards others rolled pellets 
hence certain long mound kind tenanted worms height continually lowered 
fine earth flows rolls sides mound accumulates base form talus 
bed even thin bed fine earth eminently favourable worms greater number castings would tend ejected talus thus formed elsewhere would partially washed away every heavy shower spread adjoining level ground 
final result would lowering whole mound whilst inclination sides would greatly lessened 
result would assuredly follow ancient embankments tumuli except formed gravel nearly pure sand matter unfavourable worms 
many old fortifications tumuli believed least years old bear mind many places one inch mould brought surface years two inches years 
therefore long period years large amount earth repeatedly brought surface old embankments tumuli especially talus round bases much earth washed completely away 
may therefore conclude ancient mounds formed materials unfavourable worms somewhat lowered course centuries although inclinations may greatly changed 
fields formerly ploughed 
remote period many countries land ploughed convex beds called crowns ridges usually feet across separated furrows thrown 
furrows directed carry surface water 
attempts ascertain long time crowns furrows last ploughed land converted pasture obstacles many kinds encountered 
rarely known field last ploughed fields thought pasture time immemorial afterwards discovered ploughed years 
early part present century price corn high land kinds seems ploughed britain 
however reason doubt many cases old crowns furrows preserved ancient period 
preserved unequal lengths time would naturally follow crowns first thrown differed much height different districts case recently ploughed land 
old pasture fields mould wherever measurements made found 
inches thicker furrows crowns would naturally follow finer earth washed crowns furrows land well clothed turf impossible tell part worms may played work 
nevertheless seen castings would certainly tend flow washed heavy rain crowns furrows 
soon bed fine earth means accumulated furrows would favourable worms parts greater number castings would thrown elsewhere furrows sloping land usually directed carry surface water finest earth would washed castings ejected carried completely away 
result would furrows would filled slowly crowns would lowered perhaps still slowly flowing rolling castings gentle inclinations furrows 
nevertheless might expected old furrows especially sloping surface would course time filled disappear 
careful observers however examined fields gloucestershire staffordshire could detect difference state furrows upper lower parts sloping fields supposed long pasture came conclusion crowns furrows would last almost endless number centuries 
hand process obliteration seems commenced places 
thus grass field north wales known ploughed years ago sloped angle degrees north east depth furrows feet apart carefully measured found

worm castings often ejected extraordinary numbers steep grass covered slopes chalk comes close surface son william observed near winchester elsewhere 
castings largely washed away heavy rains difficult understand first mould still remain downs appear evident means supplying loss 
moreover another cause loss namely percolation finer particles earth fissures chalk chalk 
considerations led doubt time whether exaggerated amount fine earth flows rolls grass covered slopes form castings sought additional information 
places castings chalk downs consist largely calcareous matter supply course unlimited 
places instance part teg near winchester castings black effervesce acids

worms penetrate bring chalk places others know 
many districts land nearly level bed several feet thickness red clay full unworn flints overlies upper chalk 
overlying matter surface converted mould consists undissolved residue chalk 
may well recall case fragments chalk buried beneath worm castings one fields angles completely rounded course years fragments resembled water worn pebbles 
must effected carbonic acid rain ground humus acids corroding power living roots 
thick mass residue left chalk wherever land nearly level may perhaps accounted percolation fine particles fissures often present chalk either open filled impure chalk solid chalk 
percolation occurs hardly doubted

hand upper chalk properly contains informed late david forbes made many analyses per cent 
earthy matter two samples pits near house contained 

per cent 
mention latter cases thickness overlying bed red clay flints imagined underlying chalk might less pure elsewhere 
cause residue accumulating places others may attributed layer argillaceous matter left early period chalk would check subsequent percolation earthy matter 
facts given may conclude castings ejected chalk downs suffer loss percolation finer matter chalk 
impure superficial chalk dissolved would leave larger supply earthy matter added mould case pure chalk 
besides loss caused percolation fine earth certainly washed sloping grass covered surfaces downs 
washing process however checked course time although know thin layer mould suffices support worms yet limit must last reached castings would cease ejected would become scanty 
following cases show considerable quantity fine earth washed 
thickness mould measured points yards apart across small valley chalk near winchester 
sides sloped gently first became inclined degrees gently near bottom transversely almost level yards across 
bottom mean thickness mould five measurements 
inches whilst sides valley inclination varied degrees degrees mean thickness rather less

inch layer mould washed flanks valley upper part 
shepherd said seen water flowing valley sudden thawing snow possible earth may brought upper part hand may carried valley 
closely similar results respect thickness mould obtained neighbouring valley 
st catherine hill near winchester feet height consists steep cone chalk 
mile diameter

however stated parts slope bed mould often contained fragments chalk flint obviously rolled different times 
interstices underlying fragmentary chalk also filled mould 
son examined surface hill base south west direction 
beneath great ditch slope degrees mould thin namely

may therefore conclude artificially modified hill well natural valleys neighbouring chalk downs fine earth probably derived large part worm castings washed accumulates lower parts notwithstanding percolation unknown quantity underlying chalk supply fresh earthy matter afforded dissolution chalk atmospheric agencies 
chapter vii conclusion 
summary part worms played history world aid disintegration rocks denudation land preservation ancient remains preparation soil growth plants mental powers worms conclusion 
worms played important part history world persons would first suppose 
almost humid countries extraordinarily numerous size possess great muscular power 
many parts england weight ten tons kilogrammes dry earth annually passes bodies brought surface acre land whole superficial bed vegetable mould passes bodies course every years 
collapsing old burrows mould constant though slow movement particles composing thus rubbed together 
means fresh surfaces continually exposed action carbonic acid soil humus acids appear still efficient decomposition rocks 
generation humus acids probably hastened digestion many half decayed leaves worms consume 
thus particles earth forming superficial mould subjected conditions eminently favourable decomposition disintegration 
moreover particles softer rocks suffer amount mechanical trituration muscular gizzards worms small stones serve mill stones 
finely levigated castings brought surface moist condition flow rainy weather moderate slope smaller particles washed far even gently inclined surface 
castings dry often crumble small pellets apt roll sloping surface 
land quite level covered herbage climate humid much dust blown away appears first sight impossible appreciable amount sub aerial denudation worm castings blown especially whilst moist viscid one uniform direction prevalent winds accompanied rain 
several means superficial mould prevented accumulating great thickness thick bed mould checks many ways disintegration underlying rocks fragments rock 
removal worm castings means leads results far insignificant 
shown layer earth 
inch thickness many places annually brought surface small part amount flows rolls washed even short distance every inclined surface repeatedly blown one direction great effect produced course ages 
found measurements calculations surface mean inclination degrees seconds 
cubic inches earth ejected worms crossed course year horizontal line one yard length cubic inches would cross line yards length 
latter amount damp state would weigh 
pounds 
thus considerable weight earth continually moving side every valley time reach bed 
finally earth transported streams flowing valleys ocean great receptacle matter denuded land 
known amount sediment annually delivered sea mississippi enormous drainage area must average lowered 
inch year would suffice four half million years lower whole drainage area level sea shore 
small fraction layer fine earth 
inch thickness annually brought surface worms carried away great result fail produced within period geologist considers extremely long 
archaeologists ought grateful worms protect preserve indefinitely long period every object liable decay dropped surface land burying beneath castings 
thus also many elegant curious tesselated pavements ancient remains preserved though doubt worms cases largely aided earth washed blown adjoining land especially cultivated 
old tesselated pavements however often suffered subsided unequally unequally undermined worms 
even old massive walls may undermined subside building respect safe unless foundations lie feet beneath surface depth worms work 
probable many monoliths old walls fallen undermined worms 
worms prepare ground excellent manner growth fibrous rooted plants seedlings kinds 
periodically expose mould air sift stones larger particles swallow left 
mingle whole intimately together like gardener prepares fine soil choicest plants 
state well fitted retain moisture absorb soluble substances well process nitrification 
bones dead animals harder parts insects shells land molluscs leaves twigs c long buried beneath accumulated castings worms thus brought less decayed state within reach roots plants 
worms likewise drag infinite number dead leaves parts plants burrows partly sake plugging partly food 
leaves dragged burrows food torn finest shreds partially digested saturated intestinal urinary secretions commingled much earth 
earth forms dark colored rich humus almost everywhere covers surface land fairly well defined layer mantle 
hensen placed two worms vessel inches diameter filled sand fallen leaves strewed soon dragged burrows depth inches 
weeks almost uniform layer sand centimeter 
inch thickness converted humus passed alimentary canals two worms 
believed persons worm burrows often penetrate ground almost perpendicularly depth feet materially aid drainage notwithstanding viscid castings piled mouths burrows prevent check rain water directly entering 
allow air penetrate deeply ground 
also greatly facilitate downward passage roots moderate size nourished humus burrows lined 
many seeds owe germination covered castings others buried considerable depth beneath accumulated castings lie dormant future time accidentally uncovered germinate 
worms poorly provided sense organs said see although distinguish light darkness completely deaf feeble power smell sense touch alone well developed 
therefore learn little outside world surprising exhibit skill lining burrows castings leaves case species piling castings tower like constructions 
far surprising apparently exhibit degrees intelligence instead mere blind instinctive impulse manner plugging mouths burrows 
act nearly manner would man close cylindrical tube different kinds leaves petioles triangles paper c commonly seize objects pointed ends 
thin objects certain number drawn broader ends 
act unvarying manner cases lower animals instance drag leaves foot stalks unless basal part blade narrow apex narrower 
behold wide turf covered expanse remember smoothness much beauty depends mainly due inequalities slowly levelled worms 
marvellous reflection whole superficial mould expanse passed pass every years bodies worms 
plough one ancient valuable man inventions long existed land fact regularly ploughed still continues thus ploughed earth worms 
may doubted whether many animals played important part history world lowly organized creatures 
animals however still lowly organized namely corals done far conspicuous work constructed innumerable reefs islands great oceans almost confined tropical zones
