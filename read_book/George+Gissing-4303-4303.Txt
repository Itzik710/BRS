go crazy extremes 
never utopia form lying set ideals multitude 
believe distinction classes class would altogether abolish hungry ragged 
long nature doles gift brains different proportions must exist social subordination 
true radical man wishes order things one urged misery try get class born 
glazzard agreed good way putting thereupon broached subject totally different politics finally laid aside 
lilian rose withdrew friends remained several minutes silence

indeed returned laugh 
lay become successor general election comes round 
hope live parliament sha n try another 
time letter mrs wade london wherein oddly enough passage running thus say thought representing polterham spoils pleasure looking forward political life 
statesmen become one trained bear many disagreeable things
