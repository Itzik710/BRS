garden eden doubt looked fair man always think must fairer eve adorned 
return miscalculated little sun well dropped anchor point heard gun told good folks durban english mail 
late think getting bar night went comfortably dinner seeing mails carried life boat

three sir henry curtis captain good went sat wheel quiet 
well mr quatermain said sir henry presently thinking proposals ay echoed captain good think mr quatermain hope going give us pleasure company far solomon mines wherever gentleman knew neville may got 
rose knocked pipe answered 
made mind wanted additional moment decide 
burning tobacco fallen sea decided little extra second trick 
often way bothering long time thing 
yes gentlemen said sitting go leave tell conditions 
first terms ask 

pay expenses ivory valuables may get divided captain good 

give services trip start undertaking serve faithfully till choose abandon enterprise till succeed disaster overtakes us 

trek execute deed agreeing event death disablement pay boy harry studying medicine london guy hospital sum year five years time ought able earn living worth salt 
think daresay say quite enough 
answered sir henry accept gladly 
bent upon project would pay help considering peculiar exclusive knowledge possess 
pity ask go back word

something let tell one long journey like one 
journey tell flatly sir henry captain good think probable come alive attempt cross suliman mountains 
fate old dom da silvestra three hundred years ago fate descendant twenty years ago brother fate tell frankly gentlemen fates believe 
paused watch effect words 
captain good looked little uncomfortable sir henry face change 
must take chance said 
may perhaps wonder went think told timid man undertake journey 
two reasons 
first fatalist believe time appointed come quite without reference movements go suliman mountains killed shall go shall killed 
god almighty doubt knows mind need trouble point 
secondly poor man 
nearly forty years hunted traded never made living 
well gentlemen know aware average life elephant hunter time takes trade four five years 
see lived seven generations class think time far anyway 
anything happen ordinary course business time debts paid would nothing left support son harry whilst getting way earning living whereas set five years 
whole affair nutshell 
mr quatermain said sir henry giving serious attention motives undertaking enterprise believe end disaster reflect great deal credit 
whether right course time event alone show 
whether right wrong may well tell going end sweet bitter 
knocked head say hope get little shooting first eh good yes yes put captain 
three us accustomed face danger hold lives hands various ways good turning back 
vote go saloon take observation luck know 
bottom tumbler 
next day went ashore put sir henry captain good little shanty built berea call home 
three rooms kitchen constructed green brick galvanised iron roof good garden best loquot trees know nice young mangoes hope great things 
curator botanical gardens gave 
looked old hunter mine named jack whose thigh badly broken buffalo cow sikukunis country never hunt 
potter garden griqua birth 
never persuade zulu take much interest gardening 
peaceful art peaceful arts line 
sir henry good slept tent pitched little grove orange trees end garden room house smell bloom sight green golden fruit durban see three tree together daresay pleasant place enough mosquitos berea unless happens come unusually heavy rain 
well get harry tired story ever fetch suliman mountains made mind go set making necessary preparations 
first secured deed sir henry providing boy case accidents 
difficulty legal execution sir henry stranger property charged water ultimately got help lawyer charged job price thought outrageous 
pocketed cheque 
paid tribute bump caution purchased wagon span oxen sir henry behalf beauties 
twenty two foot wagon iron axles strong light built throughout stink wood quite new one diamond fields back opinion better could see wood well seasoned 
anything going give wagon green wood show first trip 
particular vehicle call half tented wagon say covered twelve feet leaving front part free necessaries carry us 
part hide cartle bed two people could sleep also racks rifles many little conveniences 
gave think cheap price 
bought beautiful team twenty zulu oxen kept eye year two 
sixteen oxen usual number team took four extra allow casualties 
zulu cattle small light half size africander oxen generally used transport purposes live africanders would starve moderate load make five miles day better going quicker liable become footsore 
lot thoroughly salted worked south africa become proof comparatively speaking red water frequently destroys whole teams oxen get strange veldt grass country 
lung sick dreadful form pneumonia prevalent country inoculated 
done cutting slit tail ox binding piece diseased lung animal died sickness 
result ox sickens takes disease mild form causes tail drop rule foot root becomes proof future attacks 
seems cruel rob animal tail especially country many flies better sacrifice tail keep ox lose tail ox tail without ox much good except dust 
still look odd trek along behind twenty stumps ought tails 
seems though nature made trifling mistake stuck stern ornaments lot prize bull dogs rumps oxen 
next came question provisioning medicines one required careful consideration avoid lumbering wagon yet take everything absolutely necessary 
fortunately turned good bit doctor point previous career managed pass course medical surgical instruction less kept 
course qualified knows many man write md name found afterwards splendid traveling medicine chest set instruments 
whilst durban cut kafir big toe way pleasure see 
quite nonplussed kafir sat stolidly watching operation asked put another saying white one would pinch 
remained questions satisfactorily settled two important points consideration namely arms servants

one double central fire keeper shot gun full choke barrels 
gun proved greatest service us afterwards shooting game pot 
three winchester repeating rifles carbines spare guns 
three single action colt revolvers heavier american pattern cartridge 
total armament doubtless reader observe weapons class make calibre cartridges interchangeable important point 
make apology detailing length every experienced hunter know vital proper supply guns ammunition success expedition 
men go us 
much consultation decided number limited five namely driver leader three servants 
driver leader found without much difficulty two zulus named respectively goza tom get servants proved difficult matter 
necessary thoroughly trustworthy brave men business sort lives might depend upon conduct 
last secured two one hottentot named ventv gel windbird one little zulu named khiva merit speaking english perfectly 
ventv gel known one perfect spoorers game trackers ever tough whipcord 
never seemed tire 
one failing common race drink

encampment flowed little stream farther side stony slope twenty years seen poor silvestre creeping back attempt reach solomon mines beyond slope begins waterless desert covered species karoo shrub 
evening pitched camp great ball sun sinking desert sending glorious rays many colored light flying vast expanse

still ghastly sight one glad escape indeed never remember anything kind affected seeing gallant soldiers thus put pain red handed medicine men except indeed one occasion attack saw force swazis burying hopelessly wounded alive 
hurrying dreadful scene side koppie found sir henry still held battle axe hand ignosi infadoos one two chiefs deep consultation 
thank heaven quatermain quite make ignosi wants

thus adjured taking hasty counsel good sir henry delivered opinion briefly effect trapped best chance especially view failure water supply initiate attack upon twala forces 
recommended attack delivered wounds grew stiff also sight twala overpowering force caused hearts soldiers wax small like fat fire 
otherwise pointed captains might change minds making peace twala desert even betray us hands 
expression opinion seemed whole favourably received indeed among kukuanas utterances met respect never accorded since 
real decision plans lay ignosi since recognized rightful king could exercise almost unbounded rights sovereignty including course final decision matters generalship eyes turned 
length pause appeared thinking deeply spoke 
incubu macumazahn bougwan brave white men friends infadoos uncle chiefs heart fixed

ignosi thought might well proud man day roman emperor ever salutation gladiators die 
ignosi acknowledged magnificent act homage lifting battle axe greys filed triple line formation line containing one thousand fighting men exclusive officers 
last companies advanced five hundred yards ignosi put head buffaloes regiment drawn similar three fold formation gave word march went needless say uttering heartfelt prayers might emerge entertainment whole skin

hesitated finally stopped advance eagerness cross spears three grim ranks warriors stood firm ready 
presently however tall general wearing customary head dress nodding ostrich plumes appeared attended group chiefs orderlies thought none twala 
gave order first regiment raising shout charged towards greys remained perfectly still silent till attacking troops within forty yards volley tollas throwing knives came rattling among ranks 
suddenly bound roar sprang forward uplifted spears regiment met deadly strife 
next second roll meeting shields came ears like sound thunder plain seemed alive flashes light reflected shimmering spears 
fro swung surging mass struggling stabbing humanity long 
suddenly attacking lines began grow thinner slow long heave greys passed great wave heaves bulk passes sunken ridge 
done regiment completely destroyed greys two lines left third number dead

ignosi issued order rapidly passed ranks effect none enemy wounded killed far could see command scrupulously carried 
would shocking sight found time think things 
second regiment distinguished white plumes kilts shields moving attack two thousand remaining greys stood waiting ominous silence till foe within forty yards hurled irresistible force upon 
came awful roll meeting shields watched tragedy repeated 
time issue left longer doubt indeed seemed awhile almost impossible greys prevail 
attacking regiment formed young men fought utmost fury first seemed sheer weight driving veterans back 
slaughter truly awful hundreds falling every minute among shouts warriors groans dying set music clashing spears came continuous hissing undertone gee gee note triumph victor passed assegai body fallen foe 
perfect discipline steady unchanging valor wonders one veteran soldier worth two young ones soon became apparent present case 
thought greys preparing take place soon made room destroyed heard sir henry deep voice ringing din caught glimpse circling battle axe waved high plumes 
came change greys ceased give stood still rock furious waves spearmen broke recoil 
presently began move forward time firearms smoke could see 
another minute onslaught grew fainter 
ah men indeed conquer called ignosi grinding teeth excitement side

gallant triple line forty minutes gone action three thousand strong remained six hundred blood spattered men rest foot 
yet cheered waved spears triumph instead falling back upon us expected ran forward hundred yards flying groups foemen took possession rising knoll ground resuming triple formation formed threefold ring around base 
thanks heaven standing top mound minute saw sir henry apparently unharmed old friend infadoos 
twala regiments rolled upon doomed band battle closed 
read history probably long ago gathered honest bit coward certainly way given fighting though somehow often lot get unpleasant positions obliged shed man blood 
always hated kept blood undiminished quantity possible sometimes judicious use heels 
moment however first time life felt bosom burn martial ardor 
warlike fragments ingoldsby legends together numbers sanguinary verses old testament sprang brain like mushrooms dark blood hitherto half frozen horror went beating veins came upon savage desire kill spare 
glanced round serried ranks warriors behind us somehow instant began wonder face looked like 
stood hands twitching lips apart fierce features instinct hungry lust battle eyes look like glare bloodhound long pursuit sights quarry 
ignosi heart judge comparative self possession seemed appearances beat calmly ever beneath leopard skin cloak though even still ground teeth 
could bear longer 
stand till put roots umbopa ignosi mean twala swallows brothers yonder asked 
nay macumazahn answer see ripe moment let us pluck 
spoke fresh regiment rushed past ring upon little mound wheeling round attacked hither side 
lifting battle axe ignosi gave signal advance screaming wild kukuana war cry buffaloes charged home rush like rush sea 
followed immediately power tell 
remember irregular yet ordered advance seemed shake ground sudden change front forming part regiment charge directed awful shock dull roar voices continuous flashing spears seen red mist blood 
mind cleared found standing inside remnant greys near top mound behind less person sir henry

gallant sight see old warrior infadoos cool though parade shouting orders taunts even jests keep spirit remaining men charge rolled stepping forward wherever fighting thickest bear share repulse 
yet gallant vision sir henry whose ostrich plumes shorn spear thrust long yellow hair streamed breeze behind 
stood great dane nothing else hands axe armor red blood none could live stroke

suddenly rose cry twala twala press sprang forward none gigantic one eyed king also armed battle axe shield clad chain armor 
art thou incubu thou white man slewest scragga son see thou canst slay shouted time hurled tolla straight sir henry fortunately saw coming caught shield transfixed remaining wedged iron plate behind hide 
cry twala sprang forward straight battle axe struck blow upon shield mere force shock brought sir henry strong man upon knees 
time matter went instant rose regiments pressing round us something like shout dismay looking saw cause 
right left plain alive plumes charging warriors 
outflanking squadrons come relief 
time could better chosen 
twala army ignosi predicted would case fixed attention bloody struggle raging round remnant greys buffaloes carrying battle little distance two regiments formed chest army 
horns close upon dreamed approach believed forces hidden reserve upon crest moon shaped hill 
could even assume proper formation defense outflanking impis leapt like greyhounds flanks 
five minutes fate battle decided 
taken flanks dismayed awful slaughter inflicted upon greys buffaloes twala regiments broke flight soon whole plain us loo scattered groups running soldiers making good retreat 
hosts recently surrounded us buffaloes melted away though magic presently left standing like rock sea retreated 
sight around us dead dying lay heaped masses gallant greys remained ninety five men upon feet 
three thousand four hundred fallen one regiment never rise 
men said infadoos calmly intervals binding wound arm surveyed remained corps ye kept reputation regiment day fighting well spoken children children 
turned round shook sir henry curtis hand

arriving nearest gate loo found one regiments watching obedience orders received ignosi 
regiments way guarding different exits town 
officer command regiment saluted ignosi king informed twala army taken refuge town whither twala also escaped thought thoroughly demoralised would surrender 
thereupon ignosi taking counsel us sent forward heralds gate ordering defenders open promising royal word life forgiveness every soldier laid arms saying nightfall would certainly burn town within gates 
message without effect 
half hour later amid shouts cheers buffaloes bridge dropped across fosse gates upon side flung open 
taking due precautions treachery marched town 
along roadways stood thousands dejected warriors heads drooping shields spears feet headed officers saluted ignosi king passed 
marched straight twala kraal

luckily good decent surgeon soon small box medicines forthcoming thoroughly cleansed wounds managed stitch first sir henry pretty satisfactorily considering imperfect light given primitive kukuana lamp hut 
afterwards plentifully smeared injured places antiseptic ointment pot little box covered remains pocket handkerchief possessed 
meanwhile foulata prepared us strong broth weary eat 
swallowed threw piles magnificent karrosses fur rugs scattered dead king great hut 
strange instance irony fate twala couch wrapped twala particular karross sir henry man slain slept night 
say slept day work sleep indeed difficult 
begin truth air full farewells dying mournings dead 
every direction came sound wailing women whose husbands sons brothers perished battle 
wonder wailed twelve thousand men nearly fifth kukuana army destroyed awful struggle 
heart rending lie listen cries never would return made understand full horror work done day man ambition 
towards midnight however ceaseless crying women grew less frequent till length silence broken intervals minutes long piercing howl came hut immediate rear afterwards discovered proceeded gagool keening dead king twala

last somehow night passed away dawn broke found companions slept better 
good indeed high fever soon afterwards began grow light headed also alarm spit blood result doubt internal injury inflicted desperate efforts made kukuana warrior previous day force big spear chain armor 
sir henry however seemed pretty fresh notwithstanding wound face made eating difficult laughter impossibility though sore stiff could scarcely stir 
eight clock visit infadoos appeared little worse tough old warrior exertions battle although informed us night 
delighted see us much grieved good condition shook hands cordially 
noticed however addressed sir henry kind reverence though something man indeed afterwards found great englishman looked throughout kukuanaland supernatural 
man soldiers said could fought fought end day toil bloodshed could slain twala addition king supposed strongest warrior country single combat shearing bull neck stroke 
indeed stroke became proverbial kukuanaland extraordinary blow feat strength henceforth known incubu blow 
infadoos told us also twala regiments submitted ignosi like submissions beginning arrive chiefs outlying country

hour half tramped heather fringed way going fast excitement bearers gagool hammock could scarcely keep pace us occupant piped us stop 
walk slowly white men said projecting hideous shrivelled countenance grass curtains fixing gleaming eyes upon us ye run meet evil shall befall ye seekers treasure laughed horrible laugh always sent cold shiver back quite took enthusiasm us 
however went till saw us peak vast circular hole sloping sides three hundred feet depth quite half mile round

shook heads 
clear never seen diamond diggings kimberley

many places way surrounding road built entirely blocks stone apparently object supporting edges pit preventing falls reef 
along path pressed driven curiosity see three towering objects could discern hither side great gulf 
drew near perceived colossi sort another rightly conjectured us sat three silent ones held awe kukuana people 
quite close recognized full majesty silent ones 
upon huge pedestals dark rock sculptured rude emblems phallic worship separated distance forty paces looking road crossed sixty miles plain loo three colossal seated forms two male one female measuring thirty feet crown head pedestal 
female form nude great though severe beauty unfortunately features injured centuries exposure weather 
rising either side head points crescent 
two male colossi contrary draped presented terrifying cast features especially one right face devil 
left serene countenance calm upon seemed dreadful 
calm inhuman cruelty sir henry remarked ancients attributed beings potent good could yet watch sufferings humanity without rejoicing least without sorrow 
three statues form awe inspiring trinity sit solitude gaze across plain ever 
contemplating silent ones kukuanas call intense curiosity seized us know whose hands shaped dug pit made road 
whilst gazing wondering suddenly occurred familiar old testament solomon went astray strange gods names three remembered ashtoreth goddess zidonians chemosh god moabites milcom god children ammon suggested companions figures us might represent false exploded divinities 
hum said sir henry scholar taken high degree classics college may something ashtoreth hebrews astarte phoenicians great traders solomon time 
astarte afterwards became aphrodite greeks represented horns like half moon brow female figure distinct horns 
perhaps colossi designed phoenician official managed mines 
say finished examining extraordinary relics remote antiquity infadoos came saluted silent ones lifting spear asked us intended entering place death would wait till taken food mid day

gagool waiting us still evil grin upon horrid face 
white men stars piped great warriors incubu bougwan macumazahn wise ye ready behold bidding lord king show store bright stones

sometimes stalagmites took strange forms presumably dropping water always spot 
thus one huge mass must weighed hundred tons shape pulpit beautifully fretted outside design looked like lace 
others resembled strange beasts sides cave fanlike ivory tracings frost leaves upon pane 
vast main aisle opened smaller caves exactly sir henry said chapels open great cathedrals 
large one two wonderful instance nature carries handiwork unvarying laws utterly irrespective size tiny 
one little nook instance larger unusually big doll house yet might model whole place water dropped tiny icicles hung spar columns forming way 
however enough time examine beautiful cavern thoroughly liked since unfortunately gagool seemed indifferent stalactites anxious get business 
annoyed particularly anxious discover possible system light admitted cave whether hand man nature done also place used way ancient times seemed probable 
however consoled idea would investigate thoroughly way back followed heels uncanny guide 
led us straight top vast silent cave found another doorway arched first square top something like doorways egyptian temples 
ye prepared enter place death white men asked gagool evidently view making us feel uncomfortable 
lead macduff said good solemnly trying look though alarmed indeed except foulata caught good arm protection 
getting rather ghastly said sir henry peeping dark passageway

tap tap went old gagool stick passage trotted along chuckling hideously still overcome unaccountable presentiment evil hung back

thus adjured started passage twenty paces found gloomy apartment forty feet long thirty broad thirty high past age evidently hollowed hand labor mountain 
apartment nearly well lighted vast stalactite ante cave first glance could discern massive stone table running length colossal white figure head life sized white figures round

chapter xix ignosi farewell ten days eventful morning found us old quarters loo strange say little worse terrible experience except stubbly hair came treasure cave three shades greyer went good never quite foulata death seemed move greatly 
bound say looking thing point view oldish man world consider removal fortunate occurrence since otherwise complications would sure ensue 
poor creature ordinary native girl person great almost said stately beauty considerable refinement mind

good many fell course roll side pit including several big ones crammed top coat pockets 
comparatively speaking enormous quantity still remained including ninety three large stones ranging two hundred seventy carats weight 
old shooting coat basket still held sufficient treasure make us millionaires term understood america least exceedingly wealthy men yet keep enough stones make three finest sets gems europe
