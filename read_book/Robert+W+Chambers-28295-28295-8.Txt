colony la trappe far could judge product conditions hundred years culminated french revolution 
different circumstances france disintegrating socially 
opposition empire dynasty government seething years separate crystals formed edges boiling currents began grow masses adhering masses interfered healthy functions national life 
recently however among dissatisfied existed certain tendency towards cohesion moreover adhesive forces mutually impelled separate groups malcontents closer union government found nothing alarming menaces individuals isolated groups 
emperor always counted opposition paris palace tuileries practically besieged place menaced always faubourgs castle lay eternally sullen unorganized multitude municipal police kept watch 
opposition hatred treason existed never worried government opposition remain unorganized occupied authorities constantly 
groups individuals proclaimed devotees social theories interested us groups grew large exhibited tendencies unite similar groups 
clubs formed discuss social questions usually watched police violent organizations observed closely clubs founded upon moderate principles always closely surveyed 
faubourgs every street bawling orator red flag waved community become sufficiently drunk government quietly content ignore proceedings wisely understanding mouths street orators safety valves faubourgs ebullitions world escaped nothing serious vinous shrieks 
however certain secret semi secret organizations caused government concern 
first among came international society workingmen affiliations internationale called 
wake trailed minor societies mild harmless dangerous secret violent advocating openly destruction existing conditions 
small groups anarchists already attracted groups moderate socialistic tendencies absorbed tainted doctrines dangerous state

government watched 
presently split parties yet paradox revealed small party splitting two larger halves 
one halves adhered red republicans government opposition extreme left opportunists anarchists certain socialists called communards finally vast mass sullen teeming faubourgs 
became party closely affiliated internationale colossal restless unorganized menace harmless unorganized 
police expected keep harmless
