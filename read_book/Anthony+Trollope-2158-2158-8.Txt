chapter ii everett wharton day lopez dined friend everett wharton new club called progress members 
progress certainly new club yet open hardly three years still old enough seen many hopes early youth become dim age inaction 
progress intended great things liberal party rather political liberality general truth done little nothing 
got considerable enthusiasm certain fiery politicians believed instrumentality institution men genius spirit natural power without wealth meaning always would supplied sure seats parliament probable share government 
results achieved 
want something deficiency felt yet defined hitherto fatal 
young men said old stager knew way pulling wires would come forward put club proper groove 
old men said young men pretentious puppies 
however doubted party progress become slack liberal politicians country although special new club opened furtherance views present making much way 
want organization said one leading young men 
organization yet forthcoming 
club nevertheless went way like clubs men dined smoked played billiards pretended read 
energetic members still hoped good day would come grand ideas might realized regarded members generally content eat drink play billiards 
fairly good club sprinkling liberal lordlings couple dozen members parliament made believe would neglect party duties unless paid money usual assortment barristers attorneys city merchants idle men 
good enough rate ferdinand lopez particular dinner opinion wines 
heard assert real quiet comfort club london equal hearers aware past days blackballed g 
accidents lopez gift keeping background 
present companion everett wharton well original member wharton one hoped find club stepping stone high political life talked often idle energy need organization 
said lopez conceive vainer object ambition seat british parliament 
man gain successful work hard little pay thanks nearly equally hard pay little thanks 
many fail sit idly hours undergoing weary task listening platitudes enjoy return absolutely valueless privilege mp written letters 
somebody must make laws country 
see necessity 
think country would uncommonly well know old law would altered new law made next twenty years 
repealed corn laws corn laws repeal 
modify income tax would modify nothing 
rate whether laws altered left comfort need put finger pie 
one benefit indeed house 
arrested 
well far goes one 
assists man getting seat director certain companies 
people still asses trust board directors made members parliament therefore course members made welcome 
want get house arrange father instead waiting club may father pay shilling purpose 
never house 
therefore despises 
little perhaps 
man ever worked harder way successfully seen one another juniors become members parliament stuck attorneys perhaps little jealousy 
see way live home think father would anything proper management 
doubt suppose could afford father never life said anything money affairs though says great deal mine 
man ever closer father 
believe could afford almost anything 
wish father said ferdinand lopez 
think succeed ascertaining extent capabilities making use 
wharton nearly asked friend almost summoned courage ask whether father done much 
intimate one subject lopez much interested confidence close 
younger weaker man two could quite bring point making inquiry thought would disagreeable 
lopez never intercourse hinted possibility filial aspirations 
though created self sufficient independent mother milk father money 
question might asked almost naturally 
asked 
everett wharton trouble father agonizing trouble sons 
faults nature rob father cup sweetness bring gray hairs sorrow grave 
old wharton never ask whether length let son fall lowest abysses whether yet struggle put legs forgive pay debts endeavor forget dishonor place score thoughtless youth 
think first second fall certainly third young man would gone abyss mr wharton stern man capable coming clear conclusion things nearest even dearest 
everett wharton simply shown inefficient earn bread 
never declined even simply inefficient 
declared either words actions father rich man son would therefore nothing 
tried hand thrice case short trial assured father friends thing suited 
leaving oxford without degree reading schools suit gone banking house means mere clerk expressed proposition father backed assent partner work way wealth great commercial position 
six months taught banking abomination went course reading barrister 
remained till called man may called little continuous work 
called solitude chambers much twenty five found stock exchange mart world talents energies possessed 
nature failure year went city known father unless ferdinand lopez knew something also 
six twenty stock exchange also abandoned eight twenty everett wharton discovered parliamentary career nature special genius intended 
probably suggested father met cold rebuff 
everett wharton good looking manly fellow six feet high broad shoulders light hair wearing large silky bushy beard made look older years neither speech appearance would ever taken fool showed actions body well play face lacked firmness purpose 
certainly fool 
read much though generally forgot read left readings certain nebulous lights begotten men thinking enabled talk subjects 
said much thinking thought thought 
believed gone rather deep politics entitled call many statesmen asses see things saw 
great question labor refers unions strikes lock outs quite fingers ends 
knew church england disestablished recomposed 
quite clear questions finance saw progress made towards communism violence disturb progress due course centuries desire personal property conquered annihilated philanthropy general hardly accounted virtue 
meantime could never contrive pay tailor bill regularly allowance year father made always dreaming comforts handsome income 
popular man certainly popular women always courteous generally liked men genial good natured 
though aware fact dear father silent way almost admired certainly liked openness guileless freedom character opposite 
father though never said word flatter son truth give offspring credit greater talent possessed even appearing scorn would listen young man diatribes almost satisfaction 
everett dear also sister living member branch wharton family 
much said pages hoped reader may take interest fate 
speaking brother may suffice say sister endowed infinitely finer gifts give credit somewhat pretentious claims less noble brother 
indeed perhaps misfortune everett wharton people believed misfortune others thought worth pretend believe 
among latter might probably reckoned friend dining progress 
man may flatter another lopez occasionally flatter wharton without preconcerted falsehood 
suits one man well another one learns gradually perhaps unconsciously way take advantage foibles 
material lopez stand well members wharton family aspired hand daughter house 
regard already thought nearly sure 
father sanction marriage reason almost doubtful 
brother friend circumstances man almost justified flattering brother 
tell lopez said wharton strolled club together little ten clock men present day give trouble occupy minds matters real interest 
pope knew said proper study mankind man 
people read pope take trouble understand 
men busy making money dear fellow 

money nice thing 
nice said lopez 
search debasing 
man could make money four six even eight hours day wash mind pursuit clerk office washes copies ledgers mind would never make money way keep 
therefore whole thing debasing 
man ceases care great interests world even aware existence whole soul spanish bonds 
wanted make banker found would kill 
would kill think confine spanish bonds 
know mean 
rate understand though fear far gone abandon idea making fortune 
would abandon morrow could come fortune ready made 
man must rate eat 
yes must eat 
quite sure said wharton thoughtfully need think eats 
unless beef sent without horse radish happened two men sat dinner insufficient quantity vegetable supplied steward club consumed wharton complained grievance 
man right paid said wharton mock solemnity passes laches nature without observation injury humanity large 
going caught trap know like horse radish beef 
well go farther way deal reading court morpheus 
take advice go straight governor 
whatever emily may feel think say much encourage unless go fashion 
prim notions perhaps much amiss man wants marry girl 
god forbid think anything sister amiss think much 
women generally superficial honestly superficial dishonestly 
emily rate honest 
stop half moment 
sauntered arm arm broad pavement leading pall mall duke york column 
wish could make father clearly 
always civil cold way looking makes think good books 
like everybody 
never seem get beyond skin 
must heard speak absence never says much anybody 
word would let know land lies 
know well enough aware last man curious others think 
indeed care much man 
utterly indifferent opinion world large would never object company pleasant person pleasant person abused behind back 
value pleasantness man liking disliking 
dearest aim life concerned might guided either way great advantage knowing whether stand well ill 
dined three times within last three months manchester square know man certainly young man strong proof intimacy father 
yes know advantages 
friend 
care twopence friends 
wanted give charlie skate dinner father price 
charlie skate elbows bets billiards 
respectable rate father thinks 
father anxious aware wishes make house pleasant long advantage 
far concerned rather approves fancying turn making money stronger turn spending 
nevertheless looks upon friend rather 
though given three dinners three months greatness hospitality suppose ever said word favor 
wish knew say 
says knows nothing 
oh know harm 
next says ask many men dine house say much 
good night keep longer 
tell us manage handle rightly may get seat parliament may get wife course 
parted lopez remained pathway walking side old military club thinking things 
certainly knew friend younger wharton intimately appreciating man good qualities fully aware man weakness 
questions extracted quite enough assure emily father would adverse proposition 
felt much doubt certain 
know much said musing 
well much tell 
course wise wisdom goes 
wise men foolish things intervals 
discreetest city bankers talked money scrupulous matrons talked virtue experienced statesmen talked principles 
really calculate chances men lead forlorn hopes generally push without wounded fifth sixth heir comes title 
much said palpably though inner voice 
impalpably even inner voice asked chance might prevailing girl almost ventured tell direction need despair 
truth loved girl reverenced believing better higher nobler human beings man love believing doubts success reverence produces 
chapter iii mr abel wharton qc lopez man let grass grow feet anything 
tired walking backwards forwards bit pavement subject cold east wind went home thought matter lay bed 
even get girl assurances love without father consent might find farther object ever 
mr wharton man old fashions would think ill used daughter ill used would think also general offence would committed good social manners daughter asked hand without previous consent 
absolutely refuse battle though would desperate battle might perhaps fought strategy giving matter best consideration lopez thought expedient go father 
would silly tremors 
whatever might feel speaking girl sufficient self confidence able ask father assurance rate without trepidation 
thought probable father first attack would neither altogether accede altogether refuse 
disposition man averse probability absolute reply first moment 
lover imagined might possible take advantage period doubt would thus created 
mr wharton great many years barrister practising equity courts rather one equity court throughout life work extending nearly fifty years hardly ever gone single vice chancellor court much better known mr wharton name less eminent judge sat 
peculiar toilsome yet probably satisfactory life 
begun practice early worked stuff gown till nearly sixty 
time amassed large fortune mainly profession partly also careful use small patrimony wife money 
men knew rich one knew extent wealth 
submitted take silk gown declared among friends step preparatory retirement 
altered method work would suit age said would profitable 
would take silk honor declining years might become bencher inn 
working last twelve fourteen years silk gown almost hard younger days pecuniary results almost serviceable though month month declared intention taking fresh briefs though occasionally refuse work still mind clear ever body apparently little affected fatigue 
mr wharton married till forty wife two years dead 
six children two left make household old age 
nearly fifty youngest daughter born therefore old father young child 
one men youth never young age never old 
could still ride cob park jauntily carefully every morning life early cup tea breakfast 
could walk home chambers every day sundays could round parks foot 
twice week wednesdays saturdays dined old law club eldon played whist dinner till twelve clock 
great dissipation think chief charm life 
middle august daughter usually went month wharton hall herefordshire seat cousin sir alured wharton one duty life burthen 
made believe essential health wife girl health every summer leave town time else go sir alured relation gentleman 
emily liked wharton hall 
proper thing 
hated wharton hall know place london would hate worse 
induced go rhine never repeated experiment foreign travel 
emily sometimes went abroad cousins periods supposed old lawyer spent good deal time eldon 
spare thin strongly made man spare light brown hair hardly yet grizzled small gray whiskers clear eyes bushy eyebrows long ugly nose young barristers heard declare might hang small kettle considerable vehemence talk opposed argument 
well known coolness temper mr wharton could become hot argument nature case hand required heat 
one subject knew agreed 
thorough lawyer 
many doubted eloquence declared known well extent powers abstaining seeking higher honors profession one doubted law 
written book mortgage stocks trade early life never since dabbled literature 
certainly man men generally afraid 
whist table one would venture scold 
court one ever contradicted 
house though quiet servants dreaded offend attentive slightest behests 
condescended ride acquaintance park always acknowledged old wharton regulate pace 
name abel life known able abe silent far seeing close fisted old man however means deficient sympathy either sufferings joys humanity 
easter time courts sitting mr wharton chamber matter course ten clock 
knew real homely comforts elsewhere unless whist table eldon 
ate drank slept house manchester square could hardly said live 
mind awake powers man exercised 
came dining room join daughter dinner would get sing song would seat book 
never read house invariably falling sweet placid slumber never disturbed till daughter kissed went bed 
would walk room look watch shuffle uneasily half hour till conscience allowed take chamber 
man pursuits house 
ten morning till five often till six evening mind active work 
law used 
drawer old piece furniture stood right hand arm chair various books hidden away sometimes ashamed seen clients poetry novels even fairy tales 
nothing mr wharton could read chambers though nothing could read house 
large pleasant room sit looking ground floor stone buildings gardens belonging inn center metropolis perfect quiet far outside world concerned lived still lived life 
noon day following lopez made sudden swoop mr parker dined everett wharton called stone buildings shown lawyer room 
quick eye discovered book mr wharton half hid away saw upon mr mudie suspicious ticket 
barristers certainly never get law books mudie lopez knew hoped father law reading novel 
suspected weakness argued well business hand 
must soft spot found heart old lawyer spent mornings occupation 
sir said mr wharton rising seat 
hope see well sir 
though reading novel tone manner cold 
lopez never stone buildings quite sure might committed offence coming 
take seat mr lopez 
anything way great deal could done way father introduced case made clear lopez know whether old man yet ever suspected feeling intended declare 
intimate house manchester square certainly ingratiated closely certain mrs roby mrs wharton sister constant companion lived berkeley street close round corner manchester square spent much time emily wharton 
together daily though mrs roby assumed part second mother lopez well aware mrs roby knew love 
real confidence mrs roby old lawyer old lawyer must know also lopez felt dark 
task speaking old father unpleasant lover knows smiled upon fact approved last six months 
going patted back made much received family 
told mary augusta best daughter world therefore certainly best wife probably special occasion spoken unqualified praise pleasant 
subject one difficult broach previous light thrown 
ferdinand lopez however man stand shivering brink plunge necessary therefore made plunge 
mr wharton taken liberty call upon want speak daughter 
daughter old man surprise quite genuine 
course given moment think knew must nature visitor communication 
moment never mixed daughter ferdinand lopez thoughts together 
idea come upon looked aspirant severe unpleasant eyes 
manifest aspirant first flash thing painful father

hardly possible learned love without consciousness part 
mean without beating bush making love say making love consists mr wharton sir gentleman knows

endeavored commend daughter never spoken word love 
everett know yes 
encouraged knows intimate friend 
whoever lady might told 
attached would think account object call brother 
spoke yesterday matter plainly told ought certainly see first 
quite agreed therefore 
certainly nothing conduct make angry think anything mine 
dignity demeanor quiet assured courage effect upon old lawyer 
felt could storm talk ambiguous language gentleman would would

daughter happiness serious consideration people among confess one consider like marry like 
wish see daughter marry sphere neither higher lower one class

portuguese 
admitting thus subjecting one clearly stated ground objection objection one though admitted carried neither fault disgrace lopez felt got certain advantage

mother english lady added father certainly englishman 
never common happiness knowing either 
orphan understood parent 
said pathos moment stopped expression harsh criticism lawyer 
mr wharton could instantly repeat objection parentage matter melancholy reflections felt time luckily landed positive undeniable ground objection match distasteful would unwise go matters might less successful 
would seem abandon ground already made good 
thought probable man might adequate income yet wish welcome son law 
thought possible portuguese father might portuguese nobleman therefore one would driven admit sort gentleman yet man presence continued scan closest observation called gentleman 
foreign blood proved would suffice 
looked lopez thought detected jewish signs afraid make allusion religion lest lopez declare ancestors noted christians since st james first preached peninsula

course prejudice 
deny general subjects give much latitude man one hearth attacked surely proposition mine mr wharton attack sense 
man proposes assault invade kernel another man heart share indeed take dearest possessions become part parcel either infinite good infinite evil man right guard even prejudices precious bulwarks

chapter vi old friend goes windsor going make question asked husband lady perhaps readers volume may already formed acquaintance 
chronicles early life written rate copiously 
lady duchess omnium husband course duke 
order nature question asked duchess may explained must stated time political affairs nation got tied one truly desperate knots even wisdom experience septuagenarian statesmen see unravelment 
heads parties standstill 
house commons say majority either side 
minds members astray according best calculation could made would majority ten possible cabinet 
would certainly majority either well tried moment little trusted prime ministers mr gresham mr daubeny 
certain men nominally belonging party would certainly within week nomination cabinet house oppose cabinet ought support 
mr daubeny power nay power though twice resigned 
mr gresham twice sent windsor one occasion undertaken another refused undertake form ministry 
mr daubeny tried two three combinations wits end 
doubt still power could appoint bishops make peers give away ribbons 
pass law certainly continued hold present uncomfortable position 
prime minister escape till succeeded finding successor though successor found consents make attempt old unfortunate allowed go free attempt shown failure 
absolutely given keys boxes one take 
even sovereign abdicate prime minister constitutional government bonds 
reader may therefore understand duchess asking husband place among political rulers country offered last aspirant leadership government 
reader understand may perhaps ever seen former chronicles allusion made 
duke became duke held high office chancellor exchequer 
transferred perforce house lords uncommon cases accepted lower political station 
displeased duchess ambitious behalf lord thought duke omnium nothing government rate near top 
simple single object special piece work nation something fancied nobody else would grace motion solicitation encountered official degradation much disgust duchess 
way grace hide sorrows depth bosom 
affronted would speak whether husband another using irony rather argument support cause vindicate ways 
shafts ridicule hurled husband regard voluntary abasement many sharp 
stung never moment influenced

nature say things knew came rather uncontrolled spirit malice 
wife idea little injuries sort end bearing part husband 
sometimes would endeavor explain motives actuated come fear must ever unintelligible 
credited less real intelligence

surely said man rank minister great minister rate great circumstances make 
man never save country degrading 
would probably agreed idea degradation hardly tallied 
therefore asked going make though sarcastic housekeeper great establishment ask butler butler prone yield matters whether master appointed lately cleaning shoes carrying coals 
since knots become tight since journeys windsor become frequent grace asked many questions received indifferent replies 
duke sometimes declared matter ripe enough allow make answer
