little hoped worked things differently 
hope 
ruin life could explain strange agitation steele way except realization brought keen suffering incomprehensible painful 
could tell came suddenly divined love diane sampson equally poignant conviction fate wreck 
see needed speak brutal truth 
steele old man ruin diane sampson arrest looks improbable kill father 
god say sampson leader linrock gang rustlers 
night parted gone rather deeply plan action immediate future

got shot fair encounter enemies well ranger risk disgrace 
massacred bed knifed dark shot back ambushed manner one miserable ends must last record vaughn steele 
promised way made wonder would ever sleep turn back anyone made wonder menace voice 
steele seemed likely torn two ways already hint future desperation 
agreed make cautious advances hoden morton could satisfy trustworthiness reveal identity 
cultivate zimmer ranchers decide could let secret 
imperative learn clues might eventually fix guilt rustler gang also imperative develop band deputies help us fight began 
steele back linrock would center stage eyes upon 
agreed moreover bolder front better chance ultimate success 
nerve showed less danger ambushed less peril facing vicious men 
needed jail 
prisoners corraled arrest work would useless almost farce possibility repeating trips del rio 
could use adobe house jail could easily cut torn 
finally remembered old stone house near end main street one window one door long disuse 
steele would rent hire men guard feed prisoners prisoners bribed fought way freedom would injure great principle stood 
steele simultaneously different angles reasoning arrived conviction sampson guilt 
strong realization rather divination 
long experience detecting feeling hidden guilt men sharpened senses particular thing 
steele acknowledged mistakes day allowing strength conviction never made single mistake 
conviction one thing proof vastly another 
furthermore proof secured came crowning task taking desperate men wild country dominated 
verily steele work cut us 
however prepared go infinite patience implacable resolve 
steele differed driving incentive course outside one binding vow save ranger service 
strange passion almost obsession represent law texas render something safety happiness honest pioneers 
beside steele knew shrunk shadow 
exactly heathen certainly wanted help harassed people especially women children mainly zest thrill hazard matching wits word adventure game 
next morning rode young ladies 
light sally persistently flagrant advances apparently blind saw hard victory self likely short lived 
possibility made outwardly like ice 
attentive careful reliable respectful attendant seeing safety charges one time gay debonair cowboy thing past 
sally womanlike little little repentant showed indifference piqued made advances coldness roused spirit 
kind girl value lost throw consequences winds winning back 
divined saw revenge 
sure thought reason want revenge 
gracious 
catty thing said kissed admirers 
seriousness sentiment aside dared make 
cold indifferent part played imperative 
halted ridge dismounted usual little rest 
mine took shade scrubby mesquite 
girls strolled away sight 
drowsy day nearly fell asleep 
something aroused patter footsteps rustle skirts 
soft thud behind gave start thrill 
first saw sally little brown hands shoulders 
head hair shiny flying fragrant came round shoulder softly smoothing cheek sweet saucy heated face right eyes 
russ love whispered 
chapter steele breaks party night saw steele meeting place compared notes pondered details problem 
steele rented stone house used jail

white dress never seen low neck short sleeves looked sweet dainty altogether desirable groaned hundred times jealousy 
manifestly sally intend run risk seeing glory matter eyes looked 
couple times promenading passed arm proud cowboy gallant young buck town occasions favored escort languishing glance probably much damage 
presently caught red handed careless sauntering pursuit whether intent indifference apparently deigned notice 
quick feel difference marked moment gaiety gradually merged coquettishness soon flirtation 
see far would go perhaps desperately hoping would make hate followed shamelessly patio parlor porch court even waltz 
credit always weakened young fellow got corner tried push flirting extremes 
young waters one lucky enough kiss strength conquest decent fellow could proud 
george wright sought sally added jealousy real anxiety 
brushed wright evening

music recommenced went back house 
wright danced sally ungracefully man rode horse much 
dance waved aside sally many partners gaily would consistent good feeling led away

wright returned standing cigarette lips door leading patio
