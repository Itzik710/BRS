worse 
king napolyon going help elmersans gotten command 
late 
picked cane used push feet 
broken leg mended still weak 
took tottering steps paused lean cane forced open window stood moment staring 
turned 
captain harkaman might could still get command gram 
mind commanding owner aboard 
going hunting andray dunnan 
looked 
moment harkaman said count honor lord trask 
get ship half finished 
already crew 
duke angus finish pay pledging new barony traskon 
known rovard grauffis life moment never seen duke angus henchman show surprise 
mean trade traskon ship demanded 
finished equipped ready space yes 
duke agree grauffis said promptly 
lucas traskon 
ship need 
turning space viking 
brought harkaman feet roar approval 
grauffis looked mouth slightly open 
lucas trask space viking said 
heard everything 
well deplored effects viking raiding sword worlds gram sword world traskon gram traskon home elaine would live children children children would born live 
little point rested gone 
another lucas trask rovard 
dead 
vi grauffis excused make screen call returned excuse 
evidently duke angus dropped whatever soon heard henchman tell 
harkaman silent room said lord trask wonderful thing 
pleasant shipless captain living strangers bounty 
hate though think time advanced fortunes expense 
worry 
anybody taken advantage 
need space captain misfortune good luck 
harkaman started pack tobacco pipe 
ever gram asked 
years university camelot excalibur 
otherwise well conception sort thing setting space viking snapped lighter puffed 
know course big old federation 
know figures mean anything know good many spacemen even 
talk glibly ten hundredth power emotionally still count one two three many 
ship hyperspace logs light year hour 
go excalibur thirty hours 
could send radio message announcing birth son father received 
old federation going hunt dunnan occupies space volume two hundred billion cubic light years 
hunting one ship one man 
going lord trask started thinking know 
planets old federation space vikings come go raid trade bases like one duke angus planned establish tanith 
one another pick word dunnan sooner later 
hear year ago time get gone year half two years 
raiding old federation three hundred years lord trask 
present say least two hundred space viking ships operation 
raided bare long ago well answer distance voyage time 
know dunnan could die old age usual cause death among space vikings caught 
youngest ship boy could die old age found 
well go hunting till die 
nothing else means anything 
thought something like 
life 
want ship like corisande lost durendal 
day one 
till command ship command 
promise 
note ceremony seemed indicated 
summoning robot pour wine pledged 
rovard grauffis recovered aplomb time returned accompanied duke 
angus ever lost gave indication 
effect everybody else literally seismic 
generally accepted view lord trask reason unhinged tragic loss might conceded crumb truth 
first cousin nikkolay raged alienating barony family learned duke angus appointing vicar baron giving traskon new house residence 
immediately began acting like one death bed rich grandmother 
wardshaven financial industrial barons known distantly hand came flocking around offering assistance hailing savior duchy 
duke angus credit almost obliterated loss enterprise firmly established 
conferences lawyers bankers argued interminably attended first found completely uninterested told everybody 
wanted ship best ship possible soon possible 
alex gorram first notified commenced work unfinished sister ship enterprise immediately 
strong enough go shipyard watched work two thousand foot globular skeleton screen conferred either person screen engineers shipyard executives 
rooms ducal palace converted almost overnight sickrooms offices 
doctors recently urging find new interests activities warning dangers overexertion 
harkaman finally added voice 
take easy lucas 
dropped formality first name basis 
got hulled pretty badly let damage control work strain machinery till fixed 
plenty time 
going get anywhere chasing dunnan 
way catch interception 
longer moves around old federation hears trail leave 
establish predictable pattern chance 
time come hyperspace somewhere find us waiting 
think went tanith harkaman heaved chair prowled room minutes came back sat 

duke angus idea 
put base tanith anyhow 
know kind crew 
extensive inquiry dunnan associates accomplices duke angus still hoping positive proof implicate omfray glaspyth piracy 
dunnan dozen half employees gorram shipyards corrupted 
technical ability among part agitators trouble makers incompetent workmen 
even circumstances alex gorram glad see last 
dunnan mercenary company score former spacemen among rest graded bandits thugs sneak thieves barroom bums 
dunnan astrogator engineer 
gang even good enough routine raiding harkaman said 
never circumstances able put base tanith 
unless dunnan completely crazy doubt gone regular viking base planet like hoth nergal dagon xochitl recruit officers engineers able spacemen 
machinery robotic equipment going tanith aboard took ship yes another reason go planet like hoth nergal xochitl 
viking occupied planet old federation stuff almost worth weight gold 
tanith like almost completely terra type third class g sun 
much like haulteclere flamberge 
one last planets federation colonized big war 
nobody knows happened exactly 
interstellar war least find big slag puddles cities used 
probably lot fighting among got federation 
still traces combat damage around 
started decivilize pre mechanical level wind water power animal power 
draft animals look like introduced terran carabaos small sailboats big canoes bateaux rivers 
gunpowder seems last thing people lose 
five years ago 
liked tanith base 
one moon almost solid nickel iron fissionable ore deposits 
like fool hired elmersans durendal lost ship 
came duke thinking xipototec 
convinced tanith better planet purpose 
dunnan might go 
might think scoring one duke angus 
equipment 
nobody use 
dunnan go nergal xochitl 
always couple thousand space vikings either spending loot taking easy raids 
could sign full crew either 
suggest go xochitl first 
might pick news nothing else 
right try xochitl first 
harkaman knew planet friendly haulteclere noble ruled 
work went gorram shipyard taken year build enterprise steel mills engine works preparatory work tooling material equipment flowing steady stream 
lucas let persuade take rest day day grew stronger 
soon spending time shipyard watching engines go abbot lift drive normal space dillingham hyperdrive power converters pseudograv center globular ship 
living quarters workshops went next armored collapsium plated steel 
ship lifted orbit thousand miles planet followed swarms armored work craft cargo lighters rest work easily done space 
time four two hundred foot pinnaces would carried aboard finished 
hyperdrive engines could travel far fast ship 
otto harkaman beginning distressed ship still lacked name 
like speak ship many things soon go name marked 
elaine trask thought almost rejected 
want name associated things ship would old federation 
revenge avenger retribution vendetta none appealed 
news commentator turgidly eloquent nemesis criminal dunnan invoked supplied nemesis 
studying new profession interstellar robbery murder inveighed 
otto harkaman handful followers became teachers 
vann larch guns missiles also painter guatt kirbey sour pessimistic hyperspatial astrogator tried express science music sharll renner normal space astrogator 
alvyn karffard exec harkaman longest 
sir paytrik morland local recruit formerly guard captain count lionel newhaven commanded ground fighters combat contragravity 
using farms villages traskon drill practice noticed nemesis would carry five hundred ground air fighters thousand trained 
commented rovard grauffis 
yes 
mention outside duke henchman said

crazy trying apply sane logic guatt kirbey said 
figuring crazy 
course doubts times yes crazy captain harkaman allowing rovard grauffis said 
dunnan hates us 
hates grace

gold 
yes 
lothar ffayle found lot gold transferred dunnan banks glaspyth didreksburg grauffis said

go first 
vii outside viewscreen vacantly gray three thousand hours vertiginous swirl color indescribable color collapsing hyperspatial field 
two observers ever saw alike imagination could vision actuality 
trask found holding breath 
noticed otto harkaman beside 
something evidently nobody got used 
even guatt kirbey astrogator sitting pipe clenched mouth staring screen 
instant stars literally filled screen blaze splendor black velvet backdrop normal space 
dead center brighter rest ertado star sun tanith burned yellowly 
light ten hours old 
pretty good guatt harkaman said picking cup 
good gehenna perfect somebody else said 
kirbey relighting pipe 
oh suppose grudged around stem 
gray hair untidy mustache nothing ever quite good enough satisfy 
could made little closer 
need three microjumps cut last one pretty fine 
bother 
began punching buttons data fiddling setscrews verniers 
moment screen trask could see face andray dunnan 
blinked away reached cigarettes put one mouth wrong end

otto harkaman must seen

others seemed thought way 
battle stations board solid blaze red light full combat readiness

think make one microjump 
time trask supposed able use expression micro distance fifty five million miles 
think harkaman asked deferentially though seeking expert guidance instead examining apprentice 
guatt put us close possible course 
would light second least nemesis came hyperspace closer anything size tanith collapsing field would kick back 
assume dunnan least nine hundred hours 
time could put detection station maybe missile launchers moon 
enterprise carries four pinnaces nemesis place least two planet patrol 
let accept detected soon come last jump come moon directly us planet 
occupied knock way 
lot captains would try come moon masked planet harkaman said

go straight 
hearing guatt yeah 
makes sense 
sort 
stop pestering 
sharll look minute

ship property private adventure lord trask 
enterprise looking owned commanded one andray dunnan 
man scarred face hairy chest picked cigar puffing mechanically 
took mouth though wondered gotten first place 
duke wardshaven sending ship establish base heard 
heard gone flamberge gram command

two thousand hours ago gilgamesher brought news xochitl 
well considering fifth sixth hand information good enough fresh 
year half old got though

harkaman clucked sadly 
pity wasted time 
well nice talking boake 
say hello garvan comes 
mean staying valkanhayn horrified odd reaction man expecting bitter battle drive away 
spacing right harkaman shrugged 
want waste time lord trask enterprise obviously gone somewhere else 
still hyperspace captain valkanhayn accomplice arrived 
anything worth staying seemed reply harkaman expecting 
beside poultry harkaman shook head 
captain valkanhayn planet captain spasso let stuck 
look good planet 
big local city maybe ten twenty thousand people temples palaces everything 
couple old federation cities

well make kind deal valkanhayn asked 
mendicant whine beginning creep voice 
get garvan screen switch ship well lot sword world merchandise aboard harkaman said 
could make good prices 
fixed robotic equipment going stay valkanhayn almost panic 
listen suppose talk garvan get together 
excuse minute soon blanked harkaman threw back head guffawed though heard funniest bawdiest joke galaxy 
trask feel like laughing 
humor escapes admitted 
came fools errand 
sorry lucas 
harkaman still shaking mirth 
know letdown pair chiseling chicken thieves could almost pity funny 
laughed 
know idea trask shook head 
called couple chicken thieves 
raid planets like set hertha melkarth locals anything fight anything worth fighting 
know teamed figures 
nobody else would team either 
must happened story duke angus tanith adventure must filtered thought got first think cheaper take run 
probably would 
ships sort raid fashion 
going tanith base good planet stuck 
make anything like harkaman hooted 
equipment men 
job like 
thing space forget 
could sell equipment 
could anything use money 
one thing want let give men chance walk ground look sky 
girls bad either harkaman said 
remember even take bath 
kind news dunnan going get 
time get reported couple thousand light years away said disgustedly 
agree ought give men chance get ship 
stall pair along trouble 
three ships slowly converging toward point fifteen thousand miles planet sunset line 
space scourge bore device mailed fist clutching comet head looked like whisk broom scourge 
lamia bore coiled snake head arms bust woman 
valkanhayn spasso taking time screening back began wonder maneuvering nemesis cross fire position 
mentioned harkaman alvyn karffard laughed 
illustration holding ship meetings karffard said 
yakking back forth couple hours yet 
yes valkanhayn spasso ships harkaman explained 
gone debt crews supplies maintenance till everybody owns everything common 
ships look like 
even command really preside elected command councils 
finally less commanders screen 
valkanhayn zipped shirt put jacket 
garvan spasso small man partly bald 
eyes shade close together thin mouth bitterly crafty twist 
began speaking captain boake tells say service duke wardshaven 
said aggrievedly 
correct harkaman said 
came lord trask thought another gram ship enterprise would 
since point 
hope though make difficulty letting giving men couple hundred hours liberty 
hyperspace three thousand hours 
see spasso clamored 
wants trick us letting land illustration captain spasso trask cut 
please stop insulting everybody intelligence included 
spasso glared belligerently hopefully 
understand thought going 
expected captain harkaman establish base duke wardshaven thought ahead posture defense take duke service rather waste ammunition risk damage casualties wiping 
well sorry gentlemen 
captain harkaman service least interested establishing base tanith 
valkanhayn spasso looked 
least two side side screens eyes shifted screen ship 
get spasso cried suddenly 
two ships enterprise one 
duke wardshaven fitted enterprise somebody else fitted one 
want put base opened glorious vista 
instead merely capitalizing nuisance value might find holding balance power struggle planet 
sorts profitable perfidies possible 
sure land otto valkanhayn said 
know like three thousand hours hyper 
old city two tall tower buildings harkaman asked 
looked viewscreen 
ought midnight 
spaceport pretty bad 
oh fixing 
got big gang locals working us city familiar otto harkaman descriptions pictures vann larch painted long jump gram 
came looked impressive spreading miles around twin buildings spired almost three thousand feet great spaceport like eight pointed star one side 
whoever built sunset splendor old terran federation must done confident would become metropolis populous prospering world 
sun federation gone 
nobody knew happened tanith evidently none good 
first two towers seemed sound built gradually became apparent one broken top 
part smaller buildings scattered widely around standing though mounds brush grown rubble showed fallen 
spaceport looked good central octagon mass buildings landing berths beyond triangular areas airship docks warehouses 
central building outwardly intact ship berths seemed clear wreckage rubble 
time nemesis following space scourge lamia towed pinnaces illusion approaching living city vanished 
interspaces buildings choked forest growth broken small fields garden plots 
one time three high buildings literally vertical cities 
third stood glazed crater ridge fallen rubble lying away 
somebody must landed medium missile twenty kilotons base 
something sort scored far edge spaceport one eight arrowheads docks warehouses indistinguishable slag pile 
rest city seemed died neglect rather violence 
certainly bombed 
harkaman thought fighting done subneutron bombs omega ray bombs killed people without damaging real estate 
bio weapons man made plague gotten control depopulated planet 
takes awful lot people working together awful lot jobs keep civilization running 
smash installations kill top technicians scientists masses know rebuild go back stone hatchets 
kill enough masses even planet know left nobody work 
seen planets decivilized ways 
tanith think one latter 
one long dinner bull sessions way gram 
somebody one noble gentlemen adventurers joined company piracy enterprise murder asked survived 
know happened old times sorcerers 
built old buildings wizard arts 
sorcerers fought among went away harkaman said 
know 
could make kind explanation 
pinnaces pulled nudged nemesis berth could see people far spaceport floor work 
either valkanhayn spasso men size ships indicated gotten lot locals work 
population moribund city least harkaman remembered 
five hundred lived mining old buildings metal trading metalwork food textiles powder things made elsewhere 
accessible oxcarts traveling hundred miles across plains built contragravity using people utter disregard natural travel transportation routes 
envy poor buggers harkaman said looking antlike figures spaceport floor 
boake valkanhayn garvan spasso probably made slaves lot 
really going put base thank pair kind public relations work among locals 
ix situation 
spasso valkanhayn officers met landing stage big building middle spaceport established quarters 
entering going long hallway passed dozen men women gathering rubbish floor shovels hands putting lifter skid 
sexes wore shapeless garments coarse cloth like ponchos flat soled sandals 
watching another local kilt buskins leather jerkin wore short sword belt carried wickedly thonged whip 
also wore space viking combat helmet painted device spasso lamia 
bowed approached putting hand forehead 
passed could hear shouting others sound whip blows 
make slaves people always slave drivers bow take others 
harkaman nose twitching though bit rotten fish caught mustache 
eight hundred 
three hundred good work gathered rest villages along big river spasso saying 
get food harkaman asked 
bother oh gather valkanhayn told 
send parties landing craft 
let village run locals gather around bring 
put fight best crossbows muzzle loading muskets 
burn village machine gun everybody see 
stuff harkaman approved 
cow want milked shoot 
course get much milk room hosts guided far end hall 
probably conference room something sort originally paneled paneling long ago vanished 
holes dug walls remembered noticed door gone metal groove slid pried 
big table middle chairs couches covered colored spreads 
furniture handmade cunningly pegged together highly polished 
walls hung trophies weapons thrusting spears throwing spears crossbows quarrels number heavy guns crude things carefully made 
pick stuff locals harkaman asked 
yes got big town forks river valkanhayn said 
shook couple times 
recruited fellows using boss workers 
picked stick leather covered knob beat gong bawling wine 
voice somewhere replied yes master come moments woman entered carrying jug either hand 
wearing blue bathrobe several sizes large instead poncho things slaves hallway wore 
dark brown hair gray eyes obviously frightened would beautiful 
set jugs table brought silver cups chest wall spasso dismissed went hastily 
suppose silly ask paying people anything work things take harkaman said 
way space scourge lamia people laughed evidently 
harkaman shrugged 
well planet 
make kind mess want 
think ought pay spasso incredulous 
damn bunch savages savage xochitl locals haulteclere took 
seen prince viktor 
got men equipment xochitl valkanhayn said 
afford coddle locals 
afford harkaman told 
two ships 
use one raiding stay hold planet 
take away locals studiously antagonizing swamp whoever leave behind 
leave anybody behind use planetary base well join us spasso finally came 
three ships could real thing 
harkaman looked inquiringly 
gentlemen trask said putting wrongly 
mean let join us well want put like valkanhayn conceded 
admit nemesis would big end 
three ships could real base 
nikky gratham father two started jagannath look grathams got 
interested harkaman asked 
afraid 
course landed tanith may great possibilities 
suppose reserve decision look around little 
stars sky good measure sliver moon western horizon 
small moon close 
walked edge landing stage elaine walking 
noise inside nemesis crew feasting lamia space scourge grew fainter 
south star moved one pinnaces left planet watch 
firelight far could hear singing 
suddenly realized poor devils locals valkanhayn spasso enslaved 
elaine went away quickly 
fill space viking glamour lucas turned 
baron rathmore come along serve year hitch ride home base planet cash politically lucas trask 
moment 
told lot typical 
hope 
pack sadistic brutes piggish along 
well brutality bad manners condone spasso valkanhayn pair ignominious little crooks stupid along 
andray dunnan gotten ahead us might done one good thing wretched life 
understand come 
think still rathmore said 
knew knew nevil ormm 
ormm ambitious dunnan insanely vindictive broke sour laugh 
telling come directly maybe want base tanith 
would something constructive dunnan destroyer 
think took cargo equipment somewhere sold 
think wait till fairly sure ship finished 
come shoot place way bit abruptly 
way wedding think time 
next morning harkaman took aircar went look city forks river 
completely new sense built since collapse federation civilization loss civilized technologies 
huddled long irregularly triangular mound evidently raise flood level 
generations labor must gone 
eyes civilization using contragravity powered equipment impressive 
fifty hundred men adequate equipment could gotten thing summer 
forcing think terms spadeful spadeful earth cartload cartload creaking behind straining beasts timber timber cut axes dressed adzes stone stone brick brick could appreciate 
even walled palisade tree trunks behind earth rocks banked along river docks boats moored 
locals simply called tradetown 
approached big gong began booming white puff smoke followed thud signal gun 
boats long canoe like craft round bowed many oared barges put hastily river binoculars could see people scattering surrounding fields driving cattle ahead 
time city nobody sight 
seemed developed pretty fair air raid warning system nine hundred odd hours exposed figurative mercies boake valkanhayn garvan spasso 
saved entirely section city burned evidences shelling 
light chemical explosive stuff city good cow even two kill milking 
circled slowly thousand feet 
turned away black smoke began rising might pottery works brick kilns outskirts something resinous evidently fed fires 
columns black smoke began rising across countryside sides river 
know people civilized limit term contragravity nuclear energy harkaman said 
gunpowder one thing think rather impressive old terran civilizations much 
organized society anybody starting toward civilization 
hate think happen planet spasso valkanhayn stay long 
might good thing long run 
good things long run often tough happening 
know happen spasso valkanhayn though 
start decivilizing 
stay need something take locals go chicken stealing time stay lording slaves finally ships wear able fix 
time locals jump watching wipe 
meantime locals learn lot 
turned aircar west along river 
looked villages 
one two dated federation period plantations whatever happened 
built within past five centuries 
couple recently destroyed punishment crime self defense 
know said length going everybody favor 
going let spasso valkanhayn persuade take planet away 
harkaman piloting turned sharply 
crazy something somebody makes statement understand tell crazy 
ask means 
said target harkaman grinned 
mean lord trask catch dunnan pursuit get interception 
know source quotation 
looks like good place intercept 
learns base hit sooner later 
even pick information ships start coming would batting around old federation 
harkaman considered moment nodded 
yes could set base like nergal xochitl agreed 
four five ships space vikings traders gilgameshers either planets time 
cargo dunnan took space enterprise could start base like 
anything near need know spasso valkanhayn 
get gram 
stands investors tanith adventure duke angus lost everything put 
willing throw good money bad get back handsome profit boot 
ought planets rowboat ox cart level far away could raided lot things need 
right know half dozen within five hundred light years 
kind spasso valkanhayn habit raiding though 
besides machinery get gold valuable merchandise could sold gram 
could make go go farther hunting dunnan sitting tanith going looking 
way used hunt marsh pigs colada kid find good place sit wait 
illustration valkanhayn spasso aboard nemesis dinner take much guiding keep conversation subject tanith resources advantages possibilities 
finally reached brandy coffee trask said idly believe together could really make something planet 
telling along spasso broke eagerly 
wonderful planet could 
possibilities 
need spaceport one thing 
well valkanhayn wanted know 
spaceport harkaman told 
could one 
need shipyard capable kind heavy repair work 
capable building complete ship fact 
never saw ship come viking base planet kind cargo worth dickering taken damage getting 
prince viktor xochitl makes good half money ship repairs nikky gratham jagannath everrards hoth 
engine works hyperdrive normal space pseudograv trask added 
steel mill collapsed matter plant 
robotic equipment works oh reason valkanhayn cried 
would take twenty trips ship size one get stuff ever able pay sort base duke angus wardshaven planned 
enterprise practically duplicate nemesis carried everything would needed get started pirated 
going tell gentlemen truth harkaman chuckled 
intend 
laid cigar sipped brandy explained duke angus tanith adventure 
part larger plan angus wanted gain economic supremacy wardshaven forward political ambitions 
however entirely practical business proposition 
opposed thought would good proposition tanith work disadvantage home planet end 
told enterprise cargo industrial construction equipment carried told andray dunnan pirated 
annoyed money invested project 
annoy put mildly took ship dunnan shot wedding wounded father law killed lady married less half hour 
fitted ship expense took captain harkaman left without command enterprise pirated came hunt dunnan kill 
believe best establishing base tanith 
base operated profit operated 
picked cigar puffed slowly 
inviting gentlemen join partners 
well still told us going get money finance spasso insisted 
duke wardshaven others invested original tanith adventure put 
way recover lost enterprise 
duke wardshaven running us valkanhayn objected 
duke wardshaven harkaman reminded gram 
tanith 
three thousand light years 
seemed satisfactory answer 
spasso however wanted know would run things tanith 
hold meeting three crews began 
nothing kind trask told 
running things tanith 
people may allow orders debated voted inform respective crews effect 
orders give name obeyed without argument 
know men take valkanhayn said 
know take smart harkaman told 
know happen know running ships ships crews running 
well way 
lucas trask owner captain 
obey orders done everybody else obeys mine 
spasso looked valkanhayn shrugged 
man wants boake 
want give argument first order trask said people working paid 
beaten plug uglies guarding 
want leave may given presents furnished transportation home 
wish stay issued rations furnished clothing bedding need paid wages 
work kind pay token system set commissary buy things 
disks plastic titanium something stamped uncounterfeitable 
get alvyn karffard see 
organize work gangs promote best intelligent foremen 
guards could taken hand ground fighter sergeant given sword world weapons tactical training use train others need sepoy army sort 
even best good substitute armed force conspicuously displayed unhesitatingly used necessary 
raiding villages food anything else 
pay anything get locals 
trouble valkanhayn predicted 
men think anything local belongs anybody take 
harkaman said 
planet raiding 
planet locals 
raid planet people 
teach 
x took valkanhayn spasso time argument convince crews trask thought necessary 
harkaman seemed satisfied baron rathmore wardshaven politician 
like talking lot uncommitted small landholders taking somebody livery maintenance latter said 
use much pressure make think idea 
meetings crews heated arguments baron rathmore made frequent speeches lord trask tanith admiral harkaman titles rathmore suggestion remained loftily aloof 
ships everybody owned everything common meant nobody owned anything 
taken tanith basis diffused ownership nobody either crew quite stupid enough think could anything planet 
joining nemesis appeared getting something nothing 
end voted place authority lord trask admiral harkaman 
tanith would feudal lordship three ships together fleet 
admiral harkaman first act authority order general inspection fleet units 
shocked condition two ships expected much worse 
spaceworthy gotten hoth power 
combat worthy combat severe 
original estimate nemesis could knocked pieces anything conservative 
engines fair shape armament bad 
going spend time sitting tanith told two captains 
planet raiding base raiding operative word 
going raid easy planets 
planet raided impunity worth time takes getting 
going fight every planet hit going jeopardize lives men includes crews well mine powered armed ships 
spasso tried argue 
getting along 
harkaman cursed 
yes 
know getting along chicken stealing planets like set xipototec melkarth 
making enough cover maintenance expenses ship shape 
well days 
ships ought full overhaul skip till shipyard 
insist least guns launchers order 
detection equipment get fix nemesis till less twenty thousand miles planet 
better get lamia condition first trask said 
put planet watch instead pair pinnaces 
work lamia started next day considerable friction heat generated officers engineers sent nemesis 
baron rathmore went aboard came back laughing 
know ship run asked 
sort soviet officers chief engineer exec guns missiles astrogator 
spasso animated ventriloquist dummy 
talked 
none pin anything think going heave spasso command appoint one one thinks 
know long last string tape job like one ship 
hold till get something better 
get rid spasso harkaman agreed 
think put one people place 
valkanhayn stay command space scourge spaceman 
spasso good anything 
local problem complicated 
locals spoke lingua terra sort like every descendant race gone sol system third century barely comprehensible sort 
civilized planets language frozen unalterably microbooks voice tapes 
microbooks read sound tapes heard aid electricity tanith lost long ago 
people spasso valkanhayn kidnaped enslaved came villages within radius five hundred miles 
half wanted repatriated given gifts knives tools blankets bits metal seemed chief standard value medium exchange shipped home 
finding proper villages easy 
village news spread space vikings would hereafter pay received 
lamia overhauled rapidly possible 
still far good ship much closer one 
fitted best detection equipment could assembled put orbit alvyn karffard took command spasso officers valkanhayn nemesis 
harkaman intending use retraining lamia space scourge officers rotated back forth 
illustration labor guards score number relieved duties issued sword world firearms given intensive training 
trade tokens stamps colored plastic introduced store set could exchanged sword world items 
dawned locals tokens could also used trading among money seemed one adjuncts civilization lost along tanith downward path 
able use contragravity hand lifters hand towed lifter skids several even learning operate things like bulldozers least extent knowing lever button 
give little time trask thought watching gang work spaceport floor 
many years half piloting aircars 
soon lamia orbital watch space scourge set spaceport work started 
decided valkanhayn would take gram enough nemesis people would go along insure good faith part talk duke angus tanith investors 
baron rathmore paytrik morland several wardshaven gentlemen adventurers latter function alvyn karffard act valkanhayn exec private orders supersede command necessary guatt kirbey astrogating 
take nemesis space scourge first make big raid harkaman said 
send space scourge back gram empty 
baron rathmore lord valpry rest talk duke angus tanith investors lot travel films tanith 
able show tanith producing 
ought little money invest 
otto ships worried trask 
suppose dunnan comes finds nobody spasso lamia chance take 
personally think year year half dunnan shows 
know fooled trying guess 
sort raid mind need two ships case want leave ships gone even 
comes think either 
trust spasso alone leave enough people make sure 
leave alvyn mean lot work otherwise ship 
baron rathmore young valpry men training sepoys 
shuffle things around leave valkanhayn men place spasso might even talk spasso going along 
mean endure table would wise 
picked place raid three 
first khepera 
thirty light years 
amount much chicken stealing 
give green hands relatively safe combat training give us idea spasso valkanhayn people behave give confidence next job 
amaterasu 
information amaterasu twenty years old 
lot things happen twenty years 
know never fairly civilized like terra beginning atomic era 
nuclear energy lost course nothing beyond hydroelectric solarelectric power nonnuclear jet aircraft good chemical explosive weapons use freely 
last known raided ship excalibur twenty years ago 
sounds promising 
third planet beowulf 
take enough damage amaterasu make difference saved amaterasu last might needing many repairs 
like yes 
nuclear energy 
think would wise mention beowulf captains spasso valkanhayn 
wait till hit khepera amaterasu 
may feeling like heroes 
xi khepera left bad taste trask mouth 
still tasting colored turbulence died screen left gray nothingness hyperspace

spasso turned indignantly

right 
looked searchingly trask moment turned back spasso 
tired hearing pop mouth lousy two million stellars

maybe would lamia three ship fleet planetary base meet expenses

live long 
moment spasso still affronted 
temporarily vulpine face showed avaricious hope apprehension 
evidently knew otto harkaman reputation things harkaman done idea easy way make money 
khepera easy locals anything fight 
small arms light cannon able fire rounds 
wherever attempted resistance combat cars swooped dropping bombs firing machine guns auto cannon 
yet fought bitterly hopelessly would defending traskon 
trask busied getting coffee cigarette one robots 
looked spasso gone away harkaman sitting edge desk loading short pipe 
well saw elephant lucas harkaman said 
seem liked 
elephant old terran expression read somewhere 
know elephant animal size one gram megatheres 
expression means experiencing something first time makes great impression 
elephants must something see 
first viking raid

thrilling 
everything gone perfectly even valkanhayn gang goofed

next morning everything value collected sent aboard started cross country five hundred miles another city first hundred countryside asmoke burning villages valkanhayn men pillaged night

trask affected hospitable offer 
stolgoland lay across narrow shallow sea state eglonsby dotted islands every one turn dotted oil wells

eglonsby espionage stolgoland similarly active 
stolgonian armies massed four seaports coast facing eglonsby frantic gathering every sort ship available

gadolinium essential hyperdrive engines engines ship size nemesis required fifty pounds 
sword worlds worth several times weight gold

mine one thing good run spaceship diesel oil 
suppose mines could reopened new refineries built could trade plutonium gadolinium 
none 
could charge prices need tell gadolinium sells sword worlds 
could could business anybody eglonsby stolgoland 
would get plutonium think beowulfers hyperships everything else harkaman snapped fingers

hey thinking selling amaterasu plutonium beowulf gadolinium could make big profit ends deal 
know would happen next ships planets place years 
want like want hole head

tanith amaterasu beowulf could work good triangular trade three would profit 
cost men ship damage ammunition either

also hereditary monarchy made kind sense 
trask efforts explain political social structure sword worlds met incomprehension bentrik 
sounds like feudalism right 
king owes position support great nobles owe barons landholding knights owe people 
limits beyond none go vassals turn 
well suppose people barony rebel king send troops support baron troops outside personal guard enough men police royal city hold crown lands king troops 
wants troops get great nobles get vassal barons raise calling people 
another source dissatisfaction king angus gram augmenting forces hiring planet mercenaries
