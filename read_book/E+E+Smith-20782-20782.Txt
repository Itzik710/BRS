triplanetary edward e smith ph sure readers highly pleased us give first installment story dr smith 
continue several numbers worthy follower skylark stories much appreciated readers 
think find story superior earlier ones 
dr smith certainly narrative power joined scientific position makes ideal author columns 
illustrated morey chapter pirates space apparently motionless passengers crew interplanetary liner hyperion bored serenely onward space normal acceleration 
railed sanctum one corner control room bell tinkled smothered whirr heard captain bradley frowned studied brief message upon tape recorder message flashed desk operator panel 
beckoned second officer whose watch read aloud reports scout patrols still negative 
still negative 
officer scowled thought 
already searched beyond widest possible location wreckage 
two unexplained disappearances inside month first dione rhea plate lifeboat recovered 
looks bad sir 
one might accident two might possibly coincidence voice died away 
might coincidence mean three would get habit captain finished thought 
whatever happened happened quick 
neither time say word location recorders simply went dead 
course detector screens armament 
according observatories clear ether trust tellus luna 
given new orders course yes sir 
detectors full three courses defensive screen trips projectors manned suits hooks 
every object detected outer space investigated immediately vessels warned stay beyond extreme range 
anything entering fourth zone rayed 
right going known type vessel could made away without detection second officer argued 
wonder something wild rumors hearing lately illustration systematically precisely great cone battle coming formation developed jovian wars forces three planets fighting space 
bah course snorted captain 
pirates ships faster light fifth order rays nullification gravity mass without inertia ridiculous proved impossible 
sir pirates operating space looks much like get far good big battery full kilowatt hours behind three courses heavy screen good solid set multiplex rays 
properly used good enough anybody 
pirates neptunians angels devils ships sunbeams tackle hyperion burn ether leaving captain desk watch officer resumed tour duty 
six great lookout plates alert observers peered blank far flung ultra sensitive detector screens encountering obstacle ether empty thousands upon thousands kilometers 
signal lamps upon pilot panel dark warning bells silent 
brilliant point white center pilot closely ruled micrometer grating exactly upon cross hairs directors showed immense vessel precisely upon calculated course laid automatic integrating course plotters 
everything quiet order 
well sir reported briefly captain bradley well 
danger serious far external even unsuspected gnawing great ship vitals 
locked shielded compartment deep interior liner great air purifier 
man leaned primary duct aorta flowed stream pure air supplying entire vessel 
man grotesque full panoply space armor leaned duct leaned drill bit deeper deeper steel wall pipe

tube terminated heavy rubber balloon surrounded frail glass bulb 
man stood tense one hand holding silica steel helmeted head large pocket chronometer lightly grasping balloon 
sneering grin upon face awaited exact second action carefully pre determined instant right hand closing would shatter fragile flask force contents primary air stream hyperion far main saloon regular evening dance full swing

oh see earth exclaimed 
way turn mr costigan like conway costigan burly young first officer liner turned dials 
plate looking back tellus one looking ahead 
earth brilliantly shining crescent far beneath flying vessel 
ruddy mars silvery jupiter blazed splendor ineffable background utterly indescribable blackness background thickly besprinkled dimensionless points dazzling brilliance stars 
oh wonderful breathed girl awed 
course suppose old stuff ground gripper know could look forever think 
want come every dance 
know voice broke suddenly queer rasping catch seized arm frantic clutch quickly went limp 
stared sharply understood instantly message written eyes eyes enlarged staring hard brilliant full soul searing terror slumped helpless support 
act exhaling lungs almost entirely empty yet held breath seized microscope belt snapped lever emergency 
control room gasped every speaker throughout great cruiser void blared warning forced already evacuated lungs absolute emptiness 
vee two gas get tight writhing twisting fierce struggle keep lungs gulping draft noxious atmosphere unconscious form girl draped limply left arm costigan leaped toward portal nearest lifeboat 
orchestra instruments crashed floor dancing couples fell sprawled inertly tortured first officer swung door lifeboat open dashed across tiny room air valves 
throwing wide open put mouth orifice let laboring lungs gasp eager fill cold blast roaring tanks 
air hunger partially assuaged held breath broke open emergency locker donned one space suits always kept opened valves wide order flush uniform lingering trace lethal gas 
leaped back companion 
shutting air released stream pure oxygen held face made shift force lungs compressing releasing chest body 
soon drew spasmodic breath choking coughing changed gaseous stream one pure air speaking urgently showed signs returning consciousness 
clio marsden life

hang onto brace keep face air stream get suit around got nodded weakly assured could hold valve work minute encase one protective coverings 
sat upon bench recovering strength flipped lifeboat visiphone projector shot invisible beam control room saw space armored figures furiously busy panels 
dirty work cross roads blazed captain man man formality disregarded often triplanetary service 
skulduggery afoot somewhere primary air maybe way got two ships pirates might timed bomb see anybody could stowed away inspections nobody franklin neutralize shield air room going look around anyway 
join fellows 
shaken girl asked 
think remember saying vee two gas 
forbidden anyway owe life conway never forget never 
thanks others rest us vee two forbidden costigan replied grimly eyes fast upon flashing plate whose point projection deep bowels vessel 
penalty using death sight 
gangsters pirates use since nothing lose death list already 
life saved yet may wish let ride get done 
others far gone oxygen brought even around seconds later quick got 
sure antidote carry lock box armor know use crooks use vee two always expecting 
since air pure half hour able revive others easily enough get whatever going happen next 
bird right air room chief engineer suit franklin 
passenger disguised slugged chief took suit projectors hole duct p washed maybe scheduled us performance nothing else life go protested girl 
armor much better emergency suit wearing got mr franklin lewiston besides idiot snapped 
live pirate aboard going altogether busy outsiders directly 
worry going give break 
taking standish rub like blot 
stay right come back commanded heavy vacuum insulated door lifeboat clanged shut behind leaped promenade 
straight across saloon made way paying attention inert forms scattered 
going blank wall manipulated almost invisible dial set flush surface swung heavy door aside lifted standish fearsome weapon 
squat huge heavy resembled somewhat overgrown machine rifle one possessing thick short telescope several opaque condensing lenses parabolic reflectors 
laboring weight thing strode along corridors clambered heavily short stairways 
finally came purifier room grinned savagely saw greenish haze light obscuring door walls shield still place pirate still inside still flooding terrible vee two hyperion primary air 
set peculiar weapon unfolded three massive legs crouched behind threw switch 
dull red beams frightful intensity shot reflectors sparks almost lightning proportions leaped shielding screen impact 
roaring snapping conflict went seconds superior force standish greenish radiance gave way 
behind metal door ran gamut color red yellow blinding whiter literally exploded molten vaporized burned away 
aperture thus made costigan could plainly see pirate space armor chief engineer armor proof rifle fire could reflect neutralize little time even terrific beam costigan employing 
pirate unarmed vicious flare incandescence leaped lewiston spend force spitting crackling pyrotechnics ether wall squat monstrous standish 
costigan infernal machine rely upon vibratory destruction 
almost first flash pirate weapon officer touched trigger double report ear shattering narrowly confined space pirate body literally flew mist half kilogram shell tore armor exploded 
costigan shut beam slightest softening one hard lineament stared around air room making sure serious damage done vital machinery air purifier lungs great space ship 
dismounting standish lugged back main saloon replaced safe set combination lock 
thence lifeboat clio cried relief saw unhurt 
oh conway afraid something would happen exclaimed led rapidly upward toward control room 
course paused 
sure replied laconically 
nothing 
feel back normal right think except scared death control 
suppose good anything whatever count 
fine may needed 
everybody apparently except like warning could hold breath got suits 
know see smell anything 
inhaled second saw eyes 
see man get jolt stuff never forget 
engineers got first course must wiped 
got saloon 
passing warned luckily enough breath left give word 
quite fellows time get away see em control room 
suppose revived payment kindly warning gas attack girl laughed shaky game 
something like probably answered lightly 
soon find going happen next 
control room saw least dozen armored figures rushing seated instruments tense ready 
fortunate costigan veteran space though young years saloon fortunate familiar horrible outlawed gas fortunate presence mind enough sheer physical stamina enough send warning without allowing one paralyzing trace enter lungs 
captain bradley men watch several officers quarters wardrooms space hardened veterans obeyed instantly without question amplifiers gasped command get tight 
exhaling inhaling air passages snapped dread vee two heard literally jumped armored suits space flushing volume volume unquestionable air holding breath last possible second straining lungs could endure 
costigan waved girl vacant bench cautiously changed armor emergency suit wearing approached captain 
anything sight sir asked saluting 
started something 
started locate 
tried send general sector alarm hardly started blanketed wave 
look following captain eyes costigan stared high powered set ship operator 
upon plate instead moving living three dimensional picture flashing glare blinding white light speaker instead intelligible speech issuing roaring crackling stream noise 
impossible bradley burst violently 
gram metal inside fourth zone within hundred thousand kilometers yet must close send wave 
second thinks think costigan bluff commander reactionary old school breed furious baffled raging inwardly come grips invisible undetectable foe 
face face inexplicable however listened younger men unusual tolerance 
possible quite evident got something costigan voice bitter 
service ships never get anything experimented years pirates always get new stuff soon discovered 
good thing see got part message away scouts trace interference 
pirates know long concluded grimly 
spoke truly 
another word spoken outer screen flared white beam terrific power simultaneously appeared upon one lookout plates vivid picture pirate vessel huge black globe steel emitting flaring offensive beams force 
invisibility lost gone action lay revealed middle first zone point blank range 
instantly powerful weapons hyperion brought bear blast full driven beams stranger screens flamed incandescent 
heavy guns recoil whose fierce salvos frame giant globe trembled shuddered shot tons high explosive shell 
pirate commander known accurately strength liner knew armament impotent forces command 
screens invulnerable giant shells exploded harmlessly mid space miles objective 
suddenly frightened pencil flame stabbed brilliantly black hulk enemy 
empty ether tore mighty defensive screens tough metal outer inner walls 
every ether defense hyperion vanished acceleration dropped quarter normal value 
right battery room bradley groaned 
emergency drive 
rays done seem put shell anywhere near guns ineffective guns silenced forever frightful beam destruction stabbed relentlessly control room whiffing existence pilot gunnery lookout panels men 
air rushed space suits three survivors bulged drumhead tightness pressure room decreased 
costigan pushed captain lightly toward wall seized girl leaped direction 
let get quick cried miniature radio instruments helmets automatically taking duty transmitting speech sound disks refused function 
see us ether wall still spy sprays get outside know 
working blue prints probably take desk next even bounded toward door become outer seal airlock annihilating ray tore space quitted flight 
airlock several levels passengers quarters hurried lifeboat whose one doorway commanded full length third lounge ideal spot either defense escape outward means miniature cruiser 
entered retreat felt weight begin increase 
force applied helpless liner moving normal acceleration 
make costigan asked captain 
tractor beams apparently 
got something right 
taking us somewhere fast 
go get couple standishes another suit armor better dig soon small room became veritable fortress housing two formidable engines destruction 
first officer made another longer trip returning complete suit triplanetary space armor exactly like worn two men considerably smaller 
added factor safety better put clio emergency suits good much battle 
suppose ever fired standish soon learn replied pluckily 
two work know take hold case one us goes 
changing suits better put stuff got service special phones detectors 
stick little disk onto chest bit tape low sight 
wishbone best place 
take wrist watch wear one continuously never take second 
put pearls wear time 
take capsule hide skin place found except rigid search 
swallow emergency goes easily works well inside outside 
important thing get along alone lose everything else without capsule whole system shot pieces 
outfit get separated talk us wearing em although somewhat different forms 
need talk loud mutter enough 
handy little outfits almost impossible find capable lot things 
thanks conway remember clio replied turned toward tiny locker follow instructions 
scouts patrols catching us pretty quick operator sent warning 
afraid ether empty far concerned 
could neutralize detector screens scouts detectors 
captain bradley stood silent astonishment conversation 
eyes bulged slightly costigan wearing em held peace girl disappeared look dawning comprehension came face 
oh see sir said respectfully far respectfully ever addressed mere first officer 
meaning wearing shortly assume 
service specials specify exactly service mention believe costigan grinned 
explains several things particularly recognition vee two uncanny control speed reaction 
costigan interrupted positively 
situation apt get altogether serious overlook bets 
get away take away never know routine equipment triplanetary service 
know keep mouth shut 
hanging junk lot stuff kit flashed standish except brought us three 
whether think real jam chance getting away mightly close zero 
gone far might well tell believe birds pirates ordinary sense word 
may possible think covered broke girl came back appearances small triplanetary officer three settled long eventless wait 
hour hour flew ether finally lurching swing abrupt increase acceleration 
short consultation captain bradley turned visiray set beam minimum power peered cautiously downward direction opposite knew pirate vessel must 
three stared plate seeing infinity emptiness marked infinitely remote coldly brilliant stars 
stared space vast area heavens blotted saw faintly illuminated peculiar blue luminescence vast ball sphere large close seemed dropping downward toward though world came stop paused weightless vast door slid smoothly aside drawn upward airlock floated quietly air small brightly lighted orderly city metallic buildings gently hyperion lowered come rest embracing arms regulation landing cradle 
well wherever remarked captain bradley grimly 
fireworks start assented costigan questioning glance girl 
mind answered unspoken question 
believe surrendering either 
right men squatted behind ether walls terrific weapons girl prone behind 
long wait 
group human beings men appearance americans appeared unarmed little lounge 
soon well inside room bradley costigan released upon without compunction full power frightful projectors 
reflectors doorway tore concentrated double beam pure destruction beam reach goal 
yards men met screen impenetrable density 
instantly gunners pressed triggers stream high explosive shells issued roaring weapons 
shells also futile 
struck shield vanished vanished without exploding without leaving trace show ever existed 
costigan sprang feet could launch intended attack vast tunnel appeared beside annihilating ray swept entire width liner cutting instantly smooth cylinder emptiness 
air rushed fill vacuum three visitors felt seized invisible forces drawn tunnel 
floated buildings finally slanting downward toward door great high powered structure 
doors opened closed behind last stood upright room evidently office busy executive

seated impassively desk gray man 
dressed entirely gray heavy hair gray eyes gray even tanned skin seemed give impression grayness disguise 
overwhelming personality radiated aura grayness gentle gray dove resistless driving gray super dreadnaught hard inflexible brittle gray fracture high carbon steel 
captain bradley first officer costigan miss marsden man spoke quietly crisply 
intended two men live long 
detail however pass moment 
may remove suits 
neither officer moved stared back speaker unflinchingly 
accustomed repeating instructions man desk continued voice still low level instinct deadly menace 
may choose removing suits dying 
costigan moved clio slowly took armor 
flashing exchange glances muttered word two officers threw suits simultaneously fired instant bradley lewiston costigan heavy automatic pistol whose bullets explosive shells tremendous power 
man gray surrounded impenetrable wall force smiled fusillade tolerantly maddeningly 
costigan leaped fiercely hurled backward struck unyielding invisible wall 
vicious beam snapped back place weapons snatched away three captives held former positions 
permitted demonstration futility gray man said hard voice becoming harder permit foolishness 
introduce 
known roger 
probably heard nothing yet live 
whether two live depends solely upon 
something student men fear die shortly 
able resourceful shown could valuable probably case shall course cease exist 
however proper time shall slight service process eliminated 
case miss marsden find undecided two courses action highly desirable unfortunately mutually exclusive 
father glad ransom exceedingly high figure spite fact may decide keep well let us say certain purposes 
yes clio rose magnificently occasion 
fear forgotten courageous spirit flashed clear young eyes emanated slender rounded young body erect defiance 
since captive course anything please certain point believe sign heard outburst roger pressed button tall comely woman appeared woman indefinite age uncertain nationality 
show miss marsden apartment directed two women went man came 
cargo unloaded sir newcomer reported 
two men five women indicated taken hospital report man 
well dispose others usual fashion 
minion went roger continued emotionlessly collectively passengers may worth million would worth waste time upon 
anyway blazed costigan helpless enraged beyond caution 
heard mad scientists tried destroy earth equally mad geniuses thought napoleons capable conquering even solar system 
whichever know get away 
neither 
however scientist direct many scientists 
mad 
undoubtedly noticed several peculiar features place yes particularly artificial gravity always considered impossible screens 
ordinary ether wall opaque one direction bar matter transparent ways something impenetrable matter 
could understand explained merely two smaller developments 
serious designs upon earth upon solar system desire rule control destinies masses futile brainless men 
however certain ends view 
accomplish plans require hundreds millions gold hundreds millions platinum noble metal five kilograms bromide radium shall take planets solar system leave 
shall take spite puerile efforts fleets triplanetary league 
structure floating planetary orbit designed built direction 
protected meteorites certain forces devising 
undetectable invisible detectors touch light waves bent around without loss distortion 
discussing points length may realize exactly position 
intimated assistance 
could offer man make join outfit demanded costigan venomously 
many things 
roger cold tone betrayed emotion recognition costigan open bitter contempt 
many men bound many ties 
needs wants longings desires differ man man satisfy practically 
personally take delight society young beautiful women many men taste urges found quite efficient 
greed thirst fame longing power including many qualities usually regarded noble 
promise deliver 
demand loyalty certain things relatively short period 
else men please 
conclusion use two conveniently need 
therefore may choose service alternative 
exactly alternative go 
suffice say minor research progressing satisfactorily 
result extinction perhaps mention extinction particularly pleasant 
say bradley roared 
intended give unexpurgated classification rudely interrupted 
hold minute snapped costigan 
miss marsden nothing discussion returned roger icily 
bargain fact believe shall keep time 
mind destroy allow ransomed find door closed permit open 
case string along chief take started say run clear across board barked costigan 
well 
decision expected men type 
gray man touched two buttons two creatures entered room 
put men separate cells second level ordered 
search skin weapons may armor 
seal doors mount special guards tuned 
imprisoned carefully searched bore arms nothing said thought communicators 
even instruments could concealed roger would detect use instantly 
least would run thought subject entered mind 
even roger inkling possibility costigan service special phones detectors spy ray instruments minute size infinitesimal power yet instruments working level ether effective great distances caused vibrations ether use could detected 
could innocent regulation personal equipment every officer space heavy goggles wrist watch supplementary pocket chronometer flash lamp automatic lighter sender money belt items equipment examined due care cleverest minds triplanetary secret service designated communicators pass ordinary search however careful costigan bradley finally locked designated cells still possessed ultra instruments 
chapter ii roger planetoid hall clio glanced around wildly bosom heaving eyes darting seeking even narrowest avenue escape 
could act however body clamped inflexibly though vise struggled motionless 
useless attempt escape anything except roger wishes guide informed somberly snapping instrument hand thus restoring thoroughly cowed girl freedom motion 
lightest wish law continued walked long corridor 
sooner realize must exactly pleases things easier life 
want keep living clio declared flash spirit 
always die know 
find passionless creature returned monotonously 
yield long pray death die unless roger wills 
like 
also struggled became whatever 
apartment 
stay roger gives orders concerning 
living automaton opened door stood silent impassive clio staring unutterable horror shrank past sumptuously furnished suite 
door closed soundlessly utter silence descended pall 
ordinary silence indescribable perfection absolute complete absence sound 
silence clio stood motionless 
tense rigid hopeless despairing stood magnificent room fighting almost overwhelming impulse scream 
suddenly heard cold voice roger speaking empty air 
wrought miss marsden 
use condition 
command rest insure rest may pull cord establish room ether wall wall cutting even voice voice ceased pulled cord savagely threw upon divan torrent gasping strangling rebellious sobs 
came voice ears 
deep within pervading every bone muscle made felt rather heard 
clio asked 
talk yet conway gasped relief every fiber thrilled new hope deep well remembered voice conway costigan 
keep still snapped 
act happy may spy ray 
hear may able hear 
talking must noticed sort rough sandpapery feeling necklace gave since got ether wall around beads dead 
feel anything like wrist watch breathe deeply twice 
feel anything safe talk loud please 
feel thing conway rejoiced 
tears forgotten old buoyant self 
wall real half believed 
trust much cut outside time wants 
remember told necklace warn spy ray ether watch detect anything level ether 
dead course since three phones direct connected touch bradley 
scared got lot better chance thought 
mean absolutely 
beginning think maybe got something know exists ultra wave 
course surprised searchers failed find instruments never occurred might clear field use quite believe yet able find indication even detect bands using 
going look around spy ray looking feel yes watch feels way 
fine sign interference either 
find trace ultra wave anything ether level know anywhere whole place 
got much stuff never heard supposed course ultra wave gives us edge 
well bradley got lot work wait minute thought 
back second 
brief pause soundless clear voice went good hunting woman gave blue willies alive full prettiest machinery communicators ever saw oh conway girl voice broke engulfing wave thanksgiving relief 
unutterably horrible thinking must happened others like running colossal bluff think 
good right lacks quite lot omnipotent 
get cocky either 
plenty happened plenty women men plenty may happen us unless put jets 
keep stiff upper lip want us yell 
bye silent voice ceased watch upon clio wrist became unobtrusive timepiece costigan solitary cell far tower room turned peculiarly goggled eyes toward scenes 
pockets hands manipulated tiny controls lenses goggles costigan keen highly trained eyes studied every concealed detail mechanism great globe planned must done 
finally took goggles spoke low voice bradley confined another windowless room across hall 
think got dope enough captain 
found put armor guns located main leads controls generators 
ether walls around us every door shielded guards outside doors one us 
robots men 
makes harder since undoubtedly connected direct roger desk give alarm first hint abnormal performance 
thing leaves desk 
see black panel little cord switch right door conduit cover 
give word tear see one red wire cable 
feeds shield generator door 
break wire join hall 
sorry one ultra wave spies together bad 
thought could went detail course action surveys shown possible 
left desk costigan exclaimed conversation continued almost hour 
soon find going start something going see clio swine changes things bradley hard voice curse 
somewhat blazed captain 
know two getting cruise 
something costigan declared grimly 
makes pass get blow whole sphere space us conway 
clio low voice trembling determined felt men gasped audibly forgotten three instruments circuit 
chance get away anything fighting mind 
maybe wants talk ransom anyway 
talk ransom going talk something else entirely costigan gritted voice changed suddenly 
say maybe well way 
find specials searched us know going plenty damage right soon 
roger probably fast worker cat mouse type say get started something mind besides 
think stall keep interested fifteen minutes sure anything help us get away horrible voice ceased roger broke ether wall apartment walked toward divan upon crouched wide eyed helpless trembling terror 
get ready bradley costigan directed tersely 
left clio ether wall abnormal signals would relayed desk knows chance anyone disturbing room 
holding beam switch good conductor metal wall full strength 
matter get warning 
hold beam exactly switch though dirty work 
tear red wire kill two guards 
know kill robot yes break eye lenses eardrums stop whatever send distress calls got em 
open door shield switch right 
costigan door flew open triplanetary captain leaped room 
armor cried 
yet snapped costigan 
standing rigid goggled eyes staring immovably spot upon ceiling 
move millimeter closed clio ether wall switch 
take ray second sunk 
five floors straight ahead corridor fourth door right 
switch feel ray watch 
snap right captain leaped away pace equaled men half years 
soon back costigan tested ether wall bridal suite make sure warning signal desk servants could reach roger within two officers hurried away toward room discarded space armor stored 
bad wear uniforms panted bradley short breath many flights stairs 
might helped disguise 
doubt many robots around probably got signals understand anyway 
meet anybody mean battle 
hold peering walls spy ray costigan seen two men approaching blocking intersecting corridor must turn 
two em man robot robot side 
wait right corner round take em costigan put away goggles readiness strife 
unsuspecting two pirates came view appeared two officers struck 
costigan inside drove short hard right low human pirate abdomen 
fiercely driven fist sank wrist soft tissues stricken man collapsed 
even blow landed costigan seen third enemy following close behind two watching pirate even training ray projector upon 
reacting automatically costigan swung unconscious opponent around front insensible body vicious ray tore 
crouching smallest possible compass straightened powerful body lashing force mighty steel spring hurling corpse straight flaming mouth projector 
weapon crashed floor dead pirate living went heap 
upon heap costigan hurled feeling enemy throat 
pirate wriggled clear countered gouging thrust would torn eyes slower man following instantly savage kick groin 
automaton geared set perform certain fixed duties mechanical precision lithe strong man hard training fighting every foul trick known murderous ilk 
costigan tyro art dirty fighting 
indeed maiming tricks foul combat unknown even rank file highly efficient secret service triplanetary league costigan sector chief unknown organization knew 
pleasure sportsmanship million dollar purses secret agents use nature weapons 
come grips possibly avoided forced fight fashion go one grim purpose kill kill shortest possible space time 
thus costigan opening soon came 
pirate launched particularly vicious kick dreaded coup de sabot costigan avoided lightning shift 
slight shift barely enough make kicker miss two powerful hands closed upon flying foot midair like sprung jaws bear trap 
closed twisted viciously fleeting instant 
shriek smothered heavy boot crashed carefully pre determined mark pirate definitely permanently 
struggle lasted scarcely ten seconds coming close bradley finished blinding deafening robot 
costigan picked projector donned spy ray goggles two hurried 
nice work chief must gift rough house way bradley exclaimed 
took live one practice helps brawls lot younger maybe faster costigan explained briefly penetrant gaze rigidly fore ran along one corridor another 
several guards living mechanical encountered way permitted offer opposition 
costigan saw first 
furious beam projector dead pirate riven nothingness two officers sped room costigan located afar 
three suits triplanetary space armor sealed cabinet whose doors costigan literally blew blast force rather consume time tracing power leads 
feel like something costigan encased armor heaved great sigh relief 
rough tumble right one two generator room full grief much stuff 
got take clio suit along carry door power room drop pick wrecked works 
contemptuous possible guards armored pair strode toward room housed pulsating heart immense fortress space 
guards encountered captains officers signaled frantically chief since alone could unleash frightful forces command profanely wondered unwonted silence enemy beams impotent mighty ether walls armor pirates without armor security planet vanished utterly ravening beams twin lewistons

wept pleaded stormed raged feigned submission played time torment touched slightest degree merciless gloating brain called roger 
tantalizing ruthless cat play done horrible gray brown face close wailed final despairing message costigan attacked hideous face fury tigress 
costigan bit bitter imprecation

costigan leaped outer door 
task go clio aid bradley would follow slowly bringing girl armor taking care possible pursuit 
sailed air spoke 
coming clio right girl questioningly half fearfully 
right conway 
voice almost unrecognizable broken retching agony 
everything went crazy found ether wall forgot

good girl keep busy one minute getting warnings wants get back board 
matter hurt oh 
sick horribly sick 
falling dizzy scarcely see head breaking little pieces know going die conway oh oh oh sheer relief time costigan think sympathizing clio real present distress mind body 
forgot ground gripper little touch space sickness 
wear directly right coming let go get far away street 
perhaps two hundred feet distant hundred feet tower room clio roger 
sprang directly toward large window floated upward corrected course accelerated pace firing backward various angles heavy service pistol uncaring point impact shells small blast destruction erupted

door wall vanished lewiston terrific beam pirate stood unharmed 
neither ravening ray explosive shell could harm snapped protective shield whose generator always upon person 
roger exactly ground gripper know handle without weight whereas costigan given six walls push even efficient weightless combat handicapped force gravitation 
keeping projector upon pirate seized first club hand long slender pedestal metal launched past pirate chief 
momentum mass velocity power mighty right arm swung bar pirate head 
fiercely driven mass metal taken roger head shoulders 
shield force utterly rigid impenetrable effect frightful blow set spinning end end like flying baton acrobatic drum major 
spinning form crashed opposite wall room bradley floated carrying clio armor 
without word captain loosened helpless girl grip upon bracket encased suit 
supporting window held lewiston upon captive head costigan propelled toward opening 
men knew roger shield force must threatened every instant allowed release probably would bring bear hand weapon even superior 
braced wall costigan sighted along roger body toward distant point lofty dome artificial planet gave gentle push 
grasping clio arm two officers shoved mightily feet three armored forms darted away toward hope escape emergency boat could launched shell great globe 
attempt reach hyperion escape one lifeboats would useless could forced great gates main air locks exits existed 
sailed onward air costigan keeping slowly floating form roger enveloped beam clio began recover 
suppose get gravity fixed asked apprehensively 
raying us shooting us may fixed already 
undoubtedly spare parts duplicate generators turn fall kill roger like 
get airship know get fast come 
hurt us hand weapons bring heavy stuff afraid use close shell 
wish could brought roger along continued savagely bradley 
right course altogether much like rabbit capturing wildcat 
lewiston done right much left us would sin shame 
great wall two men heaved mightily upon lever gate emergency port swung slowly open entered miniature cruiser void 
costigan familiar mechanism craft careful study prison cell manipulated controls 
gate massive gate went finally open space shooting toward distant tellus maximum acceleration small craft capable 
costigan cut two phones circuit spoke attention fixed upon extremely distant point 
samms called sharply 
costigan 
right yes sure absolutely tell em sammy got company 
sound disks helmets girl captain heard costigan share conversation 
bradley stared erstwhile first officer amazement even clio often heard mighty half mythical name 
surely bewildering young man must rank high speak familiarly virgil samms powerful head space pervading secret service triplanetary league turned general call bradley stated rather asked 
long ago touch right along costigan answered 
know look know ether wave detectors useless find 
every vessel seven sectors clear scout patrols concentrating point call battleships cruisers afloat 
enough operatives ultra waves locate globe spot point vessels 
prisoners asked girl 
killed hard telling costigan shrugged 
depends things turn 
lack lot safe yet personal opinion going real war 
worrying mostly chance bradley assented 
chase us course 
sure speed 
depends far away nearest triplanetary vessels 
anyway done everything laps gods 
silence fell costigan cut clio phone came seat upon reclining white stricken worn horrible terrifying ordeals last hours 
seated beside blushed vividly deep blue eyes met gray ones steadily 
clio flushed hotly stopped 
secret agent whose clear keen brain physical danger could cloud proved never loss emergency however desperate quick witted officer floundered embarrassment like schoolboy continued doggedly afraid gave away back gave away mean filled pause 
share hold want know love conway love man groaned face lined hard whole body rigid 
half tell clio 
need hold held life 
never woman meant anything never another 
woman ever existed 

see impossible course impossible 
released finger shields four hands met tightly clasped low voice thrilled feeling went love love 
matters 
wish costigan returned bitterly know letting 
eating 
clio marsden curtis marsden daughter 
nineteen years old 
think places done things 
seen done anything know 
love girl like homeless space flea planet three weeks three years 
hard boiled egg 
trouble shooter brawler instinct training 
sp bit word went quickly know lot never know let know better lay girl 
best believe 
conway neither girl answered softly glorious light eyes 
late 
ship another things since come really know sunk 
situation control know neither us would change could know 
know much admit know thought keep admire 
honor service conway dearest men made keeping three planets fit places live know virgil samms chief lieutenant would man four thousand million makes think demanded sharply 
told indirectly 
else known universe could possibly call sammy hard course must never like soft men anyway 
brawl good cause 
much man conway real real man love catch us right die together least finished passionately 
right sweetheart course admitted 
believe could really let let go even though know ought hands locked together even firmly 
ever get jam going kiss time taking helmet 
fact taking many chances keeping finger shields 
snap em clio mine pirates ought getting fairly close time 
hands released armor tight costigan went join bradley control board 
coming captain asked 
good 
quite ways yet 
least hour say cruiser get within range 
see locate pirates chasing 
accident little spy ray good much except close work 
afraid first warning take hold us beam spear us ray 
probably beam though one emergency lifeboats want destroy unless 
also imagine roger wants us alive pretty badly

sleep night 
quite sleep informed levelly 
never thought nervous bradley side 
right though stay 
watch like couple old hens one chick 
come lie go bye bye 
clio laughed simile lay obediently 
costigan sat upon edge great divan holding hand chatted idly 
silences grew longer clio remarks became fewer soon long lashed lids fell deep regular breathing showed sound asleep 
man stared heart eyes 
young beautiful lovely love formally religious every thought sincere prayer 
could get mess fit live planet give one chance one costigan laboring days terrific strain going short sleep 
half hypnotized mixed emotions staring smooth curves clio cheek eyes closed still holding hand sank soft cushions beside oblivion 
thus sleeping hand hand like two children bradley found tender fatherly expression came face looked 
nice little girl clio mused made costigan broke mould 
fine couple kids old tellus ever produced 
could sleep 
yawned prodigiously lay clio left almost instantly asleep 
hours later men awakened merry peal laughter 
clio sitting regarding sparkling eyes 
refreshed buoyant ravenously hungry highly amused 
costigan amazed annoyed considered failure self appointed task bradley calm matter fact 
thanks nice bodyguard two clio laughed sobered quickly 
slept wonderfully well wonder sleep night without making hold hand night oh mind bradley commented 
mind costigan exclaimed eyes tone spoke volumes tongue left unsaid 
prepared ate another meal one clio full justice rested refreshed begun discuss possibilities escape nerado three armed guards entered room 
nevian scientist placed box upon table began make adjustments upon panels eyeing terrestrials attentively setting 
time staccato burst articulate speech issued box costigan saw great light 
got hold exclaimed waving arms excitedly 
see clio voices pitched either higher lower probably higher built audio frequency changer 
nobody fool fish nerado heard costigan voice doubt 
long neck looped angled nevian gratification although neither side could understand knew intelligent speech hearing attributes common two races 
fact altered markedly relations captors captives 
nevians admitted among strange bipeds might quite intelligent terrestrials became hopeful 
bad talk costigan summed situation 
might well take easy make best particularly since able figure possible way getting away 
talk hear learn language time 
maybe make kind deal take us back system make break 
nevians eager terrestrials establish communication nerado kept newly devised frequency changer constant use 
need describing length details interchange languages 
suffice say starting bottom learned babies learn great advantage babies possessing fully developed capable brains 
human beings learning tongue nevia several amphibians incidentally clio marsden learning triplanetarian two officers knowing well would much easier nevians learn logically built common language three planets master senseless intricacies english 
weeks two parties able understand fashion using weird mixture languages 
soon ideas exchanged nevian scientists built transformers small enough worn collar like terrestrials captives allowed roam throughout great vessel compartment stored dismembered pirate lifeboats sealed 
thus left long doubt another fish shaped cruiser world revealed upon lookout plates awful emptiness interstellar space 
sister ship going solarian system cargo iron plentiful nerado explained involuntary guests 
hope gang got bugs worked super ship costigan muttered savagely companions nerado turned away 
outfit get something load iron get weeks passed weeks blue white star separated infinitely distant firmament began show perceptible disk

heavily laden though vessel power soon dropping vertically toward large lagoon middle nevian city 
bit open water strangely devoid life ordinary landing 
terrific power beams braking descent unimaginable load allotropic iron water seethed boiled instead floating gracefully upon surface sea time huge ship space sank like plummet bottom 
accomplished delicate feat docking vessel safely immense cradle prepared nerado turned terrestrials guard brought 
cargo iron discharged take three tellurians college science undergo thorough physical psychological examination 
follow 
wait minute protested costigan quick furtive wink companions 
expect us go water frightful depth certainly replied nevian surprise 
air breathers course must able swim little slight depth little thirty meters trouble 
wrong twice declared terrestrial convincingly 
swimming mean propelling water know nothing 
water heads drown helplessly minute two pressure depth would kill us instantly 
well could take lifeboat course nevian captain began doubtfully broke sound staccato call signal panel 
captain nerado attention nerado acknowledged microphone 
third city attacked fishes greater deeps 
developed new powerful mobile fortresses mounting unheard weapons city reports long withstand attack 
inhabitants asking possible help 
vessel vast stores iron also mounts weapons power

go back quarters stay send nevian directed terrestrials obeyed curt orders fish shaped cruiser space tore water flashed crimson sky 
barefaced liar bradley exclaimed 
three transformers cut back middle room suite 
outswim otter happen know came old dz depth maybe exaggerate trifle costigan interrupted helpless thinks better us 
want stay cities long may hard places escape 
got couple ideas ripe enough pick yet wow bird traveling already hits water going like split sure undiminished velocity flashing downward long slant toward beleaguered third city flying vessel launched toward city central lagoon torpedo 
missile capsule containing full ton allotropic iron would use nevian defenders millions men 
third city sore pressed indeed 
around one unbroken ring boiling exploding water water billowing upward searing blinding bursts superheated steam hurled bodily directions solid masses cataclysmic forces released embattled fishes greater deeps

well think right best chance ever something 
costigan turned away absorbing scenes pictured upon visiplate faced two companions 
possibly asked clio whatever try bradley exclaimed 
anything better staying letting analyze us telling us costigan went 
know lot things think 
never catch using spy ray awfully narrow beam know uses almost power able dope quite lot stuff 
open locks know run small boats 
battle fantastic deadly stuff one sided means either every one nerado seems emergency duty 
guards watching us stationed want go way open 
battle giving us best possible chance get away 
much emission already probably detect driving rays lifeboat busy chase us anyway 
asked bradley eagerly 
decide start course 
say make break back solarian system 
know direction observation plenty power 
good heavens conway far exclaimed clio 
food water air would ever get know much 
think course anything might happen 
ship none big considerable slower big space ship long ways home 
another bad thing food question 
boat well stocked according nevian ideas pretty foul stuff us eat 
however nourishing eat since carry enough supplies boat last long 
even may go short rations think able make 
hand happens stay certainly strike trouble sooner later know much ultra weapons 
land dwellers mighty little land planet 
know look little land even could find know run amphibians already 
lot things might better might lot worse 
try stay try exclaimed clio bradley one 
right 
better waste time talking let go stepping locked shielded door took peculiarly built torch pointed briefly nevian lock 
light noise massive portal swung smoothly open 
stepped costigan relocked reshielded entrance 
clio demanded almost stuttering surprise 
going school last weeks costigan grinned picked quite things literally well figuratively speaking

misadventures terrestrials gained entrance nevian lifeboat costigan first act disconnect one steel boot armor space 
sigh relief pulled foot carefully poured small power tank craft fully thirty pounds allotropic iron pinched explained answer amazed inquiring looks maybe think relief get boot steal flask carry place could put 
lifeboats equipped couple grams iron apiece know get half way back tellus even smooth going may fight 
much go though could go andromeda fighting way 
well better break away 
costigan watched plate closely maneuvering great vessel brought exit port far away possible third city warring citadels deep shot little cruiser away 
straight ocean sped murky red veil darted upward toward surface 
three wanderers sat tense hardly daring breathe staring plates clio bradley pushing metal levers stepping hard upon metal brakes unconscious efforts help costigan dodge beams rods death flashing appallingly close upon sides 
water air darting dodging lifeboat flashed safety air supposedly free menace came disaster 
crunching grating shock vessel thrown dizzy spiral costigan finally leveled headlong flight away scene battle 
watching pyrometers recorded temperature outer shell drove lifeboat ahead highest safe atmospheric speed bradley went inspect damage 
pretty bad better thought captain reported 
outer inner plates broken away seam 
inter wall vacuum lost hold carpet rags let alone air 
tools aboard got make costigan declared 
put lot distance behind us fix get away 
fish anyway conway clio asked lifeboat tore along 
nevians bad enough heaven knows idea intelligent educated fish enough drive one mad know nerado mentioned several times semi civilized fishes greater deeps reminded 
gather least three intelligent races 
know two nevians amphibians fishes greater deeps 
fishes lesser deeps also intelligent 
get nevian cities originally built shallow water perhaps upon islands 
development machinery tools gave big edge fish living shallow seas nearest islands gradually became tributary nations actually slaves 
fish serve food work mines hatcheries plantations kinds work nevians 
called lesser deeps conquered first course races fish docile enough 
deep sea breeds live water deep nevians hardly stand pressure intelligent start stubborn besides 
valuable metals deep planet light size know nevians kept conquered deep sea fish put em work 
high pressure boys nobody fools 
realized time went amphibians would get ahead development let conquered learned use nevians tools everything else could get hold developed lot new stuff wipe amphibians slate completely get far ahead handle 
nevians afraid want kill fast possibly guessed clio 
would logical thing course commented bradley 
got pretty nearly enough distance costigan enough distance planet suit costigan replied 
need get 
full diameter away crew amphibians close comfort detectors keen 
detect us clio asked 
oh wish hit us away long ago 
costigan assented feelingly 
use squawking 
rivet weld seams pump shell fill air tanks capacity trip anyway 
things could lot worse still breathing air silence lifeboat flashed onward half nevia mighty globe traversed brought halt emptiest reaches planet desolate watery waste

lifeboat lay motionless upon mirror smooth surface ocean 
captain bradley opened upper port three stood opening gazing silence toward incredibly distant horizon powerful pumps forcing last possible ounces air practically unbreakable storage cylinders 
mile upon strangely flat mile stretched waveless unbroken expanse water merging finally violent redness nevian sky

however takes us much deeper go work 
getting pretty close limit bottom long way yet 
deeper deeper lifeboat dragged dreadful opponent whose spiked teeth still tore savagely tough outer plating craft costigan reluctantly threw power switches 
full propellant thrust monster could draw lower neither could lifeboat make headway toward surface 
terrestrial turned rays found ineffective 
closely creature wrapped around submarine weapons could brought bear upon without melting vessel outer skin 
possibly anyway clio asked

yes pilot replied 
come shortest possible time meant velocity check without spiral 
however even saved lot time 
save quite bit though rocket plane come meet us somewhere around fifteen twenty thousand kilometers depending upon want land

better wait back hill 
full set ultra screens around 
couple good reasons would better us go whole thing virgil ground talking anyway 
orders get back maximum know means aboard sliver

giving us eh cleveland asked 
something new fred yes high powered ultra wave spy rodenbush returned 
light simply warning carried desired 
also carry voice vision like samms voice interrupted powerful dynamic speaker upon pilots panel clear cut face appeared upon television screen 
suppose fred thought mention one inventions last days 
trying 
mean thing though far sliver concerned

right way norma rodebush paused briefly desk chief private secretary even spoken pressed button door behind swung wide 
two need announced attractive young woman smiled 
go right 
samms met door eagerly shaking hands particularly vigorously cleveland 
congratulations camera lyman exclaimed 
wonderful piece work 
help smokes sit lot things want talk 
pictures carried story would left us pretty much sea without costigan reports 
fred crew worked answers dope two got got yet soon 
nothing new conway cleveland almost afraid ask question 
shadow came samms face 
afraid hoping creatures whatever taken far away reach us 
certainly far away reach 
rodenbush volunteered 
even get ultra wave interference 
yes hopeful sign samms went 
hate think conway costigan checking 
fellows real observer 
man ever known combined two qualities perfect witness 
could actually see everything looked could report truly last least detail 
take stuff instance especially ability transform iron fluid allotrope form use intra atomic energy power 
something brand new unheard except ravings imaginative fiction yet described converters projectors minutely fred able work underlying theory three days tie super ship 
first thought rebuild iron free fred showed error found first course 
good make ship non ferrous unless could change blood chemistry could get along without hemoglobin would quite feat cleveland agreed 
vital electrical machinery built around iron cores 
develop screen forces screens rather powerful drive anything 
working along lines ever since reported rodebush said beginning see light 
connection wonder handle super ship 
good ideas wrongly applied 
however things look quite promising 
transformation iron worked theory soon get generator going straighten everything else short order 
think unlimited power means power want power enough even try hitherto purely theoretical possibilities neutralization gravity even inertia matter hold protested samms 
certainly inertia must basic attribute matter surely done away without destroying matter 
start anything like 
fred want lose lyman 
worry us chief 
rodebush replied smile 
tell matter fundamentally may agree well surprised anything happens 
going lot things nobody ever thought 
thus long time argument discussion went interrupted voice secretary 
sorry disturb mr samms things come handle 
knobos calling near mars 
caught endymion killed half crew 
milton finally reported venus touch five days 
trailed wintons thalleron swamp 
crashed went 
got flash fletcher asteroid belt 
think finally traced dope line 
knobos want endymion tell put better tell samms directed face hardened ruthless decision horny misshapen face martian lieutenant appeared upon screen 
think knobos shall come trial think either 
better gangsters disappear space run risk another uprising 
see 
right 
screen darkened samms spoke secretary 
put milton fletcher whenever rays come 
turned guests 
covered ground quite thoroughly 
good bye wish could go pretty well tied next week two 
tied half express rodebush remarked two scientists walked along corridor toward elevator 
probably busiest man three planets 
well powerful cleveland supplemented 
men could use power fairly welcome far concerned 
pink fantods month done part day work 
mean endymion else could nothing talking 
done since bringing trial would probably mean killing half people morseca time ghastly thing order job deliberate cold blooded illegal murder 
right course would broke unable put thoughts words 
inarticulate manlike concerning deepest emotions men ingrained code organization knew every man chosen service everything nothing 
enough plenty grief right rodebush changed subject abruptly stepped vast room almost filled immense bulk boise sinister space ship although never flown already lined black many pages triplanetary roster 
however center furious activity 
men swarmed orderly confusion fiercely driven carefully planned program reconstruction 
hope dope right fred cleveland called two scientists separated go respective laboratories 
make perfect lady unmanageable man killer yet chapter viii super ship launched weeks ceaseless work lavished upon every resource mind material afforded three planets boise ready maiden flight 
nearly ready thought labor man could make 
rodebush cleveland finished last rigid inspection craft standing beside center door main airlock talking chief 
say think safe yet take crew samms argued 
case safe enough men either 
need badly permit take chances 
got let us go ones thoroughly familiar theory rodebush insisted 
said still say think safe 
prove however except mathematically altogether full many new untried mechanisms many extrapolations beyond existing possible data 
theoretically sound know theory go far mathematically negligible factors may become operative velocities 
need crew short trip 
take care minor mishaps fundamental theories wrong crews jupiter good 
therefore two going alone 
well careful anyway 
start slow take easy 
start slow neutralize half gravity half inertia matter got everything nothing soon neutralizers go 
could start projectors course instead neutralizers prove anything would prolong agony 
well careful 
chief cleveland put 
think lot us committing suicide yet help 
remember everybody staying inside take barely possible take lot room
