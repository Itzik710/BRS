skraelingers heard stopped abruptly man one leg leg arms less extended suddenly petrified 
truth horror meet open enemy however powerful would pleasure compared slow nervous advance midst dead silence nothing followed sound however suspended legs began descend slowly towards ground leif sneezed greenland icy mountains become one monstrous polar bear whose powers voice frozen prolonged ages last found vent night one concentrated roar noise could scarcely excelled instantly exploded norsemen

pretty near cliff round path turned put modern sporting phraseology termed spurt came close flying band rear began glance despairingly shoulders 
suddenly leif gave vent roar threw remaining strength 
taken prolonged men 
horror struck skraelingers shrieked reply swept like torrent round projecting cliff disappeared leif stopped held hand 
men stopped short also though heard skraelingers still howling fled one followed farther 
indeed norsemen panting vehemently rather glad otherwise allowed halt 
however two young men among tall strong boned thin broad shoulders grave earnest though exactly handsome countenances appeared perfectly cool good wind long run 
leif noticed

chapter four 
important events transpire end voyage discovery 
weeks afterwards karlsefin gudrid went walk together sea beach 
would appear lovers fond rambling together olden times modern days 
evening went ramble thus another evidence similarity taste moderns ancients 
karlsefin said gudrid stopping margin fiord looking pensively towards horizon golden clouds air sea appeared mingle harmoniously wonder good ships many stout men plenty means choose remain barren spot instead searching famous vinland making settlement 
barren spot bright gudrid desire leave yet 
since betrothed ocean lost attractions 
besides would set voyage discovery beginning winter 
nay even talk going spring comes round 
things talk gudrid 
fear lazy man returned widow smile prove sorry husband 
think added sudden animation splendid country must desirable change us 
thick leafy woods like old norway instead rugged cliffs snow clad hills 
fields waving grass rye instead moss covered rocks sandy soil 
trees large enough build houses merchant ships instead willow bushes fit nothing except save poor cattle starvation hay crop runs besides longer sunshine winter genial warmth year round instead howling winds ice snow 
truly think adopted home woefully misnamed 
yet love gudrid find atmosphere genial sunshine bright 
foolish man said gudrid little laugh 
added recurring theme grapes though sure know never tasted 
biarne says good think magnificent answered karlsefin 
southern lands tyrker comes process whereby make drink grapes maddens youth quickens pulse age something like beer 
please hear replied gudrid gravely carls fond beer 
old heriulf sick little good eric red last days seemed gather little strength comfort beer never could perceive ever anything young men except make boast talk nonsense look foolish worse quarrel fight 
right gudrid right said karlsefin opinion least whether right wrong 
reason applying heat cold seems unnecessary add heat warmth artificial strength natural vigor dangerous sometimes add fuel fire 
glad think think point well man wife agreed matters importance 
return vinland thinking much since came though saying little becomes man silent circumspect regard unformed plans 
mind go thither next spring one condition

perchance may find mistaken said thorward 
since free warnings let remind although course courtship runs smooth old proverb descended odin believe assures us true love never run 
recall words thorward congratulate true love assuredly courtship runs uncommonly rugged course 
thorward turned heel walked away towering passion 
happened drawing near brattalid met biarne coming opposite direction 
nothing could pleased better state mind time would turned savagely possible order relieve feelings 
cried confronting biarne well met tell biarne didst thou poison ears freydissa telling courting thy cousin astrid biarne aware consequences said jest felt inclined laugh checked flushed somewhat accustomed addressed haughty tones

laid hand upon sword biarne said quietly go sir turning round hastened hamlet 
thorward could scarcely believe eyes biarne fully stout somewhat taller besides look courageous man 
issued imperative mandate defiance challenge anything else gazed retreating biarne mingled feelings surprise contempt pity surprise predominated 
long wait however ten minutes biarne returned 
well told replied biarne 
hah exclaimed thorward much perplexed knowing say next 
thorward said biarne momentary pause methinks must fight 
heart answered thorward much relieved grasping sword 
nay weapons said biarne stepping weapons friendship 
bestowed hearty buffet thorward left ear turned irascible man head heels laid full length sand 
thorward rose slowly somewhat stunned confused impression something wrong head 
quite recovered biarne burst laugh seized hand 
freydissa bids tell said paused 
pause intentional 
saw thorward point snatching away hand returning blow drawing sword restrained order hear freydissa message

winter karlsefin married gudrid thorward freydissa following spring embarked karlsefin ship large party men women children cattle set sail vinland 
chapter five 
freydissa shows temper whale checks poetical touches 
expedition set vinland much larger scale expeditions preceded 
biarne leif acted part discoverers colonisers although previous parties passed several winters vinland intended take permanent abode plain fact brought neither women flocks herds 
karlsefin contrary went forth fully equipped colonisation 
ship said large one decked poop forecastle fitted brave tempestuous weather least well fitted ships columbus capable accommodating hundred people 
took sixty men five women besides wife thorward thorward biarne accompanied expedition also olaf inexpressible joy leif preferred remain home promised take good care thorward ship left behind

rowers labor much sea vessel times able advance sail 
calms however going creeks landing also doubling capes wind suitable oars greatest value 
karlsefin principal people slept high poop 
number men slept forecastle rest lay waist near cattle sheltered weather tents awnings called tilts 
may perhaps surprise readers learn men could venture vessels cross northern seas norway iceland thence greenland surprising consider small size vessels columbus afterwards crossed atlantic safety reflect norsemen long accustomed vessels traverse ocean around coasts europe directions round shores britain baltic away faroe islands mediterranean even far black sea 
short norsemen old magnificent seamen question much ultimate success britain sea due insular position also insufficiently appreciated fact blood hardy adventurous vikings norway still flows veins 
splendid spring morning karlsefin hoisted white blue sail dropped ericsfiord favoring breeze leif people stood stone jetty brattalid waved hats shawls departing friends 
olaf thora bertha first voyage vessel gradually left land behind latter stood stern gazing wistfully towards shore tears flowed pretty blue eyes chased fair round face bertha left old father behind greenland

although arrested thus suddenly unexpectedly progress toward shore resolute norsemen balked intention reaching land forenoon morning vessel stuck fast shallows 
tide ebbing time karlsefin knew would impossible get ship next flood tide 
therefore waited till water low enough waded land accompanied large band men

nevertheless would satisfaction make positively certain right way may sending one two men land following river come lake leif built booths bring us back news 
meanwhile explore country till return 
biarne thorward thought advice good offered lead party sent 
said thorward may meet natives natives bear resemblance skraelingers methinks receive us much civility

comrades explore neighborhood together advisable ascertain nature new country quickly may 
needful also without scattering lest set upon unexpectedly lurking foe

first american fur traders strange devices anxious times pleasant discoveries 
business colony progressed admirably 
large house erected central hall numerous sleeping rooms closets chief people dwelt together number men messed daily 
grass found abundance large quantity cut stacked winter use although good reason believe winter would mild cattle might left forage 
salmon also caught great numbers little river main stream lake doors 
consume dried smoked stored

eggs found islands offshore feathers collected early summer enough wherewith load ship 
among discoveries found grain growing wild 
saga writers called wheat open question whether wild rice large quantities grow uninhabited parts america present time 
also found beautiful kind wood called massurwood samples sent greenland norway wood really tell 
meanwhile extensive traffic valuable furs commenced natives satisfied scraps bright cloth beads trifling ornaments received exchange 
natives wanted purchase weapons furs karlsefin would allow 
first norsemen gave cloth wares exchange liberal hand cutting bright cloth stripes three four inches breadth soon found rate supplies would become exhausted early year 
therefore reduced prices began give stripes cloth two inches width last reduced measure one inch furs previously fetched four 
unsophisticated natives quite content change appeared enjoy nothing much twist stripes cloth long black hair

business however record facts rather carp therefore let snorro pass without comment 
little body attached little voice although far beautiful first object intense affection parents regard almost amounting veneration rugged men surrounded 
bertha declared enthusiastically perfectly lovely although obvious unprejudiced eyes resembled nothing much piece wrinkled beef bad color astrid declared wise look despite evident fact expression little short idiotical karlsefin said nothing smiled good deal chucked place chin ought great forefinger timid way 
snorro deemed sufficiently far advanced life handed public exhibition greatest number falsehoods uttered quietest deliberation although say truth greater number men said nothing contented taking infant big rough hands delicately thought bubble feared might burst leave nothing handed back thora acted part nurse

olaf pace regulated spirits snorro soon began pant suddenly pulled violent top ho tired cried olaf seizing throwing shoulder old position 
well go went run went track also point struck across country straight woods direction certain ridge limit beyond forbidden go 
elevated ridge commanded fine view surrounding country higher tree tops favorite resort olaf went ramble snorro 
beyond lay land unknown olaf part forest dense even men avoided expeditions selected open easier routes 
olaf allowed accompany men short excursions never gone beyond ridge direction 
longed however many time playing snorro ridge gazed ever increasing curiosity deep shades beyond wondered gaze forbidden object dangerous 
already said olaf trustworthy boy immaculate

error number one 
smelling forbidden fruit sure prelude eating took child back descended hill entered thick forest 
scene met gaze indeed well calculated delight romantic boy 
found part woods immediately around consisted tall straight trees thick umbrageous tops stems seemed like pillars supporting vast roof stems could see vista smaller stems appeared absolutely endless 
grass ground species soft moss sank ankle deep yet deep render walking difficult 
one direction distance looked intensely blue another almost black long way bright sunny spot appeared glittering waters pond midst 
whole scene beautiful strange olaf would filled intense delight could got rid uncomfortable feeling forbidden ground however fairly got scrape thought might well go 
error number two

well might one say burnt finger shove whole body fire olaf take time think 
pushed boldly forward direction lake 
drew near found moss becoming softer deeper besides rather wet 
going steps found changed swamp 
ho snorrie dangerous ground said turning back take round try get lake drier way 
diverged towards dry ground swamp force one side compelled go sight pond altogether 
vexin said looking

well get lake rather wild place turn back get fast

olaf turned back made edge wood 
long coming began somewhat surprised looked little carefully tall straight stems much alike afforded clue way wood 
young though olaf knew enough woodcraft able steer course sun sky become clouded direction sun could ascertained dense foliage overhead 
became seriously alarmed 
heart beat ribs wanted get started run direction felt sure ridge lay 
becoming tired still alarmed changed course eagerly advanced short time hesitated changed course finally stopped altogether terrible fact flashed upon really lost woods 
set snorro ground sitting beside burst tears 
need scarcely say poor olaf neither timid effeminate boy 
thus gave way 
sudden opening eyes terrible consequences disobedience unmanned 
quick mind perceived little snorro would soon die cold hunger failed find way wilderness thought awful misery would thus descend heads karlsefin gudrid felt strange desire might die 
state mind however last long 
soon dried eyes braced another effort 
snorro gone sleep instant laid ground 
luckless guide raised opened eyes slightly murmured af went land nod 
olaf made steady persevering effort get wood far successful came ground open broken like accustomed travel men 
encouraged greatly although recognize part believed must events far distant places knew 
looked sun sky become thickly overcast could make position 
laying snorro climbed tall tree prospect interminable forest beheld point vantage afford clue locality 
looked ridge many ridges view might ridge none looked precisely like 
nevertheless upward bound spirits taken came open country altogether subside 
still wandered manfully hope gradually nearing home 
last evening approached light began fade away 
olaf convinced spend night forest 
therefore wisely resolved yet day search suitable place whereon encamp instead struggling till could go farther 
fortunately weather warm time 
ere long found small hollow sand bank perfectly dry thickly overhung shrubs 
crept carefully laid slumbering charge 
going collected large quantity leaves 
made couch laid snorro covered well 
lying beside drew close child could placed little head breast keep warm laid curly pate piece turf almost instantly fell profound slumber 
sun birds singing long slumber broken 
last olaf little charge awoke yawned several times stretched vigorously opened eyes difficulty began look round half formed notions breakfast 
olaf first observe roof confused mass earth roots instead customary plank ceiling cross beams home 
murmured lazily yet look sleepy curiosity 
evidently puzzled saying long might lain condition small contented voice close beside replied af 
olaf raised quickly elbow looking observed snorro large eyes gazing forest leaves quiet satisfaction 
nice continued snorro

nice snorrie little man nice 
dread ful awful come must give way like big baby yesterday 
lost snorrie lost woods

milk eh well sure olaf stopped abruptly greatly perplexed matter breakfast thus suggested chanced moment look towards leafy entrance cave beheld pair large black eyes glaring 
say poor olaf heart gave violent leap apparently ceased beat altogether blood fled visage say anything disparaging courage 
whether boy man reader suspect similar circumstances beheld pair eyes might troubled somewhat similar emotions 
cowardice lies susceptibility nervous system shock giving way shock become unfit proper action self defense 
olaf coward would forgetting else attempted fly impossible would shrunk innermost recesses cave 
coward first impulse start feet face pair eyes second put left arm round snorro still keeping white face steadily turned foe draw child close side

soon little snorro became silent combined effects exhaustive squeezes horror 
thus promptly brought matters seemed consider satisfactory condition savage wiping roman nose bled little threw snorro shoulder seizing olaf collar coat thrust advance left cavern rapid strides 
words describe condition poor olaf mind thus forced violently along forest knew whither 
fearful thoughts went flashing swiftly brain 
savage would take snorro home wherever might kill roast eat one mildest thoughts 
reflected hatred savage towards must intense consequence recent treatment nose pain feature would infallibly keep hatred long time boiling point addition roasting eating referred every reason expect case addition little extra torture 
thought fact little snorro would never behold mother torture mind resulting reflection comparable roasting body worst thought dreadful pass snorro come consequence wilful disobedience anguish spirit filled reflected caused almost forget pain caused savage knuckles neck savage prospects future 
oh longed knife fearful gloating contemplate exact spot savage groin would plunged haft disappeared much feeling revenge though bad enough intense desire rescue snorro ere late 
several times thought final dying effort hand hand struggle captor power grip back neck induced abandon idea despair

suddenly however recurred reflecting could manage make escape might perhaps find way back settlement give alarm lead friends snorro rescue 
power thought strong upon suddenly stooped gave active body twist considered absolutely awful strength much astonishment find free 
contrary received shake accompanied kick moment felt hope gone 
thus proceeded woods upon open space beyond variety ridges number hollows several forests unlike first poor olaf began wonder whether passed boundaries world altogether got another region beyond legs sturdy though began give way beneath noon day sun shone perpendicularly trees felt burning brain 
came rivulet banks seen several tents conical form made skins tops smoke issuing 
sooner savage come sight tents uttered low peculiar cry 
responded immediately band half naked savages like advanced meet 
much gesticulation loud excited talking great deal pointing two captives looks expressive surprise delight word could olaf understand gestures definite expression 
snorro placed sitting wise ground nearly half dead fatigue alarm hunger crept towards olaf hid face breast sobbed 
olaf conscience wake afresh stab degree vigor absolutely awful olaf conscience tender one strange almost paradoxical fact tenderer conscience wrathfully stab lacerate heart owner done wrong however uncertainty disposition savages thorough inspection children took tents set boiled fish roast venison

wonder evening night half day abstinence looked longing gaze victuals opportunity offered devoured desperately 
olaf though trained little endurance scarcely less energetic appetite keen fast unusually prolonged 
eaten much could delight natives excepting course man temporary roman nose ordered signals even snorro understood remain still behave 
thereafter natives struck tents packed goods chattels embarked sixteen large canoes descended rivulet hundred yards spot flowed large river 
turned canoes upstream silently swiftly paddled away interior land

sojourn regions said sent many exploring parties pretty well acquainted nature country within fifty miles directions 
expeditions however conducted chiefly land one water 
one consisted solitary canoe manned four men heika steersman hake managed bow paddle proved party apt learn use paddle management canoe 
fight savages recorded previous chapter brothers observed man sat bow quite much importance regard steering sat stern afterwards ascended river found necessary shoot hither thither amongst surges cross currents eddies rapid discovered simple steering one end frail bark would suffice necessary steer ends 
sometimes order avoid stone dangerous whirlpool violent shoot became necessary turn canoe almost center pivot least within length order accomplish steersman dip paddle far one side possible draw stern direction bowman opposite side drew bow way thus causing light craft spin round almost instantly 
two guiding men thus acted unison thoroughly understanding conceivable situations good safe steering could achieved 
canoes captured savages frail barks literal sense words 
made bark birch tree substance though tough easily split insomuch single touch upon stone sufficient cause bad leak 
hence utmost care required navigation 
although thus easily damaged also easily repaired materials reparation even necessary reconstruction always hand forest 
although heika brother said remarkably expert follow equally managed two canoes expedition 
contrary experience canoeing hitherto slight 
karlsefin bowman krake indeed tolerably expert practiced good deal scottish brothers thorward turned uncommonly bad canoe man nevertheless self confidence natural good seaman one expert oar scouted idea anything connected fresh water voyaging could prove difficult resolutely claimed took position one steersmen expedition 
bowman tyrker ill luck would turned worst man rough water although shown sufficiently good smooth lake induce belief might well enough 
various powers respect first put test long way river uninterrupted rapids progress therefore comparatively easy 
scenery passed rich varied extreme 
one part river ran high banks covered water edge trees bushes different kinds many exceedingly brilliant color

leif glad learn returning fort two dead men discovered ground 
savages given means became pretty clear noise made woods soon afterwards

however go upon spit sand olaf snorro first observed friends 
point high stream seem considered one worthy attention 
karlsefin observed formed plans accordingly 
advanced land spit made hostile demonstrations kind paddled quietly nearing shore savages seem understand although ready arrows instant action remained passive 
within short distance land karlsefin suddenly still quietly turned head canoe stream made spit sand 
canoes followed 
natives perceiving intention strangers uttered wild shout made place along shore reached karlsefin landed men stalwart figures strange arms presented imposing front natives stopped short 
point crowd opened little let one pass whitepow came front

advice said thorward hesitate longer 
stand fall fight sooner begin better 
doubt odds great seem able much least old chap gave us good specimen powers 
norsemen appeared agree advice karlsefin 
forget said would mere trial strength 
begin chance fail every man us must die colony thus left weak would stand small chance surviving midst many savages 
besides children would lost ever opinion wait little see movement implies 
perhaps white haired old savage may recovered temper senses time making mind peace instead war 
god grant may 
instead replying thorward frowned darkly something savage sneer lip pointed bend river round moment hundred canoes swept came swiftly towards

karlsefin therefore tried hand little gesticulation natives gazed speechless interest 
whitepow utway replied variety energetic demonstrations norseman understood others could make nothing result utway made final proposal clear effect norsemen approach savages mingle friends
