dr arthur voice face shewed sudden check 
see said rollo eyes seemed would deny fact sheer force 
eyes glanced hitherto shyly withholding 
looked full face using old wistful girlish right search watching keenly sometimes watched 
answered gravely could dr arthur mistaken says saw true came astonished fiery glance gray eyes 
draw little stepping back 
true since says saw among rest 
often see man lose color intense feeling 
wych hazel eyes saw 
rollo stood still quite still space time neither could measure growing pale time lines lip brow gradually took firmer firmer set 
motionless iron statue assuming fixedness one stood minute minute slipped 
wych hazel time probably seemed measureless endless rollo struggle tumultuous whirl feeling single sharp point existence 
stood eyes cast without raising without uttering another syllable suppose self control last bowed gravely low turned away 
another minute bay horse rider went past door gone 
part wych hazel stood waiting expecting speak scanning face eager scrutiny 
grave shadow disappointment upon looked nerving words anger must follow look 
turned raised head quickly looked following eyes long eyes could follow listening long ears could hear drew veil face went entered carriage 
answering somehow mr falkirk words somehow taking part mrs powder festivities 
interminable length bridges life point life point must sometimes pass foot pace anything intolerable monotonous tramp tramp meaningless steps anything sickening easy sway bridge seems make whole world reel truth wych hazel asked afterwards mrs powder said came home could told word 
came home scarlet spot either cheek burning brighter brighter 
beautiful people said

one day followed another still came even message wych hazel waited 
one guessed little eat days one guessed little slept one thing knew earthly temptation could made leave house five minutes 
rose early might come sat till impossible hours lest might ones left free business 
watching keen three pointed pain never relaxed pressure 
use anything yet longed coming intensity could measured 
earlier year certainly declaration would waited long without taking matter hands writing 
twenty fifth close hand could anything bring notice call side almost stranger seen since near year ago 
twenty fifth least must see 
alas could say unless

rollo come chickaree write 
long wych could borne wait without writing clear difficult say 
week passed second week progress twenty fifth week mr falkirk announced dinner one day rollo setting upon journey 
going see great manufacturing establishment northeast somewhere attend business tells fifth sixth next month hopes back time

strange double life leading late wych hazel heard mr falkirk announcement poured dinner coffee steady hand 
asked mr rollo go 
gone already day 
till must business wait till second week october

earthly thing would kept away twenty fifth without even word 
could done unless liking changed would done caring thought cared year ago questions beating back forth mind went though rest day 
receiving visiters giving mr falkirk tea sitting evening last done gone could alone 
never even crossed mind go bed night 
whatever new day may things sure yet rather gentle uncertainties making fair little suggestions giving stray touches light way altogether hopeful beguiling 
weary moonlight night spent glitter tender dawn came hazel breathed free new thought

would wait see 
use trusting people keep watch 
though secret pain heart never disappear though best next meeting mr rollo could pleasant still hazel hold head hope wait woman ready faith courage died twilight revived dawn kept fever suspense expectation 
wearied unspeakably long hours practical daylight unmanageable night sometimes could hardly bear 
world seemed turn round till could catch thoughts nerves overstrung watch made start grow pale commonest little sounds every day every night 
never many people love never loved anybody much truth dignity kept forms love trifling kept hidden treasures heart sparkling freshness 
never passed hand hand weather stains worn impressions 
amount might wych hazel never guessed dark days began tell making feel poor use treasure nobody wants least among troubles painful hiding 
must laugh talk entertain mr falkirk must guard face mail bag came steady little hand stretched letters must meet turn mrs bywank looks words must dress go dress receive people home 
ah hard one could speak lap could lay head pour sorrows 
slowly days went hope grew fainter dawn turned cold grew wych hazel mind intense longing lay hold something still something would stand something beyond wind waves slowly gradually words read gyda came back made power mind trouble 
oh one oh something could grasp stop endless swaying rocking trembling things else following close came words lately learned 
read pencil marks beside read often enough happily learned heart passing passing unceasing procession thoughts 
love christ constraineth us 
love could counted presence sure reaching hands blindly dark girl lay hold eternal strength sometimes found rest
