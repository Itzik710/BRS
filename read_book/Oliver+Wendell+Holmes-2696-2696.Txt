million kind golden cheese represents compendious form summer growth fat meadow craft commerce kind meadow rarely bears one crop pretty certain sons grandsons get another golden cheese whether milk cows turn new ones 
words millionocracy considered large way affair persons families perpetual fact money variable human element philosopher might leave consideration without falling serious error

rockland place 
natural features town described already 
mountain course gave character redeemed wearing commonplace expression belongs ordinary country villages 
beautiful wild invested mystery belongs untrodden spaces enough terror give dignity yet closer relations town brooded passing stranger knew 
thus made local climate cutting northern winds holding sun heat like garden wall 
peachtrees northern side mountain hardly ever came fruit ripened abundant crops rockland 
still another relation mountain town foot strangers likely hear alluded oftener thought spoken inhabitants 
high impending forests hangers white selborne would called sloping far upward backward distance always air menace blended wild beauty 
seemed heaven scaling titan thrown shaggy robe bare precipitous flanks rocky summit might moment slide like garment flung carelessly nearest chance support sliding crush village rossberg tumbled valley goldau 
persons known remove place short residence haunted day night thought awful green wall piled air heads

yet one strange contradictions constantly finding human nature natives town would come back thirty forty years leaving nestle threatening mountainside old men sun southward facing walls 
old dreams legends danger added attraction 
mountain ever slide kind feeling ought 
fascination like rattlesnake said exert 
comparison naturally suggests recollection source danger element every day life rockland people

rockland features helped give special character 
first one grand street chief glory 
elm street called naturally enough elms made long pointed arched gallery extent

spring one finds crop baby elms among carrots parsnips weak small compared succulent vegetables 
baby elms die slain unrecognized unheeded hand hoe meekly herod innocents

mr fairweather settled place ten years heard strange hint elsie never considered anything idle ignorant malicious village gossip 
fully understood perverse unmanageable child extraordinary care bestowed far thrown away dangerous self willed girl feared almost shunned carried malignant influence

maybe questioned whether views interfered sound training certain young persons sons clergymen others 
nearer mind possibility educating children shall become good christians without violent transition 
hope bringing nurture admonition lord 
younger minister looked puzzled presently answered possibly may called attention neglected truths fear must go old school want get root matter
