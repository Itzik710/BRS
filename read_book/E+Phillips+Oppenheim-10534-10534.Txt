beyond one step taken 
last goal well within reach 
woman right recommenced conversation moment interrupted 
speaking success said 
success often comes one covered tentacles parasites shame yet even grosser forms something splendid 
success carries apparent drawback whatever course amazing thing 
reading wonderful article professor wilson last month 
quotes extensively 
analysis character way interesting 
directly read however felt lacked one thing simplicity 
made mind next time talked intimately would ask attributed success hebblethwaite smiled graciously 
attempt answer epigrams replied 
pay passing tribute wonderful constitution invincible sense humor think help one keep one head many trying conditions 
real final explanation success embraced popular cause 
came people entered politics told every one else people work 
never swerved purpose 
people owe whatever success enjoying day 
duchess nodded thoughtfully 
yes admitted right 
shall proceed train thought quite honestly shall count compliment assured earnestly even thoughts contain criticisms 
occupy great position political life day continued one forced consider especially view future politician every point view 
showing specialist 
taken cause people classes 
stripped many us possessions duke know hates sound name legislation without doubt improved welfare many millions human beings 
great politician must achieve empire across seas 
imperialism declared never foreground program call imperialist 
done could colonies 
even abandoned behalf pet principles absolute freedom trade 
certainly prejudiced admitted 
whether politics imperialist broadest point view well discuss question 
might perhaps differ 
one point 
zealously whole career set face steadfastly increase military power 
say chiefly due mr busby army day weaker numbers years 
set face steadily schemes national service 
taken stand england afford remain neutral whatever combination powers continent may fight 
tell see possibility failure standpoint great politician attitude answered 
contrary proud done direction 
reduction armaments accept full responsibility 
true opposed national service 
want see people develop commercially 
withdrawing million young men even month every year regular tasks would mean serious loss manufacturing community would apt unsettle unsteady 
would kindle country one thing anxious avoid military spirit 
need duchess 
peace loving nation civilised crude lust conquest founded upon bloodshed 
believe geographically every point view england navy afford fold arms nations time foolish enough imperil existence fighting conquest revenge strong enough remain aloof grow richer stronger disasters happen 
momentary silence 
duchess leaned back chair mr hebblethwaite always courteous host talked woman left 
duchess however reopened subject minutes later 
come must remember mr hebblethwaite observed long generations soldiers reminded long race yeomen tradespeople 
therefore without doubt point view must different 
perhaps makes conversation us interesting 
conflict europe sooner later appears inevitable 
england preserving haughty insular neutrality present military condition would almost compulsory struggle would russia france italy germany austria 
russia unknown force mind see austria italy perhaps one german army holding back many months perhaps indefinitely 
hand see france overrun germans much 
adore french little sympathy germans fighting race reluctantly feel must admit superiority germans 
well 
ostend calais boulogne havre seized germany certainly would turned naval bases still believe england security would wholly provided fleet mr hebblethwaite smiled 
duchess said sooner later felt quite sure conversation would draw near german bogey 
picture draw menacing enough 
look upon probability exactly par overrunning europe yellow races 
believe sincerity germany asked 
admitted firmly 
military element germany regretted germans splendid cultured peace loving people seeking future point sword counting houses world 
fear germans commercially point view 
wish could feel confidence duchess sighed 
recently returned berlin mr hebblethwaite continued 
busby know many times honored guest universities great cities 
every opportunity probing tendencies people 
mind absolutely finally made 
history ever existed race freer lust bloodthirsty conquest german people day 
mr hebblethwaite concluded sentence emphasis 
felt words carrying conviction 
conversation end table broken listen pronouncements 
moment butler touched upon elbow 
mr bedells come war office sir announced 
waiting outside 
meantime desired give 
butler served archbishop resented often presence establishment radical cabinet minister presented small silver salver reposed hastily twisted piece paper 
mr hebblethwaite little nod unrolled glanced towards duchess bowed complacently 
smile still upon lips confident light eyes mr hebblethwaite held crumpled piece paper read hurriedly scrawled pencil lines germany declared war russia presented ultimatum france 
messages 
mr hebblethwaite strong man 
man immense self control 
yet moment arteries life seemed though ceased flow 
sat head table eyes never left pencilled words 
mind fought discarded find still hammering brain traced letters scarlet upon distant walls 
war great unbelievable tragedy one thousand one chance life ever taken hand almost fell side 
queer little silence 
one liked ask question one liked speak 
duchess last murmured words silence become intolerable 
bad news whispered 
bad news indeed mr hebblethwaite answered raising voice little every one table might hear 
heard war office germany declared war russia 
perhaps circumstances excuse 
rose feet 
queer singing ears 
feast seemed turned sickly debauch 
pinnacle success seemed fallen away 
faces guests even looked seemed conscience expressing one thing one thing horrible conviction deadening senses 
others could true taken lightly charge care mighty empire dared gamble upon instead providing security thrust thought away natural strength man began reassert 
done ill done people sake 
people must rally
