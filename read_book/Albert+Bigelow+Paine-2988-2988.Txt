humble birthplace florida missouri small village early thirties smaller perhaps though day promise even less celebrity 
west unassembled undigested comparatively unknown 
two states louisiana missouri less half million white persons lay beyond great river 
st louis boasted ten thousand inhabitants river trade south single metropolis vast uncharted region 
telegraph railroads stage lines consequence scarcely maps

particular pride matter 
puny baby wavering promise life 
still john clemens must regarded favor first gift fortune new land named little boy samuel father added name old dear virginia friend langhorne 
family fortunes would seem improving time may regarded arrival another son good omen

beginning long journey robust childhood 
new baby managed go winter matter comment among family neighbors 
added strength came slowly little sam called always delicate early years 
curious childhood full weird fantastic impressions contradictory influences stimulating alike imagination embryo philosophy life begins almost infancy 
john clemens seldom devoted time company children 
looked comfort mental development well could gave advice occasion 
bought book sometimes picture book subscribed peter parley magazine marvel delight older children join amusements rarely never laughed 
mark twain remember ever seen heard father laugh 
problem supplying food somber one john clemens also working perpetual motion machine period absorbed spare time inventor least mirthful occupation 
jane clemens busy 
sense humor die added cares years temper well features became sharper well fairly range busy employments 
little sam companions brothers sisters older orion ten years senior followed pamela margaret intervals two three years benjamin kindly little lad whose gentle life chiefly devoted looking baby brother three years junior 
addition associations still potent influences day section intimate enveloping institution slavery daily companionship slaves 
children time fond negroes confided 
would fact lost without protection company 
jennie house girl uncle ned man work apparently acquired improved prospects real charge children supplied entertainment 
wonderful entertainment 
time visions dreams small 
gossip superstitions 
old tales repeated adornments improvements suggested immediate events 
evening clemens children big little gathered great open fireplace jennie uncle ned told tales hair lifting legends 
even baby two three years could follow drift primitive telling would shiver cling close horror delight curdling thrill 
tales always began pon time one story golden arm smallest listener would one day repeat elaborately wider audiences many lands 
briefly ran follows pon time man wife arm pure gold died buried graveyard one night husband went dug cut golden arm tuck home one night ghost white come wife says w h r r golden arm w h r r golden arm w h r r g l den arm uncle ned repeated blood curdling questions would look first one another listeners eyes bands drawn front breast fingers turned crooked like claws bent question closer shrinking forms 
tone sepulchral awful pause waiting time reply 
culmination came pounce one group shake shoulders shout got tore pieces children would shout lordy look furtively shoulders fearing see woman white black wall instead gloomy shapeless shadows darted across flickering flames fireplace went one brand flared another 
story great ball fire used follow lonely travelers along dark roads woods 
pon time man riding along de road come ha nted house heard de chains rattlin rattlin rattlin ball fire come rollin got stirrup make difference horse galloped went slow stood still de ball fire staid stirrup till got plum de front wife come say gord dat devil fire work witch spell drive away 
big uncle ned oh bout big head spect likely come dis yere chimney time 
certainly atmosphere like meant tropic development imagination delicate child 
games daily talk concerned fanciful semi african conditions strange primal possibilities 
children day believed spells charms bad luck signs learned negro guardians 
negroes chief companions protectors children likewise one discomforts 
greatest real dread children knew fear meeting runaway slaves 
runaway slave regarded worse wild beast treated worse caught 
children saw one brought florida six men took empty cabin threw floor bound ropes 
groans loud frequent 
things made impression would last lifetime 
slave punishment unknown even household 
jennie especially often saucy obstreperous 
jane clemens strength character body undertook punish insolence whereupon jennie snatched whip hand 
john clemens sent haste 
came tied jennie wrists together bridle rein administered chastisement across shoulders cowhide 
things calculated impress sensitive child 
pleasant weather children roamed country hunting berries nuts drinking sugar water tying knots love vine picking petals daisies formula love love always accompanied one sometimes half dozen small darky followers 
shoes taken first april 
time pair old woolen stockings worn soon disappeared leaving feet bare summer 
one dreads possibility sticking rusty nail foot liable cause lockjaw malady regarded awe terror 
knew lockjaw uncle john quarles black man dan subject 
sometimes opened mouth utmost capacity felt joints slip compelled put cornbread jole greens piece possum eating mouth remained fixed abyss doctor came restored natural position exertion muscular power would well nigh lifted ox 
uncle john quarles home farm slaves sources never ending delight 
perhaps farm ordinary missouri farm slaves average negroes children things never apparent 
halo anything belonged uncle john quarles halo jovial hilarious kindness gentle hearted humane man 
visit house child heaven mirth pranks continually 
children came eggs would say hens lay eh tell maw feed em parched corn drive em uphill always splendid stroke humor small hearers 
also knew mimic empty hands peculiar patting tossing pone corn bread placing oven 
would make fearful threats children disobedience never executed 
fishing returned late would say hunt dark make smell like burnt horn nothing could exceed ferocity threat children delightful terror curiosity wondered would happen ever happen would result giving child peculiar savor 
altogether curious early childhood little sam least seems us 
doubtless commonplace enough time locality 
v way fortune perhaps john quarles jocular happy go lucky nature general conduct altogether harmonize john clemens taciturn business methods 
notwithstanding fact builder dreams clemens neat methodical papers always order 
hearty dislike anything resembling frivolity confusion likely chief features john quarles storekeeping 
events dissolved partnership end two three years clemens opened business across street 
also practiced law whenever cases elected justice peace acquiring permanent title judge 
needed one assist store took orion time twelve thirteen years old besides youth orion days visionary studious pensive lad taste commerce 
partnership formed man developed neither capital business ability proved disaster end 
modest tide success come john clemens establishment florida begun wane 
another boy henry born july added one responsibility burdens 
still remained promise better things 
seemed least good prospect scheme making salt river navigable likely become operative 
even small boats bateaux running high lower branch south fork florida would become emporium trade merchants property owners village would reap harvest 
act legislature passed incorporating navigation company judge clemens president 
congress petitioned aid work internal improvement 
confident company success hamlet thrown fever excitement establishment boatyard actual construction bateau democratic congress turned back proposed improvement 
boat bigger skiff ever ascended salt river though wild report evidently hoax party picnickers seen one night ghostly steamer loaded manned puffing stream 
old scotchman hugh robinson heard said doubt word say 
scotland often happens people killed troubled send spirits abroad seen much like reflection looking glass 
ghost wrecked steamboat 
john quarles present laughed ever anybody trouble men steamboat said 
democratic candidates last election 
killed salt river improvements salt river killed 
ghosts went river ghostly steamboat 
possible comment widely repeated traveled far origin term going salt river applied defeated political candidates 
dictionaries give phrase probably traceable small difficult stream kentucky seems reasonable believe originated quarles witty comment 
attempt ever made establish navigation salt river 
rumors railroads already running east put end thought 
railroads could run anywhere probably cheaper easier maintain difficult navigation requiring locks dams 
salt river lost prestige possible water highway became mere scenery 
railroads ruined greater rivers little salt greater villages florida though neither florida salt river touched railroad day 
perhaps close detail early history may thought unnecessary work kind things definite influences career little lad world would one day know mark twain 
vi 
new home death little margaret final misfortune came clemens family florida 
doubtless hastened departure 
superstition days refer health good luck rather ascribe kindness providence bring judgment 
jane clemens one day spoke neighbor good luck thus far lost member family 
day sisters pamela margaret returned school margaret laid books table looked glass flushed cheeks pulled trundle bed lay 
never right mind 
doctor sent diagnosed case bilious fever 
one evening nine clock orion sitting edge trundle bed patient door opened little sam four years old walked bedroom fast asleep 
came side trundle bed pulled bedding near margaret shoulder time woke 
next day little girl picking coverlet known could live 
week later died 
nine years old beautiful child plump form rosy cheeks black hair bright eyes 
august 
little sam first sight death first break clemens family left sad household 
shoemaker lived next door claimed seen several weeks previous vision coffin funeral procession pass gate winding road cemetery exactly happened 
matters going badly enough john clemens 
yet never without one great comforting thought future tennessee land 
underlaid every plan anodyne every ill 
sell tennessee land everything right refrain brought solace darkest hours 
blessing little else brighten days 
negotiations looking sale land usually progress 
pressure became hard finances lowest ebb offered price five cents acre sometimes 
conditions improved however little price suddenly advanced even maximum one thousand dollars acre 
genuine offer came along though eagerly welcomed moment always refused little consideration 
struggle along somehow jane would say 
throw away children fortune 
one believed tennessee land jane clemens favorite cousin james lampton courtliest gentlest prodigal optimist guileless race 
james lampton land always millions everything 
made stupendous fortunes daily new ways 
bare mention tennessee land sent figures ended purchase estates england adjoining durham lamptons always referred kindred casually mentioning whereabouts health present earl 
mark twain merely put james lampton paper created colonel sellers story hawkins family told gilded age reflects clearly struggle days 
words tennessee land golden promise became earliest remembered syllables 
grew detest time came mean mockery 
one offers received trifling sum two hundred fifty dollars moment need even considered 
course scornfully refused 
autobiographical chapters orion clemens left behind said received two hundred fifty dollars would ever made clear expenses whole tennessee land forty years worry three generations 
less speculative logical reasoner would done beginning john clemens selected place though little village river already navigable steamboat town least beginnings manufacturing trade already established say hannibal missouri point well chosen shown prosperity day 
delay matters 
came decision acted quickly 
disposed portion goods shipped remainder overland family chattels loaded wagon ready set new home 
orion records reason father invite get wagon always sensitive slight regarded light deliberate desertion 
sense abandonment caused heart ache 
wagon gone feet discovered invited enter 
wished missed arrived hannibal 
world would seen treated would cried shame incident noted remembered long became curiously confused another mark twain mind 
autobiographical chapter published north american review tells move hannibal relates left behind absentminded family 
incident abandonment happen later somewhat differently 
would indeed absent minded family parents sister brothers ranging fourteen years age drive leaving little sam age four behind 
mentioned prefatory note mark twain memory played many tricks later life 
incidents filtered vivid imagination many bore little relation actual occurrence 
lapses amusing occasionally worked unintentional injustice 
author purpose every instance far possible keep record straight 
vii 
little town hannibal 
hannibal already corporate community atmosphere 
town distinct southern flavor though rather astir true southern community period western planned though without excitement certain new enterprises made show least manufacturing 
somnolent slave town could less wholly asleep say dead tranquilly content 
mark twain remembered white town drowsing sunshine summer morning great mississippi magnificent mississippi rolling mile wide tide along dense forest away side 
little city proud scenery justly circled bluffs holliday hill north lover leap south shining river foreground little desired way setting 
river course great highway 
rafts drifted steamboats passed gave communication outside world st louis metropolis one hundred miles away 
hannibal inclined rank next importance took airs accordingly 
society kinds negroes town drunkards general gaines jimmy finn later old ben blankenship several nondescript grades mechanics tradesmen professional men community wore tall hats ruffled shirt fronts swallow tail coats usually positive color blue snuff brown green 
families constituted true aristocracy southern town 
pleasant homes brick large frame mansions colonnaded entrances manner southern architecture period undoubted greek root certain drawing books said accessible builders days 
also means slaves land yielded income addition professional earnings 
lived style considered fitting rank comforts obtainable 
grade society judge clemens family belonged means longer enabled provide either comforts ostentation class 
settled family belongings portion house hill street pavey hotel merchandise established modestly main street orion new suit clothes clerk 
possibly clothes gave orion renewed ambition mercantile life waned 
business begin actively presently dreaming reading away time 
little later became printer apprentice office hannibal journal father suggestion 
orion clemens perhaps deserves special word 
much associated famous brother many years personality boy man worth least casual consideration 
fifteen developed characteristics greater less degree go life 
kindly loving disposition like clemens children quick temper always contrite forgiving never without fond regard knew best 
weaknesses manifold whole negative kind 
honorable truthful tendency bad habits unworthy pursuits indeed positive traits sort 
chief misfortune 
full whims fancies unstable indeterminate swayed every passing emotion influence 
daily laid new course study achievement fling aside chance remark printed paragraph bit advice ran contrary purpose 
life bound succession extremes alternate periods supreme exaltation despair 
autobiographical chapters already mentioned orion sets every impulse emotion failure faithful humility always respect always approval men 
printing step downward trade orion felt keenly 
gentleman son prospective heir tennessee land entitled profession 
punishment disgrace weighed upon 
remembered benjamin franklin printer eaten apple bunch grapes dinner 
orion decided emulate franklin time took biscuit glass water meal foreseeing day electrify world eloquence 
surprised find clear mind low diet rapidly learned trade 
children pamela twelve benjamin seven put school

queer fanciful uncommunicative child detested indoors would run away watched always direction river 
walked sleep often rest household got middle night find fretting cold dark corner 
doctor summoned oftener good family purse perhaps may credit story heavy dosings stern allopathic days 
yet would appear satisfied heritage ailments ambitious 
epidemic measles black deadly kind ravaging hannibal yearned complaint 
yearned much heard playmate one bowen boys ran away slipping house crept bed infection 
success venture complete 
days later clemens family gathered tearfully around little sam bed see die
