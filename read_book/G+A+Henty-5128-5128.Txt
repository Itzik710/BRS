subject dangerous one council spies everywhere denounced one hostile established state things lost 
know danger young man said passionately 
know hitherto ventured raise voices authority tyrants died torture murmuring stamped blood 
yet danger ten times great speaker risen couch walking tent could keep silent 
tyrants brought us extravagance corruption wasted public funds paralyzed arms 
sicily sardinia lost allies africa goaded exactions rebellion carthage lately obliged fight hard existence 
lower classes city utterly disaffected earnings wrung tax gatherers

democracy great mass people whose vote necessary ratify law passed senate 
time however authority passed suffetes general body senate democracy hands committee senate one hundred number called council real power invested hands inner council consisting twenty thirty members

judges hundred number 
appointed council ever ready carry behest consequently justice carthage mockery

case horses readiness among trees close hand lions take plains must mount join numidians chase 
would rather meet foot father 
yes excitement danger malchus tell attack wounded lion joke even party twenty five well armed men 
force fury prodigious throw fearlessly upon clump spears order reach enemies 
one blow paws certain death 
careful therefore malchus 
stir side remember vast difference rashness bravery 
chapter ii night attack time seemed malchus pass slowly indeed sat waiting commencement hunt 
deep roars sounding like distant thunder heard time time among hills 
twice malchus fancied could hear sounds would made heavy stone dislodged site leaping mountain side sure fancy sound might caused roaring lions far away among hills 
father said three hours would probably elapse circuit would completed 
distance great troops would make way greatest care along rocky hills brushwood forest advance would slow take pains move noiselessly

lions likely discover gaps line far much terrified uproar sudden blaze light approach troops 
hark roaring truly majestic terrible sound wonder wild natives mountains regard animals something respect pay gods 
keep sharp eye along foot hills 
saying soon beasts may break cover 
slowly semicircle light seen contract soldiers formed moved forward towards foot hill although malchus kept eyes strained upon fringe trees foot could see signs movement 
roaring still continued intervals evident beasts inclosed arc descended lower slopes hill 
may upon us sooner expect malchus 
color well nigh matches sand may see close upon us 
presently nubian soldier standing behind malchus touched shoulder said whisper pointing time across plain 
malchus could time see nothing made indistinct forms 
six general said making grove

malchus could clearly see lions approaching 
advancing slowly turning occasionally look back reluctant quit shelter hills malchus could hardly resist start uneasiness one suddenly gave vent deep threatening roar menacing terrible leaves trees seemed quiver light moon vibrations

four days journey carthagena took party heart mountains sheltered valley ran stream formed camp 
good sport 
sometimes dogs tracked bears lair sometimes soldiers made wide sweep hills inclosed considerable tract forest moved forward shouting clashing arms drove animals inclosed valley malchus companions taken post 
various game fell arrows javelins 
sometimes herd deer would dart past two bears family would come along growling fiercely went looking back angrily disturbers peace 
sometimes pack wolves red tongues hanging fierce snarling barks would hurry along wild boar would trot leisurely past reached spot hunters posted

sometimes portions animals killed hung night bough tree distance camp attract bears one two party taking post neighbouring trees would watch night coming beasts 
snow lying thick tops mountains wolves plentiful among forests 
one day malchus two companions followed wounded deer far among hills miles away camp darkness began set 
think better give malchus said shall find difficult find way back idea late 
companions agreed turned faces towards camp 
another half hour perfectly dark shadow trees moon shining position afforded means judging direction camp lay 
even assistance easy matter making way

eating meal chatting time halcon companions lay rest malchus volunteering keep first watch 
time sat quietly occasionally throwing logs fire store collected readiness 
presently attitude changed listened intently rose feet 
several times heard howls wolves wandering woods made long deep continuous howling listened minute two aroused companions 
large pack wolves approaching said direction sound judge hunting traces footsteps

yes sound must large pack halcon agreed pile fire set gather wood quickly possible beasts large packs formidable foes 
three men set work vigourously cutting brushwood lopping small boughs trees swords 
divide fire four halcon said pile fuel center hardly dare pass fires 
pack descending slope keeping chorus howls short yelps sent shiver uneasiness malchus 
wolves approached spot howling suddenly ceased 
see us halcon said keep sharp lookout throw away shot shall need arrows daylight 
standing perfectly quiet friends could hear pattering sound made wolves feet upon fallen leaves moon sunk unable make figures 
seems malchus said whisper see specks fire gleaming bushes 
reflection fire eyes halcon replied 
see round us must scores 
time wolves approached closer encouraged silence little group standing center fire two three gray forms showed circle light 
three bows twanged 
two wolves fell third howl pain fled darkness 
sound snarling growling cry pain fierce struggle long continued snarling 
malchus asked shudder 
believe eating wounded comrade halcon replied 
heard custom savage brutes 
see carcasses two disappeared already 
short time elapsed since fallen wolves stolen dragged away bodies two killed 
incident showed extreme hunger wolves noiseless motions redoubled vigilance party 
malchus threw handful brushwood fires 
must careful fuel halcon said 
would thought lay sleep 
collected fuel enough fires safe doubt much supply last till morning 
hours went attitude wolves became threatening strong bodies advanced close fires 
every time armfuls fuel thrown flames leaped brightly time fell back losing several numbers arrows little party 
pile fuel sinking fast except wolves advanced necessary let fires burn 
must want four hours yet daylight halcon said threw last piece wood 
look round fire blazes see make tree may climbed 
would taken first instead trusting fires 
unfortunately chosen somewhat open space ground encampment brushwood grew thick among trees 
tree malchus said pointing bough six feet ground

well halcon assented attempt fire burns low 
put swords sheaths sling bows arrows behind take burning brand 
better weapons case swords spears 
ready waving burning brands heads three carthaginians dashed across intervening space towards tree

one wolf sprang upon shield nearly brought ground sharp boss pierced body flung moment dashed brand full face another 
third sprang upon shoulder felt hot breath face 
dropping brand drove dagger deep side 
hurled heavy shield among mass wolves took bound midst grasping bough swung tree sat legs drawn score wolves leaped towards open mouths 
gave cry horror 
two friends confused mass struggling bodies alone showed fallen 
instant hesitated debating whether leap strive rescue glance showed would pulled long could reach spot fallen 
shifting along arm reached trunk rose feet sent arrows vengefully midst struggling mass wolves three four shafts left 
reserved last resource

malchus climbed tree reached fork could sit ease waited morning hoped foes would disappear 
gray light dawned saw still watch dawn brightened day show signs moving 
saw intention leaving place malchus began consider seriously best 
might still aught knew miles away camp friends would means knowing position placed 
would doubt send soldiers search party broken wilderness forest mountain merest chance whether would find spot prisoner 
still appeared possibility rescue 
trees grew thickly together could easily climbed stationed next might made way distance wolves watching could see well night day advantage shifting position 
day passed slowly 
wolves part withdrawn beneath tree kept station steadily malchus knew rest lying beneath bushes round could hear frequent snarling sometimes gray head thrust pair eager eyes looked hungrily towards 
time time malchus listened breathlessly hopes hearing distant shouts comrades still forest felt sure wolves would hear anyone approaching 
twice indeed fancied pricked ears attitude attention could hear sounds inaudible alarm soon passed away might listening distant footsteps stag passing forest 
night came long dreary hours 
malchus strapped belt tree prevent falling managed obtain hours uneasy sleep waking time start cold perspiration fear believing falling hungry jaws

wolves seeing prey close hand thronged thickly strove leap

several killed way rest rendered cautious withdrew short distance 
suddenly idea struck malchus 
took belt formed running noose waited wolves summon courage attack 
long 
furious hunger prey already devoured sufficient whet wolves approached began spring towards bough 
malchus dropped noose one necks effort hauled bough despatched dagger 
moved along bough hung branch ten feet ground slashing open dagger chest stomach

six wolves one hauled despatched malchus expected smell blood rendered pack savage ever 
assembled round foot tree continued spring trunk making vain endeavors get supply food hung tantalizingly short distance beyond reach 
day passed without signs rescue 
became dark malchus descended lowest trunk fired three remaining arrows among wolves 
loud howls followed discharge followed desperate struggle 
tumbled position six dead wolves ground noiselessly possible made way along bough adjoining tree another till attained distance spot wolves fighting growling remains companions far absorbed work thought 
dropped noiselessly ground fled top speed 
would sure time wolves completed feast even discover missing tree would probably time could hit upon scent especially feasted blood sense smell would time dulled 
previsions accurate 
several times stopped listened dread lest hear distant howl would tell pack scent 
quiet save usual cries noises forest 
two hours saw distant glow light soon encampment friends 
malchus comrades exclaimed entered tent two days splashed blood 
halcon chalcus dead malchus said devoured wolves 
cry horror broke three young guardsmen 
tis true malchus went give food wine 
neither eaten drunk last two days gone terrible time 
even seem see round countless cruel eyes hungry open mouths red tongues 
seeing malchus utterly worn exhausted companions hastened place food drink asking questions 
malchus drank cup wine took mouthful bread faint exhausted present eat 
supported well terrible strain last forty eight hours run forest noticed told upon safe among friends felt weak child 
time lay upon lion skin thrown upon entering tent unable reply comrades questions 
cordial began take effect roused forced eat 
told friends happened 
indeed escape malchus take trees think malchus said suppose others 
halcon leader told us 
thought fires would keep 
could thought beasts would ventured attack us always heard terrible one others said thought three armed men would match number 
would much thirty could done withstand malchus replied seem care lives sought slay 
hundreds hundreds 
would rather march alone assault walled city face terrible beasts 
morning whole party started scene encounter 
malchus difficulty discovering last searching long time came upon 
ground beneath tree everywhere trampled torn wolves struggles spotted patches dry blood 
helmets shields arms halcon chalcus lay remnant bones remained fragments skin closely gnawed skulls alone testified wolves fallen encounter 
arms gathered party returned camp next day started carthagena experience none cared hunting 
weeks malchus completely recovered effects strain undergone 
nights disturbed restless 
would constantly start couch thinking heard howl wolves sudden noise made start turn pale 
seeing shaken young kinsmen passed hannibal sent several times ships going across africa stores 
venture send carthage although influence commissioners sufficient annul order council sending malchus prisoner probable return would seized put death supposed crime committed gratify hatred hanno adherents 
sea voyages soon restored malchus accustomed health 
trained disciplined body constant exercise nerves easily shaken soon recovered tone early march rejoined regiment able enter zest energy preparations hannibal making siege saguntum 
difficult operation would preparations made appeared enormous 
every week ships brought reinforcements troops iberian contingents largely increased 
one day malchus entered apartment father hannibal talking earnestly together large map spread 
would retired hannibal called 
come malchus would secrets 
although young know devoted carthage brave determined 
see age nine years ago may day destined continue work beginning 
commenced early training severe 
father son cousin promotion naturally rapid 
therefore tell plans 
clear rome carthage exist one must destroyed 
useless strike extremities blow must dealt heart 
unfortunately fleet longer superior rome victories sea however important temporarily cripple enemy 
land blow must struck 
sea say land troops southern italy continue pour reinforcements fighting men north africa gates rome 
without absolute command sea done 
therefore intend make spain base march southern gaul alps italy fight romans ground 
already agents work among gauls northern tribes italy trust join war common enemy 
enterprise great one impossible succeeds rome destroyed carthage reign without rival mistress world 
plan hasdrubal fallen carry 
grand plan indeed malchus exclaimed enthusiastically glorious plan difficulties seem tremendous 
difficulties made overcome brave men hannibal said 
alps greatest barrier agents tell difficulties insuperable even elephants 
start spain subdue 
saguntum protection rome must crushed country north ebro conquered pacified 
done passage reinforcements army italy easy 
gauls favor us mountains tribes crushed bought route advance reinforcements retreat hardly pressed always open 
alone 
plans must yet known 
already enemies carthage gaining strength 
many adherents put death estates others confiscated capture saguntum restore supremacy enthusiasm incite among populace carry 
spoils taken sufficient silence every murmur carthage 
leave us malchus much talk arrange given plenty think present 
chapter viii plot frustrated leaving hannibal malchus rejoin comrades mounted hills behind town sat looking sea thinking vast plan hannibal words laid father alluded presence 
malchus brought hamilcar regard rome deadly enemy carthage till seen truth hannibal grasped struggle empire two republics one life death carthage rome could coexist one must absolutely destroyed 
indeed creed barcine party apart minor questions internal reforms great point differed hanno trading portion community chief supporters 
favor carthage abandoning colonies conquests devoting solely commerce acquisition wealth 
believing rome would open europe asia conquer would grudge carthage northern seaboard africa forgot nation rich defenceless speedily fall victim greed powerful warlike neighbor conqueror never needs excuses attack upon defenceless neighbor 
hitherto malchus thought war rome made sea fights descents upon sicily sardinia 
idea invading italy striking rome never even entered mind words father forgotten events followed quickly upon 
prospect words opened seemed immense 
first northern spain conquered gaul crossed terrible mountains heard travellers next surmounted finally fight life death fought plains italy 
struggle would indeed tremendous one malchus felt heart beat fast thought actor 
surely history world told greater enterprise 
even first step taken mere preliminary grand expedition formidable one 
saguntum stood outpost rome 
carthage advancing south rome pressing forward east along shores mediterranean planted firmly marseilles port gave foothold gaul formed base whence could act spain 
order check rising power carthaginians entered firm alliance saguntines whose country occupied district valencia 
terms last treaty two republics forbidden make war upon tribes alliance rivals saguntum thus jurisdiction rome attack upon would almost equivalent declaration war 
position city one great strength 
stood almost isolated rock foot spur mountains formed amphitheatre behind 
around extended rich fertile country sea less mile walls romans could thus quickly send succor allies 
rock town stood well nigh inaccessible falling sheer foot walls assailable western side rocks sloped gradually plain 
walls extremely strong lofty strengthened great tower dominated whole slope 
would difficult form approaches rock bare soil afforded cover kind 
hitherto carthaginian generals scrupulously respected territory saguntines rest spain subdued necessary reduce advanced post rome open door rome mistress sea could moment pour legions heart spain 
saguntines ignorant danger threatened 
sent urgently rome demand legion stationed protection 
rome hesitated despatching legion troops distant spot case naval reverse would isolated cut 
hannibal far look excuse attack upon saguntum 
previous year engaged campaign carpatans saguntines taking advantage critical position made war upon town torbola ally carthage 
torbola implored assistance hannibal preparing march saguntum whole force without waiting arrival spring 
preparations silently made 
saguntines although uneasy idea imminent danger carthaginian army collected around carthagena entire ignorance called upon take field 
say malchus hannibal asked evening 
time gave command 
near relative fitting authority 
served campaign eligible command may give 
shown prompt danger worthy command men 
would rather place company giant gauls steady iberians well disciplined libyans active tribesmen desert choose shall 
malchus thought time 
day battle said last would rather lead gauls march told meditating would rather company numidian footmen act scouts feel way army 
would perhaps much glory obtained would constant work excitement far better marching long column army 
think choice good one hannibal replied 
corps needed feel way advance examine roads indicate column best move guard ambushes surprises 
tomorrow inspect numidian footmen put exercises 
foot races trials skill bow bid officers pick two hundred active vigourous among shall command 
choose among comrades guards one would like lieutenant 
take trebon malchus said fought side side last campaign 
prompt active always cheerful fatigue brave lion 
could wish better comrade 
hannibal replied henceforth captain advanced company army 
remember malchus responsibility great one henceforward must boyish tricks 
company eyes army upon vigilance safety start upon expedition slight degree depend 
remember conduct justify choosing young kinsman important post 
next day numidians put exercises nightfall two hundred picked men chosen ranks placed hannibal command malchus 
trebon greatly pleased found appointed lieutenant company 
although noble family connections much less influential majority comrades deemed exceptionally fortunate permitted enter chosen corps carthaginian cavalry expected made officer years come since promotion carthaginian army almost wholly matter family influence 
indeed obliged malchus said joined friend hannibal announced appointment 
general told appointed request 
never even hoped good fortune would befall 
course knew would speedily obtain command people influence whatever 
general says company act scouts army plenty opportunity distinguish 
unfortunately see much chance fighting present 
iberian tribesmen lesson last autumn likely long time give us trouble 
make uneasy score trebon malchus said tell let go ere long fighting enough satisfy even pugnacious 
one evening malchus left club early 
full thoughts tremendous struggle soon begin great antagonists wearied light talk gay comrades 
games chance room club allotted afforded pleasure interest wagering going merits horses run races following day 
leaving club directed footsteps towards top hill carthagena stood sitting alone one highest points looked sea sparkling moonlight many vessels harbor lagoons stretching inland side city 
tried imagine course army follow terrible journey snow covered passes tremendous range mountains heard descent plains italy first sight rome 
pictured battles would fought way deadly conflict would take place rome could carried assault great rival carthage humbled dust 
pictured return triumphant expedition shouting multitudes would acclaim hannibal sole arbitrator destinies carthage heart rejoiced changes would take place overthrow faction hanno reform abuses commencement era justice freedom prosperity 
three hours sat thus awoke fact night cold hour late 
drawing bernous tightly round descended city part wrapped sleep 
passing native quarter door opened several men came 
scarcely knowing malchus drew back doorway moved ahead followed little distance 
time would thought nothing incident nerves highly strung moment pause dictated indisposition encounter anything might disturb current thoughts motive

malchus reached chamber sat time deep thought 
clear something wrong 
secret meeting two carthaginians natives one employed hannibal household could mean good 
money passed judging size apparent weight bag inconsiderable amount 
could mean months hasdrubal fallen beneath dagger native servant 
could plot life hannibal two carthaginians connected hanno might well agents employed rid great rival 
yet heard nothing would justify bringing grave accusation men 
money seen exchanged might price horse slave might make ridiculous speak hannibal father occurred 
decided therefore action might take must account 
words overheard meant anything plot really hand carried following night 
malchus determined take steps meet 
next day took trebon counsels told mysterious meetings accidentally discovered 
free access hannibal palace officers constantly coming soldiers arriving leaving messages orders 
malchus therefore difficulty passing apartment one one ten picked men company 
orders remain perfectly quiet trebon also took post malchus telling make excuse prevent attendant slave entering apartment absent 
concert evening palace crowded guests 
time time malchus stole away room numidians seated ground silent immovable many bronze statues 
times kept near hannibal watching closely movements every native passed near ready spring forward instantly saw signs evil intention 
however much apprehend even suspicions correct plot foot hannibal attempt would made assassinate midst crowded assembly would possibility escape perpetrators deed 
last guests began depart hour later quiet palace 
laying aside sandals malchus stole noiselessly marble pavements approached entrance twice seen opened late 
slave lying close 
unobserved malchus stole away chamber bade numidians follow 
noiselessly troop barefooted arabs moved shadowlike lofty halls corridors 
two placed entrance chamber hannibal slept orders allow one pass returned others proceeded entrance 
lights burning passages close hand slave perceived approaching figures 
leaped feet could cry malchus stepped forward said silence value life 
know malchus son hamilcar 
tell truth tomorrow torture shall wring 
placed carpadon one chief attendants ordered remain admit return 
knew harm slave said 
first time kept watch purpose lord six seven times gone late 
know cause absence lord would become slave question one chief attendants lord hannibal goes comes 
man manner natural surprise interest one rank malchus showed doings attendant genuine malchus convinced knew nothing enterprise man placed might engaged 
well said believe tell 
resume place door open usual signal 
say word make sign may lead know presence 
mind eye upon life pay treachery 
malchus four men took post one side door standing well back shadow presence would noticed anyone entering 
trebon remaining four men took similar position side doorway 
two hours passed 
length low tap followed two others heard door 
slave opened 
carpadon entered sudden movement threw one arm round slave neck stabbed heart 
opened door wide said low tone enter safe 
moment dark mass men poured door 
matter serious malchus expected 
looked entry perhaps three four men intended close behind cut score least many might outside knew 
therefore gave signal shouting carthage followers fell upon one flank natives dress showed trebon attacked 
shout surprise alarm unexpected onslaught several cut 
others drawing swords began defend trying time retreat door however many others still pressing 
minutes severe fight went numbers desperation carpadon followers began tell spite efforts malchus numidians would forced fall back allow others pass help hand 
shouting clashing weapons awakened palace officer guard ten men bearing torches came running full speed post chief entrance 
guard came stood gazing uncertain among conflict raging malchus moment drew fray 
seize disarm natives said numidians orders 
instant soldiers understood situation fell natives whose retreat cut numidians speedily disarmed nearer door instant saw torches approaching taken flight 
moment later hannibal hamilcar many officers resident palace came running 
means fray malchus means attempt upon life hannibal fortunate enough discover defeat 
men hamilcar asked 
far know natives malchus replied 
chief party man lies bleeding one attendants 
one soldiers held torch close man face 
carpadon hannibal said 
believed honest faithful 
tool others hannibal well paid night work 
hannibal gave orders prisoners strictly guarded hamilcar malchus returned private study 
lamps lighted attendants withdrew 
malchus tell us story hannibal said 
seems strange said nought father learned left us take measures might seem fit us instead taking matter hands 
certainties go upon assuredly done see tell learned nothing suspicions vaguest aught knew might altogether wrong 
malchus gave full details manner suspicions first excited previous night taken steps ascertain whether foundation 
see concluded sort certainty nothing prove money paid purchase horse slave 
one fact one party servant rendered discovered serious 
fate hasdrubal never given matter second thought knowing assassinated trusted servant seeing two men whose families knew belonged hanno faction engaged secret talk one attendants suspicion struck similar deed might attempted 
words go upon tomorrow night without fail 
enough bring accusation two men noble family told tale without confirmation received would probably treated lightly 
resolved therefore wait see taking precaution harm could come secrecy 
concealed room ten numidians lieutenant trebon ample force whatever might betide 
suspected man intended two three others steal chamber slay slept could stopped attempt come larger force could proved resist guard arrived spot 
hand night passed quietly suspicions proved altogether erroneous escape ridicule would certainly forthcoming alarmed without cause 
acted wisely well son hamilcar said carthage owes life beloved hannibal 
indeed reasoned great wisdom forethought 
informed us discovered taken precautions would doubtless effected object would probably become known plotters attempt would postponed attempted time perhaps success 
say hannibal reason proud young son mine indeed hamilcar deeply indebted 
life care although precious sake beloved imilce fallen plans thought together would frustrated fairest chance carthage ever fighting quarrel rival would destroyed 
truly marvellous escape seems gods must inspired malchus act slight grounds seeing two carthaginians guard company three four natives late hour evening 
think best traitors plotted life hannibal shall try execute send carthage dealt hannibal answer minute 
think hamilcar best plan keep silent altogether danger run 
army would furious would time dispirited known carthage two nobles executed attempt life 
would cause fresh outbreak animosity even deadlier feud hanno friends 
therefore say let men taken tonight executed morning without question asked let word said us bribed carthaginians 
palace know party natives broken guess life object need know 
two men call tomorrow none present let know aware authors attempt bid resign places guard return carthage 
grieves go unpunished hamilcar said doubtless plan wisest 
hannibal said rising bed 
malchus acquaint trebon determination silence kept tell shall bear mind forget share night work 
malchus henceforth cousin saved life shall never forget 
shall tell imilce morning danger passed sure come ears know better thank 
accordingly morning hannibal orders carried twelve natives taken prisoners beheaded without usual tortures would inflicted upon similar occasion 
less fourteen others killed fight 
two carthaginian nobles sent hannibal 
came prepared die knew already rumor attempt failed doubted summons reached carpadon denounced accomplices 
went certain doom courage class pale perhaps otherwise unmoved 
hannibal alone hamilcar entered 
assassination altogether unknown crime carthage said quietly well aware think nobles carthaginian horse would stoop 
know provided gold payment men made attempt upon life personally paid attendant carpadon hire assassins lead chamber 
denounce soldiers would tear pieces 
name families would held accursed honest men carthage time 
ask whether given cause offence know done acted simply benefit hanno 
whether instructed deign ask

tale infamy known four persons none others ever know 
proud honor nobles carthage would scum people bandy name families lips guilty foul act treason

make pretext illness private affairs 
tomorrow sail carthage strive efforts good country efface remembrance blow would struck 
saying wave hand dismissed 
went without word astonished clemency humiliated disgrace even utter word thanks 
fairly beyond palace looked men awakened dream 
man one exclaimed 
wonder soldiers adore given us lives saved names disgrace 
henceforth pontus least never take part 
almost much bear said feel would rather ordered us instant execution 
ay sakes pontus others

would shrink back horror done whispered truly family would prefer death worst torture life 
excitement army intense became known body iberians attempted break hannibal palace design murdering many soldiers seizing arms hurried towards city officer ridden news hannibal would assuredly fallen upon native inhabitants general massacre would taken place 
hannibal mounted rode meet soldiers 
received enthusiastic acclamations length raised arm restore silence addressed troops telling deeply valued evidence affection prayed return camps lay arms 
must said confound innocent guilty 
concerned attempt paid penalty lives handful spaniards plotted swear hatred whole race punish innocent guilty would arouse fury iberians throughout whole peninsula work would done 
know things desire friendship goodwill natives 
nothing would grieve attaining efforts marred quarrel people 
pray therefore personal favor abstain tumult go quietly back camp 
attack upon palace made thirty forty scum inhabitants attempt defeated wisdom courage young cousin malchus must henceforth regard savior life 
soldiers acceded request general another outburst cheering returned quietly camp 
result affair render malchus one popular personages army lad quite abashed enthusiastic reception soldiers gave passed among 
removed feeling jealousy might existed among former comrades carthaginian horse although considered matter course carthage generals appoint near relatives posts high command human nature men possessed high patronage could help grumbling little promotion fortunate 
henceforth however voice ever raised promotion malchus appointed command importance none would deemed favor undeserved youth saved life hannibal

upon refusal solemnly declared war hurling javelin walls 
troops advanced assault poured flights arrows masses stones machines javelins missiles descriptions city defenders replying equal vigor walls 
end first day fighting hannibal perceived hopes carrying place assault vain walls high scaled thick shaken irregular attack long siege must undertaken 
great disappointment would cause long delay would scarce possible commence march meditated summer 
advancing saguntum rear thought romans would able land armies cut communication carthagena carthage 
nothing done undertake siege regular order

many riderless horses plain came hearing sound roman trumpets rejoined troop 
malchus placed one 
wounded romans able ride mounted others small party left behind look unable move troops started way 
unable however proceed far horses traveling since morning completely exhausted therefore proceeding miles troop halted 
strong guards posted men lay horses ready mount moment notice possible hannibal might sent large body horsemen pursuit

hour later nessus crept cautiously forward among bushes making considerable detour reached spot whence could command view roman camp 
gone soul remained behind distance across plain could see heavy column marching north 
rose feet returned spot left malchus told romans gone 
first thing nessus get rid chains 
easy chains nessus said rings around legs must remain rejoin camp need file free 
soil sandy nessus could find stone sufficiently large purpose 
therefore started direction romans taken two hours slow walking came upon bed stream boulders sufficiently large purpose 
rings pushed ankles nessus wound round strips cloth formed pad iron skin lessen jar blow placed link chain near leg upon edge boulder drawing sharp heavy sword struck force upon iron 
deep notch made repeated blow link cut difficulty forced two ends apart shackle ring would pass

sometimes groans cries heard rise near would hurry spot knew spies law ever watch suspected entering communication prisoners would sufficient ensure condemnation death

watch extremely strict gates opened nine clock 
escape would discovered impossible pass undetected 
must find hiding place lie concealed search vigilance sentries relaxed easy matter 
let us speak dangerous breathe much less speak 
another word spoken hours 
malchus could hear low continuous scraping noise nessus dagger worked away upon stone grating fitted 
last nessus spoke 
nearly finished lord greater part grating loose half hour complete work 
daylight soon breaking must go

spies hanno everywhere men fear within walls even whisper think 
rate secure hiding place could found decided upon 
nessus reservoirs 
four water skins planks prepared raft 
two friends waiting us one entrances 
fitted raft together readiness 
likely search 
idea excellent nessus 
reservoirs carthage enormous extent remain day wonder admiration travellers 
subterranean cut solid rock stone extracted used walls buildings city 
pillars left intervals support roof calculated underground lakes less contained sufficient water supply wants great city least six months 
vast storing places water absolute necessity climate like northern africa rain falls seldom

iron gates guarded entrance 
nessus friends evening unfastened one gates 
lock old little used gate placed rather prevent children others going water purpose arabs found little difficulty picking rough lock 
malchus followed nessus steps reached edge water fifty feet surface 
stood two arabs bearing torches

across bullock hide stretched forming platform 
rugs skin wine pile flat cakes fruit together half dozen torches 
thanks friends malchus said arabs

paddle lord nessus said 
propose paddle straight away far see torch burning fasten raft pillar 
every night come provisions show light 
see light burn steadily safe approach come bring food news see torch wave fro warning intend search reservoirs

would gladly go share solitude must remain outside plan way escape 
short farewell faithful follower malchus took place raft lit torch fastened upright upon 
paddled slowly away keeping lines heavy columns

time felt sure must approaching boundary reservoir 
therefore moored raft pillar waved torch backwards forwards

malchus extinguished torch placed means relighting nessus furnished close hand wrapping rug lay sleep 
awoke day 
light streaming water opening two three hundred yards away far distance could see faint light marked place steps embarked 
neighborhood opening columns stood clear gray dark background

sometimes faint rustling whisper echo sound citadel passed among columns plaintive squeak bat heard numbers creatures flitting noiselessly darkness forms visible instant passed repassed malchus light 
wondered vaguely could find eat remembered heard nightfall numbers bats could seen flying openings reservoirs seek food without returning hiding places morning approached 
malchus amused thinking fury astonishment hanno colleagues hearing prisoner disappeared pictured hot search doubt going throughout citadel 
thought improbable extreme search would made reservoir 
nessus would refasten gate passing idea could floating subterranean lake could hardly occur 
turned mind various devices might possible get beyond walls citadel 
anxiety hanno acting prevent manner kidnapped sentenced death messenger kinsman hannibal becoming known city would great extraordinary vigilance would used prevent leaving citadel 
guards walls would greatly increased none would allowed pass gate without rigourous examination every nook corner citadel temples barracks storehouses stables would searched 
even search made reservoir malchus little fear discovery even boat come towards spot lying would pass raft round opposite side great pillar twelve feet square lying 
light faded lay sleep 
slept soundly however great heat air subterranean chambers always fresh cool could well bear rugs nessus provided 
next day passed slowly less think

malchus placed clothes upon threw shoulders bernous nessus brought

malchus escaped citadel without possibility suspicion arising issued gates arab garb could traverse streets unsuspected 
nessus overjoyed success stratagem malchus could hardly believe escaped terrible danger threatened 
nessus arab returned citadel

man behind us honest go straight spy hesitate stop corner decide us shall follow shall know 
accordingly next crossroad came nessus turned concealed paces away malchus without pausing walked straight 
minute later nessus saw dark figure come stealthily along 
stopped junction roads stood seconds hesitation followed malchus 
nessus issued hiding place steps silent stealthy tiger tracking prey followed man 
within paces gave sudden spring flung upon burying knife shoulders 
without sound man fell forward face 
nessus coolly wiped knife upon garments spy proceeded rapid pace overtook malchus 
spy said carry tales hanno 
two days later nessus return visit manon brought news latter arranged captain ship owned friend carry across corinth whence would difficulty taking passage italy 
go board late following night ship would set sail daybreak 
next evening malchus accompanied nessus paid farewell visit manon repeated instructions hannibal manon handed letter general assured would friends set work pave way appeal populace first favourable opportunity 
bidding farewell old noble malchus returned house arab prepared departure 
already handsomely rewarded two men mahout services rendered 
course day provided garments trader character assume 
midnight quiet nessus set made way port little frequented landing stage boat awaiting rowed ship lying anchor half mile shore readiness early start morning 
although seemed next impossible could traced malchus walked deck restlessly morning listening every sound anchor weighed sails hoisted vessel began draw away carthage went cabin 
sixth day leaving carthage ship entered port corinth 
several vessels italian ports proceeding arrange passage malchus went shop bought nessus clothing arms would enable pass without difficulty fighting men belonging one latin tribes 
made inquiries quay finding small italian craft start afternoon brundusium went board accosted captain 
want cross italy said reasons wishing land brundusium would fain put ashore distance town 
ready course pay extra trouble 
request seem strange captain 
malchus spoken greek language traded mediterranean familiar 
supposed way embroiled authorities brundusium fled awhile matter blew anxious return homes without passing town 
asked rather high price putting ashore boat wished malchus haggled sum considerable time readiness pay exorbitant price might given rise doubts captain mind quality passengers 
twice made would go ashore captain last abated demands reasonable sum 
settled malchus went ashore remained board vessel sailed feared might recognized sailors carthaginian vessels port 
weather fair wind light second day sailing vessel lay bay miles brundusium 
boat lowered malchus companions set shore 
embarking laid store provisions voyage journey across country slight knowledge malchus latin tongue would betrayed obliged enter town village purchase food 
carrying provisions bundles made mountains three days journey reached without interruption adventure camp hannibal 
still lying intrenched camp near geronium 
roman army watching short distance 
malchus sought tent general whose surprise seeing enter great expected would return spring 
malchus gave account taken place since left 
hannibal indignant extreme hanno ventured arrest condemn ambassador 
learned result interview manon heard completely hostile faction masters carthage agreed counsels old nobleman wise malchus could done good whereas would exposed almost certain death endeavoring carry mission charged 
manon knows best doubt premature attempt excite populace force hanno sending reinforcements much need would failed would injured cause 
friends doubtless work quietly prepare public mind trust ere long decisive victory give opportunity exciting great demonstration behalf 
remainder winter passed quietly 
malchus resumed post commander hannibal bodyguard duties light 
greater part time spent accompanying hannibal visits camps soldiers nothing left undone could add comfort contentment troops 
stronger evidence popularity hannibal influence exercised troops fact army composed men many nationalities part originally compelled enter service carthage maintained discipline unshaken hardships sacrifices campaigns long periods enforced idleness winter quarters 
first last long war neither grumbling discontent insubordination among troops 
served willingly cheerfully 
absolute confidence general willing undertake tremendous labors engage arduous conflicts please knowing part unwearied promoting comfort well times 
spring advanced great magazines hannibal brought became nearly exhausted provisions could obtained surrounding country completely ruined long presence two armies 
became therefore necessary move position occupied winter 
romans possessed great advantage magazines rear constantly replenished allies move might sure obtaining subsistence without difficulty 
thus upon march unembarrassed necessity taking great baggage train halted general could keep army together readiness strike blow whenever opportunity offered hannibal hand forced scatter considerable portion army search provisions 
annual elections rome taken place terentius varro emilius paulus chosen consuls 
emilius belonged aristocratic party given proof military ability three years commanded consul illyrian war 
varro belonged popular party described historians period coarse brutal demagogue son butcher butcher 
unquestionably able man possessed great qualities 
praetor marcellus slain gaulish king hand last gaulish war ostia legion 
destined command fleet guard southern coasts italy another praetor lucius postumius one legion cisalpine gaul keeping tribes friendly carthage 
new consuls arrived take command army hannibal moved geronium 
great roman magazine apulia cannae town near river aulidus 
important place fifty miles shortest route across plain geronium romans unable follow directly across plain time carthaginians greatly outnumbered cavalry would therefore take road round foot mountains nearly seventy miles long yet unaccountable blunder neglected place sufficient guard great magazines cannae defend even days sudden attack 
hannibal saw opportunity spring passing summer broke camp marched straight cannae vast magazines romans fell hands 
thus obtained possession enemy supplies interposed romans low lying district southern apulia alone early season year corn fully ripe 
romans choice advance fight battle recovery magazines retired apulians already suffered terribly war would sheer despair forced declare carthage would extremely difficult continue longer waiting tactics fabius would obliged draw provisions distance hannibal could victual army country behind 
senate therefore largely reinforced army ordered consuls advance give battle 
eight full legions eighty thousand infantry seven thousand two hundred cavalry 
oppose hannibal forty thousand infantry ten thousand excellent cavalry two thousand numidians 
second day leaving neighborhood geronium romans encamped distance six miles carthaginians 
usual difference opinion arose roman consuls commanded army alternate days 
varro wished march enemy without delay emilius adverse risking engagement country level open favourable action hannibal superior cavalry 
following day varro whose turn command marched towards hostile camp 
hannibal attacked roman advanced guard cavalry light infantry varro supported cavalry light troops strong body heavy armed infantry engagement lasted several hours repulsed carthaginians considerable loss 
evening roman army encamped three miles cannae right bank aufidus 
next morning emilius command detached third force across river encamped purpose supporting roman foraging parties side interrupting carthaginians 
next day passed quietly following morning hannibal quitted camp formed army order battle tempt romans attack emilius sensible ground would move contented strengthening camps 
hannibal seeing romans would fight detached numidian cavalry across river cut roman foraging parties surround harass smaller camp side river 
following morning hannibal knowing varro would command feeling sure impetuous disposition consul would burning avenge insult offered surrounding camp numidians moved army across river formed order battle leaving eight thousand men guard camp 
thus obtained position could better hold inferior forces romans deeming intended attack camp side river would likely move whole army across give battle 
fact varro proceeded 
leaving ten thousand men camp orders march attack hannibal engagement led rest troops river united force camp right bank marched river faced position hannibal taken 
skillfully chosen 
river whose general course east west made loop across hannibal drawn army wings resting upon river 
thus romans could outflank effect vastly superior numbers infantry would extent neutralized 
following disposition troops 
spaniards gauls occupied center line infantry 
africans formed two wings 
left flank africans river placed heavy african gaulish horse eight thousand strong two thousand numidians posted infantry river right flank 
hannibal commanded center army person hanno right wing hasdrubal left wing maharbal commanded cavalry 
varro placed infantry close heavy order reduce front carthaginians 
roman cavalry numbering two thousand four hundred men right wing thus opposed hannibal heavy cavalry eight thousand strong 
cavalry italian allies four thousand eight hundred strong left wing facing numidians 
emilius commanded roman right varro left 
carthaginians faced north wind blowing strongly south swept clouds dust heads full faces enemy 
battle commenced light troops sides fought time obstinately courageously without advantage either 
contest going hannibal advanced center form salient angle projecting front line 
whole gauls spaniards took part movement africans remained stationary time launched heavy cavalry roman horse 
latter instantly overthrown driven field great slaughter 
emilius wounded managed join infantry 
carthaginian heavy horse thus defeating roman cavalry numidians maneuvered near greatly superior cavalry italian allies kept occupied heavy horse destroying roman cavalry swept round behind infantry fell upon rear italian horse numidians charged fiercely front 
thus caught trap italian horse completely annihilated heavy infantry two armies met roman cavalry soldier remained alive unwounded field 
roman infantry advanced charge nature hannibal formation center first came contact head salient angle formed gauls spaniards 
resisted great obstinacy 
principes formed second line roman infantry came forward joined spearmen even triarii pressed forward joined fight 
fighting extreme obstinacy carthaginian center forced gradually back line africans flanks 
romans insensibly pressed flanks upon point met resistance occupied face scarcely half begun battle 
still gauls spaniards driven back formed angle rear original line angle whole roman infantry confused mass pressed upon 
moment hannibal waited 
wheeled round flanks africans hitherto struck blow fell perfect order upon flanks roman mass hasdrubal victorious cavalry charged like torrent upon rear 
followed slaughter unequalled records history 
unable open fight fly quarter asked given romans latin allies fell swords enemies till seventy thousand infantry advanced fight forty thousand fallen field 
three thousand taken prisoners seven thousand escaped small camp ten thousand made way across river large camp joined force left obedience varro orders attacked carthaginian camp repulsed loss two thousand men 
troops camps forced surrender following morning thus fifteen thousand scattered fugitives escaped eighty seven thousand two hundred infantry cavalry command roman consuls 
hannibal loss battle cannae amounted six thousand men 
chapter xix mines exultation carthaginians total destruction enemies immense maharbal leaders urged hannibal march upon rome hannibal knew spirit roman people felt capture rome even annihilation army would greater task could undertake 
history shown desperate defense may made population willing die rather surrender romans essentially martial people would defend city last gasp 
abundance arms two city legions formed regular garrison capital 
instant news defeat reached rome levy males seventeen years age ordered produced another ten thousand men thousand cavalry 
eight thousand slaves willing serve enlisted armed four thousand criminals debtors released prison pardoned condition taking arms 
praetor marcellus ostia ten thousand men embark sicily 
thus rome would defended forty three thousand men hannibal thirty three thousand infantry cavalry strongest arm force would useless 
cannae rome twelve days march army encumbered booty 
could therefore hope surprise 
walls rome exceedingly strong none great machines would necessary siege 
must carried supplies accumulated subsistence force consumed would destitute 
fresh roman levies would gather rear long whole army would besieged 
undertaking would wasted time lost prestige acquired astonishing victory 
varro escaped battle rallied ten thousand fugitives strong place canusium would nucleus round rest escaped would rally would joined fresh levies italian allies rome 
romans showed confidence power resist siege despatching marcellus ten thousand men canusium 
thus strongly defended city front army twenty thousand roman soldiers would speedily increase double number rear hannibal perceived undertake siege rome would risk advantages gained 
determined therefore continue policy laid namely move army fro among provinces italy allies rome one one fell away joined reinforcements arrived carthage would justify undertaking siege rome 
rome never grander hour defeat moment courage confidence citizens shaken 
promptness prepared defense still confidence showed despatching marcellus legion canusium instead retaining defense city show national spirit manliness worthy highest admiration 
varro ordered hand command marcellus return rome answer senate conduct 
varro doubted sentence would death romans like carthaginians little mercy defeated general 
colleague army undoubtedly sacrificed rashness 
moreover senate composed bitter political enemies could hope lenient view would taken conduct 
nevertheless varro returned rome appeared senate 
body nobly responded confidence manifested party feeling suspended political adversary defeated general alike forgotten remembered varro rallied troops allayed panic prevailed among restored order discipline 
courage thus appearing great disaster submit judgment country counted favor 
faults condoned senate publicly thanked despaired commonwealth 
hannibal pursuance policy detach allies italy rome dismissed italian prisoners without ransom 
roman prisoners offered admit ransom deputation accompanied ambassador offer terms peace 
senate however refused discuss terms peace absolutely forbade families friends prisoners ransom thinking politic neither enrich adversary show indulgence soldiers surrendered enemy 
victory cannae hannibal clemency began bear effects hoped 
apulia declared towns arpi celapia opened gates bruttium lucania samnium ready follow 
mago one division army sent bruttium take possession towns might submit 
hanno sent another division lucania 
hannibal marched samnium making alliance tribes stored plunder proceeded campania entered capua second city italy concluded alliance 
mago embarked one ports bruttium carry news hannibal success carthage demand reinforcements 
neither rome carthage complete mastery sea disaster befallen rome land would greatly lessen power maintain large fleet carthage could poured reinforcements ports bruttium without difficulty 
unfortunately hannibal bitterest enemies found italy senate carthage spite appeals mago efforts patriotic party intrigues hanno faction demands made war spain prevented reinforcements forwarded would enabled terminate struggle conquest rome 
hannibal receiving submission several towns capturing casilinum went winter quarters capua 
winter rome made gigantic efforts place army upon war footing success excluding army scipio spain spring began twelve legions hundred twenty thousand men arms reinforcements save elephants small body cavalry ever reached hannibal carthage remaining thirteen years war reduced stand wholly defensive protecting allies harassing enemy feeding army expense yet great dread genius excited spite superior numbers romans cannae never ventured engage pitched battle 
soon winter set hannibal ordered malchus take number officers hundred picked men cross capua sardinia inhabitants revolted rome harassing praetor quintus mucius commanded legion formed garrison island 
malchus officers charged duty organizing wild peasantry island drilling regular tactics unless acting bodies regular troops however much might harass roman legion could hope expel country 
nessus course accompanied malchus 
party embarked two capuan galleys 
many hours sea weather started fine changed suddenly ere long one fierce gales frequent mediterranean burst upon 
wind behind nothing let galleys run 
sea got great rapidity nothing high poops stern prevented two galleys sunk great waves followed 
oars laid impossible use sea 
night came gale increased rather diminished 
carthaginian officers soldiers remained calm quiet storm capuan sailors gave despair men helm kept post malchus threatening thrown overboard instantly abandoned 
nightfall assembled officers cabin poop 
prospects bad said 
pilot tells unless gale abates wind changes shall morning thrown upon coast sardinia total destruction upon side facing italy cliffs part rise straight water port side romans chief castle garrison 
tells nothing done see nought 
try bring galley round wind would swamped moment even could carry operation would impossible row teeth sea 
therefore friends nothing us save keep courage men bid hold readiness seize upon chance getting shore vessel strike 
night galley swept storm 
light boat disappeared soon darkness set 
half soldiers crew turns kept work baling water found way sides several times heavily seas break thought lost 
however morning broke still afloat 
wind hardly shifted point since begun blow pilot told malchus must near coast sardinia 
light brightened every eye fixed ahead waste angry foaming water 
presently pilot standing next malchus grasped arm 
land cried dead us 
minutes later could malchus make faint outline driving mist 
lofty pile rock standing 
island exclaimed 
caralis pilot replied know outline well already bay 
look right make outline cliffs mouth passed already 
see shore ahead rock caralis stands rises level plain left lagoon extends long way roman galleys ride 
gods brought us spot along coast could approach hope safety 
much rejoice malchus said may escape sea made prisoners romans 
nay malchus alternative bad young officer standing next said 
hannibal thousands roman prisoners hands may well hope exchanged 
last twelve hours place shore even roman prison elysium compared sea 
outline coast clearly visible 
great rock caralis known cagliari rose dark threatening low shores bay either side marked band white foam left rock broad lagoon dotted black hulls number ships galleys rolling tossing heavily wind blew straight bay lagoon covered short angry waves 
pilot ordered oars got 
entrance lagoon wide middle channel deep either side long breakwaters stone run shore afford shelter shipping within 
sea rough found impossible use oars laid small sail hoisted 
enabled head laid towards entrance lagoon 
time doubtful whether galley could make succeeded ran straight towards upper end harbor 
far enough pilot said presently water shoals fast beyond 
must anchor 
sail lowered oars got one side head galley brought wind 
anchor dropped 
storm beaten galley ran right lagoon viewed curiosity interest board ships anchor 
italian galley clear also crowded men suspicion entertained carthaginians 
anchor cast malchus held council officers 
midst foes escape seemed altogether impossible 
long gale abated sufficiently permit put sea would visited boats vessels ask whence came 
fighting way question score triremes bay one could crush capuan galley whose far greater speed rendered idea flight hopeless resistance 
council therefore agreed unanimously thing done surrender without resistance 
storm continued another twenty four hours wind died almost suddenly began 
soon sea began abate two galleys seen putting town rowed directly towards ship 
fact shown flag doubt excited suspicion minds garrison 
galley contained fifty soldiers 
rowed alongside roman officer poop one galleys hailed ship demanded whence came 
capua pilot answered 
gale blown us across thence 
board fifty carthaginian officers soldiers surrender 
days vessels could difficulty keep sea storm event gale springing forced run means unusual galleys blown hostile ports announcement excited great surprise 
commands party roman officer asked 
malchus replied 
malchus son hamilcar killed trebia cousin hannibal captain guard 
surrender followers seeing resistance hopeless 
hopeless roman replied right throw away lives men possibility resistance 
spoke stepped board ordered anchor weighed galley accompanied two roman boats rowed landing place 
messenger sent mucius tell happened praetor soon appeared upon spot 
officer acquainted name rank leader carthaginian party said two officers noble families carthaginians 
well praetor said piece good fortune 
carthaginians many officers hands well may exchange

time large number roman garrison among news rapidly spread assembled port 
many young soldiers never yet seen carthaginian looked curiosity interest men inflicted terrible defeats upon armies romans 
fine specimens hannibal force general allowed malchus choose officers men knowing strength agility endurance would needed campaign mountainous country sardinia picked officers men great care 
second command friend trebon long since obtained separate command hearing malchus expedition bound volunteered accompany 
men africans accustomed desert fighting trained warfare spain 
romans good judges physical strength could repress murmur admiration sight sinewy figures 
less heavy spring elasticity resembling tiger 
long use hardened muscles stood like cords tawny skin bore numerous scars wounds received battle romans viewed acknowledged formidable opponents men would 
strong guard formed either side captives marched town citadel upper part rock 
large chamber opening courtyard assigned officers men viewed light slaves set work carry stores citadel ship arrived storm broke 
fortnight later vessel arrived rome message senate would exchange prisoners carthaginians employed slaves mines 
governor acquainted malchus decision 
sorry said indeed senate determined exchange prisoners 
course view matter roman lays arms disgraces refusal ransom allow exchanged intended act deterrent others 
may fair enough cases large numbers surrender lay arms courage determination might cut way enemy cases resistance would hopeless mind men justified surrendering 
however obey orders received tomorrow must send men mines 
malchus seen iberian captives sent labor slaves mines spain fate thus announced appear surprising barbarous 
days captives taken war always made slaves put death cold blood although hannibal treated marked humanity leniency roman italian captives fallen hands result policy means accordance spirit war conducted 
accordingly next day carthaginians strong guard marched away mines lay side island forty miles due west port three miles western sea coast island 
road lay distance across dead flat 
country well cultivated thickly studded villages rome drew heavy tribute corn annually island 
twenty miles march halted night pursuing way following morning

native people wild primitive appearance clad chiefly sheepskins

people possess particle courage trebon said would rise overpower guard make forests 
whole island officer brought us told us covered mountains exception two broad plains running could see hills covered woods whole roman army could find escaped 
true enough malchus said must least five six thousand slaves 
could find food among mountains might exist time upon berries grain would end forced go valleys food would slaughtered romans 
nevertheless small body men could doubt subsist among hills strength guard see heights shows attempts escape rare 
find existence intolerable rate try escape 
fifty us agreed common action could certainly break guards take hills

one lines huts near roman camp assigned carthaginians evening received rations almost black bread similar served others 
following morning set work 
malchus two friends found tasks means labourious appointed look number sards employed breaking sorting lead ore brought mine
