mrs troutbeck delight spent four five evenings home going hour smoke pipe chat fishermen 
twice week would absent night going told aunt night fishing generally returning morning half dozen mackerel fish share night work 
sometimes would ask frank accompany latter particular work hand would thoroughly enjoyed sport 
smuggling time carried extensively nowhere actively weymouth exmouth one hand swanage 
consequently spite vigilance revenue men cargoes frequently run 
long projection chesil beach portland afforded great advantage smugglers lieutenant downes commanded revenue cutter boxer heard declare would gladly subscribe year pay channel could cut beach 
even obtained information cargo likely run west unless winds tides alike propitious took long time get round portland bill certain arrive late interfere landing times adverse wind terrors race tremendous current angry waves would keep boxer lying days west island returning weymouth hear absence lugger landed cargo somewhere east 
job would lost temper revenue officer weymouth lieutenant downes would exclaim angrily 
sir would rather lie three months mouth african river looking slavers stationed weymouth search smuggling craft month enough wear man thread paper 
half coast population seem alliance rascals accustomed false information rule one men gets hint cargo going run near swanage start west knowing well enough wherever affair come certainly within ten miles point named 
even weymouth sympathy population lies rather smugglers revenue men 
long war france rendered brandy french wines lace silks fabulously dear heavy duties charged reduced minimum legitimate traffic might otherwise carried therefore even well people favored men brought luxuries doors mere fraction price would otherwise pay 
element romance career smuggler risked life every day whose adventures escapes fights revenue men told round every fireside 
revenue officer far wrong said greater portion population round coast including classes friendly actual alliance smugglers 
julian well aware many fishermen went often lent hand smugglers landing goods taking inland hiding caves cliffs known smugglers 
heard many stories adventures engaged manner showing signal lights sea induced revenue men hurry spot seen flash leave coast clear landing goods 
must great fun said one day 
must say like take part running cargo 
well master julian would much difficulty really mean 
put easy enough know sir fun 
sometimes revenue men come upon us spite pains take throw scent 
captain downes getting artful one never sure whether got safely away 
fortnight ago pretty nigh came lugger landing cargo lulworth cove

boy followed saw go board boxer 
directly afterwards captain downes came ashore long talk chief coast guard went board chuckled saw boxer get anchor set sail make portland go round end rock 
two hours later look hills saw bearing sea southwest meaning course run bay dark 
shore officer weymouth got horse rode along cliffs eastward 
stopped coast guard station right past lulworth soon afterwards three parts men turned marched away west

one rowed ashore landed two hands look round 
brought back news two three revenue men left station would easy enough seize tie till 
course everything worked bit thought would 
lugger expecting showed light offing signalled coast clear 
dark night two revenue men duty cove seized tied shore band without blow struck

everything ready big lot carts came water edge 
lugger anchored outside cove got kedges rowed dozen shoreboats

came hail answer sink whereupon skipper lugger shouted jennie portsmouth 
lend hand lads sails whispered us slip cable tom 
ran sails jiffy may sure sharper half way four guns flashed 
one hulled lugger others flew overhead 
close could seen us could scarce see shadow cliffs suppose fired voices 
sink tubs lads skipper said lugger glided away us

well may guess get much pains 
carts made soon heard boxer guns knew game night anyhow found every light lulworth everyone seemed fast asleep 
believe heard great row afterwards captain downes revenue officer ashore 
chap ashore would captain fault hurry waited hour would got carts cargo even caught lugger 
well true enough see downes blame came along could sure lugger indeed close cliff like enough would missed altogether gone another two three miles caught noise boats alongside taking kegs 
lugger got away right fast craft though boxer walk along strong wind light breeze lugger legs altogether 
shows mr julian captain downes cut eye teeth mighty hard fool 
never nearer making good capture night 
lugger ran cargo two nights afterwards spot woman told revenue man going 
little bit fight coast guard strong enough good make could bring anything like strong force every bale keg carried inland morning scarce farmhouse within ten miles got stowed away snug hiding places 
downes vicious ever job see master like run goodish risk getting head broke hauled jail 
still would like join night run put way

carry strong crews longish gun sterns case chased may chance knocking away spar anything 
would fight cutter came alongside might make hanging matter none revenue chaps killed case long imprisonment though english part crew generally offer entering king ship instead take 
life board man war may pleasant one better boxed prison years 
anyhow light look 
think julian agreed 
however see great risk landing kegs seldom get nearly caught lulworth 
let know next affair coming bill anywhere within moderate distance weymouth go take 
anyhow whether go may quite sure shall keep matter 
active chap bill said hauled nets boat making way back weymouth faulkner

julian went one occasion bill fishermen look landing contraband cargoes 
distance within walk would start weymouth straight inland come road along carts fetch goods occasionally fishermen would take boats 
lulworth course risk boats fishing east would often make way cove drop anchor hours 
run made lonely spots sight fishing boats making anchor would excited suspicions coast guard cliffs 
number fishermen took part smugglers proceedings small 
either brothers relations board luggers connected smugglers confederates shore 
received handsome sum night work times hard kegs often carried steep dangerous paths top cliffs considerable distance across downs nearest points carts could come 
excitement adventure however rather pay satisfaction derived outwitting revenue men main attraction fishermen 
julian took share work 
went dressed rough clothes wore fishing excursions night heartily enjoyed animated bustle scene scores men carrying kegs bales backs made way narrow ravine silently laid loads beside carts pack horses started back another trip 
occasionally lent hand lash kegs either side horses lift bale cart 
one ever asked question assumed one carts recognized wisdom bill advice first time went

half past one frank went court house 
already crowded captain downes came moment took obtained place solicitors table 
seizure created quite sensation weymouth two three weymouth men among prisoners owing fight taken place matter much serious mere capture contraband goods 
general buzz conversation three magistrates came took places little murmur satisfaction colonel chambers chairman took seat present mr faulkner next seniority would taken chair 
minute later twelve prisoners brought 
five frenchmen two englishmen portion crew smuggler two farmers men drivers carts one local fisherman eleventh one party gone weymouth julian wyatt made number 
two three party heads bandaged one arm sling several others marks hard knocks julian pair black eyes 
little murmur followed entry prisoners subsided crier called silence court inquiry began 
mr moorsby first witness 
deposed received information landing contraband goods likely take place accompanied mr faulkner represented civil authorities went spot 
perceived landing goods taking place arranged party show revenue cutter came seized lugger remained hiding heard man placed shore cutter coming 
rushed seized parties engaged proceedings 
resisted violently serious fray took place 
three men wounded pistol shots one seriously 
one smugglers killed three seriously injured could present placed dock 
prisoners represented court chairman asked 
solicitor sitting next frank rose 
represent mr julian wyatt said 
frank looked surprise 
idea obtaining legal assistance julian occurred wondered brother able communicate solicitor 
would suggest honor latter went evidence taken separately different charges considerable difference position prisoners 
another solicitor rose 
appear john turnbull william sims said would support appeal mr probert 
clients farming men took part whatever fray serious portion affair 
ready admit engaged illegal operation aiding landing contraband goods shall able prove innocent serious charge resisting force capture revenue officers using deadly weapons representatives law case stands altogether different category main body prisoners 
intend hope mr faulkner said express wish would practically twelve investigations instead one witnesses obliged go number times box 
means honor intimating intention cross examining witness share clients took affair pointing beforehand case stands entirely different footing men took part serious charge resisting officers 
one another coast guard men gave evidence identifying one prisoners whose capture taken personal part 
none first five anything say regarding julian 
james wingfield entered box 
stating coxswain weymouth coast guard boat proceeded mr moorsby gave order ran forward 
saw biggish man standing hands pockets pea jacket 
seemed looking work thinking might leader harry wilkens ran seized 
afterwards knew mr julian wyatt 
caught handed wilkens know 
proceeded testify several prisoners whose capture taken part 
finished evidence julian solicitor rose 
say prisoner first took mr wyatt taking active part affair sir standing looking 
resist capture say resist sir 
first clapped hands gave start come upon sudden without noise 
tried shake us knowing reckon soon said king name prisoner quiet lamb 
solicitor sat 
chairman asked witness arms found prisoner 
sir 
even stick say may bit stick honor though notice hands pockets anyhow try use 
wilkens next witness evidence far julian concerned precisely similar coxswain 
seven men lugger evidence conclusive 
resisted desperately enabled several party make escape darkness 
weymouth fisherman caught coming beach keg shoulder thrown attempted run away made resistance taken two farm men captured horses heads surrendered 
evidence gone mr probert addressed court behalf julian 
urged evidence whatever show concerned either smuggling operations resistance revenue officers 
pretend said accident maintain simply capacity looker 
stands fact precisely position member general public might present spectator sort riot 
unquestionably unwise action part individual attend meeting sort possible riotous proceedings may take place maintain however imprudent foolish nothing criminal sure case record man punished presence riot participate 
client acted foolishly ask court say foolishness criminal 
accidentally learned landing contraband goods thoughtlessness youth went see considered fun 
even shadow criminality present ask say unpleasant experience undergone detention twelve hours police cell appearance ample punishment boyish escapade might committed high spirited young fellow nineteen 
solicitor addressed court behalf two farmers men magistrates consulted together 
spectators watching attentively saw time seemed unanimous equally evident difference opinion point presently rose left court 
faulkner two mr probert whispered frank 
course unanimous smugglers expect differed others 
lucky colonel chair 
harrington mild little fellow faulkner would able twist round finger two fear colonel keep straight 
ten minutes returned flushed angry face mr faulkner frank judged overruled 
chairman briefly announced decision court committed seven smugglers trial whole charges 
weymouth fisherman also committed charge engaged unlawful act defrauding majesty revenue allowed bail 
two farm labourers fined fifty pounds apiece solicitor paid 
majority bench favor immediate discharge mr wyatt opinion evidence failed altogether prove charges opinion already paid dearly enough reckless folly attending unlawful operation kind trust lesson life 
serious charge taken 
frank act rising seat delight julian acquittal sank dismay concluding words 
idea charge 
whispered mr probert 
faulkner charged attempt murder 
heard frightened 
seen witnesses doubt case break like 
prisoners julian removed dock mr faulkner left bench took seat body court 
charge read clerk mr faulkner name called stepped witness box low hiss ran fishermen formed large proportion spectators 
silence chairman said angrily 
hear repetition indecent demonstration court cleared 
mr faulkner proceeded give evidence 
said spoken severely prisoner quality magistrate upon taking part smuggling transactions 
prisoner became violently abusive uttered murderous threats thought would struck self defense witness gave blow whereupon prisoner sprung upon like tiger lifted arms carried bodily towards fire would assuredly thrown prevented coast guardsmen 
mr probert rose quietly 
magistrate mr faulkner believe mr faulkner gave reply question little pause solicitor went consider magistrate mr faulkner comes within province abuse prisoner unconvicted crime deny abused mr faulkner said hotly 
occasion heat sir mr probert said quietly 
position witness present magistrate must reply like witness 
well deny abused 
consider calling gentleman good standing town son distinguished officer loafing young scoundrel abuse telling six months one majesty jails would world good deny used words 
well sir question pure credibility 
possible may position prove satisfaction bench use many others equally offensive character 
mr wyatt naturally resented language right address would address 
magistrate forgets position abuses prisoner language fish fag must expect answered way anyone spirit 
say thereupon became abusive used murderous threats like hear little 
first let us hear abuse tell court please mr faulkner abusive expressions added 
said sir disgrace bench 
general laugh court instantly repressed 
mr faulkner eyes ran furiously crowded benches 
must ask look mr faulkner solicitor said mildly 
well said disgrace bench 
scarcely perhaps much matter abuse one private opinion 
say next said curse whole neighborhood 
mere matter opinion 
sneaking meddlesome interfering old fox 
buzz laughter mingled exclamations far wrong upon colonel chalmers directed constable turn offending parties court 
fishermen nearest door hustled 
well afraid must admit mr probert said call meddlesome old fox abusive although nothing like abusive call man loafing young scoundrel 
threats 
said would brought home one days bullet body 
purely matter prophecy mr faulkner threat unless intended understand would fire bullet 
mean tell court reason suppose young gentleman whose reputation untarnished never charge brought except ridiculous one dismissed intended imply words idea taking life might bear construction 
might bear construction mind man determined see everything worst possible light 
matter public notoriety mr faulkner received several threatening letters active part taken poachers smugglers caused feeling 
think likely mr wyatt used words repeated referred circumstance magistrate duty must necessarily unpopular criminal classes 
possibly mr faulkner though known many magistrates duty means unpopular answered question 
think saying mr wyatt simply alluded fact well known unpopularity threatening letters received possibly mr faulkner admitted reluctantly although impression time 
well unless threats call think disposed alleged abuse alleged murderous threats 
come charge 
thought strike self defense gave blow 
made think going strike made step towards threatening gesture 
oh dare say angry gentleman called loafing young scoundrel somewhat apt lose temper 
might even mr faulkner addressed 
well made step towards thereupon struck face judging appearance struck pretty hard say caught carried along 
says good deal strength able 
say carried towards fire would thrown upon coast guardsmen interfered time 
know intention firmly believe 
question belief 
might believe going throw moon 
struggled suppose would scarcely submit carried like baby imagine long short 
even intended throw fire certainly seems merely matter imagination hardly pretend carried intention would murder 
surely score friends standing would hauled immediately none worse except singes burn two 
burning fiery furnace mr faulkner merely bit bonfire sticks set fire order throw little light proceedings 
might seriously burnt 
well even supposing question murder 
presume framed indictment charged prisoner intention committing grievous damage upon murder admit circumstances death could hardly resulted possibility imaginary intention throwing fire carried clear charge murder must drop 
questions ask though may remarks make heard witnesses 
chapter iii fresh scrape first witness called mr faulkner captain downes 
tell us know affair chairman said 
captured smuggler took six men went see could assistance mr moorsby also hear whether successful capture 
found everything fire lighted 
talking mr moorsby attention excited loud words mr faulkner mr wyatt acquainted 
mr faulkner struck face scuffle prisoner lifting magistrate although much heavier man completely feet 
course scuffle approached fire afraid might fall ran mr moorsby men pulled away 
seem captain downes prisoner carrying mr faulkner straight fire certainly going straight direction whether intentionally unable say 
think men interfered would fallen fire think would certainly done 
think prisoner intended throw mr faulkner fire say 
questions ask witness mr faulkner chairman asked 
think likely suppose prisoner could intended tumble fire think unlikely 
mr faulkner sat mr probert rose 
think unlikely captain downes mr wyatt would deliberately walked fire quite share opinion yet proved deliberately going towards fire 
say lifted mr faulkner arms 
seems done would able see way going mr wyatt eyes would level mr faulkner chest moreover must evident judging present appearance could scarcely seen anything receiving blow 
strike still likely partially blinded unwilling strike magistrate return however much latter forfeited claim respect closed heat passion lifted carried along random think likely lieutenant replied 
struck prisoner struck captain downes course think would proper pursue know would proper know done 
magistrate magistrate knocked assailant rate tried 
naval man captain downes experience conduct gentlemen generally observe prisoners 
presume custom strike even make somewhat free use tongues certainly captain downes said emphatically 
would go far say would consider disgraceful cowardly act consider 
murmur applause court instantly arrested mr probert held hand deprecatingly 
thank captain downes went 
come question quarrel gave rise affair 
mr faulkner thought fit ask questions 
standing close enough hear passed standing close mr faulkner prisoner spoke loudly enough heard distance 
magistrate first began conversation 
used strong language strong 
think justified using strong language certainly thought improper 
think gentleman accosted improperly greatly blamed uses strong language return would doubt better held tongue time called account afterwards 
still provocation strong captain downes could altogether blame 
blame witness said curtly 
think mr faulkner suddenly struck prisoner face answer question witness asked bench 
think improper question chairman replied 
well sir 
must say thought one blackguardly cowardly things ever saw done 
thank captain downes 
think necessary ask questions 
witnesses call mr faulkner chairman asked coldly 
mr faulkner face white rage 
dozen witnesses said hoarsely doubt follow lead officer set 
shall therefore call 
think worships mr probert said rising necessary address 
would submit shadow evidence support charge attempt murder 
abusive language say client words retort courteous retort natural simply consequence extraordinary conduct mr faulkner acting time capacity magistrate 
charge threatening language altogether absurd 
client simply asserted true common report mr faulkner threatened possible threats might day carried effect 
therefore leave case hands worships 
two magistrates put heads together short time 
chairman said bench opinion charge attempted murder altogether without foundation abusive language use threats never brought seeing result consider ill judged improper conduct plaintiff 
therefore discharged mr wyatt colleague express hope preceding charge may prove lesson avoid taking part even spectator breeches law led regrettable occurrence 
magistrate concluded roar applause rose court 
vain constables shouted silence 
chairman ordered room cleared time motioned julian leave court preparing 
court cleared called julian

following morning frank met captain downes learned right conjecture retained mr probert services julian behalf magistrates 
next days julian kept house except nightfall went long walk 
report proceedings court caused great sensation weymouth feeling strong mr faulkner hooted streets rode town 
general expectation would resign position bench end week private meeting magistrates held whispered town report proceedings court sent home secretary expression opinion mr faulkner brother magistrates felt could sit bench taken place 
ten days affair julian started early one morning day rabbit shooting house friend lived six miles valley 
snow fell course afternoon put stop shooting started walk home 
within hundred yards mr faulkner place heard horse coming along behind 
snow fallen deadened sound hoofs road looking round saw mr faulkner riding fast distance fifty yards away 
caught sight sooner julian would left road entered wood avoid late hoped rate man would pass without speaking 
horseman apparently recognized julian came abreast sudden exclamation reined horse 
illustration mark words young scoundrel even yet 
julian wyatt said tone suppressed fury 
mr faulkner julian replied quietly want anything say think better go way without interfering 
mark words young scoundrel even yet 
debt side mr faulkner 
got debt pay perhaps day may square matters got score coast guardsmen back 
however content leave matters long 
owing debt thank trouble got mine 
however warn better abstain insulting 
strike back hit last time call scoundrel shall see hit hard teach keep civil tongue head 
mark words mr faulkner repeated 
watched hunt mistaken put rope round neck one days 
saying struck spurs horse galloped 
julian stood looking saw turn gate 
drive house led knew diagonally wood walked forward heard horse galloping hoofs grow louder louder 
suddenly report gun seventy eighty yards away 
mingled sudden cry julian heard horse galloping even faster 
exclamation good heavens something happened broke hedge ran direction sound 
approached thought caught sight man running trees kept straight came upon drive 
twenty yards away mr faulkner lay stretched ground 
went stooped 
eyes closed lay back julian saw blood oozing bullet hole coat high left side chest 
feeling sure mr faulkner dead started without moment hesitation ran wood direction thought seen figure 
minute later came upon footprints bare spot trees snow fallen lightly 
noting direction took followed 
saw signs footprints followed direction nearly could came farthest side wood leaped field beyond followed edge wood reached road 
turned went back fifty yards point first run came upon footprints 
going take hills muttered set along track 
ran trot went loaded barrels gun 
likely villain show fight said must take surprise 
quarter mile run reached foot hill near crest three quarters mile away caught sight figure man 
moment later passed crest 
julian started full speed hill 
need follow footprints indeed strong wind blowing swept snow hollows face hill bare 
reached top hill decreased distance considerably 
saw surprise man bearing right course would ere long bring edge cliff 
run hill left breathless time man also running fully maintained lead 
julian began gain upon 
man changed course going parallel line cliffs 
three miles point reached top julian within quarter mile 
would caught obliged times make detours avoid passing high ground man looked back would perceived 
time almost sure fugitive poacher recently released term two years prison poaching mr faulkner preserves 
last saw turn sharp right 
earth going julian said 
cliffs many hundred yards away 
hitherto supposed man keeping away cliff avoid meeting coast guards would duty change direction puzzled completely 
keeping eye poacher saw enter small clump bushes emerge 
julian slackened pace walk 
likely enough man noticed pursued determined rid pursuer 
pleasant idea fellow might kneeling among bushes gun shoulder 
could hardly either said intended shoot would turned way sound gun would probably heard coast guard could fail see running away 
rate muttered going turn back chase 
standing still looking spot saw clump bushes grew slight hollow turning right would able approach within twenty thirty yards without exposing view 
short time lost sight bushes 
moving great caution made way towards approached slope hollow lay crawled along keeping gun front 
neared spot lay stomach short turf wound along could see bushes 
gun shoulder finger trigger gazed hollow 
surprise could see signs fugitive 
leafless boughs afforded slight shelter gazing fixedly two three minutes became convinced man longer 
soon came conclusion stood looked surrounding country 
bleak bare entirely destitute hedges shelter 
five six minutes utmost lost sight bushes time man could got far 
earth hidden julian muttered 
went clump bushes still holding gun readiness instant use 
patch thirty feet long half wide 
walked backwards forwards among low bushes fugitive certainly 
going end patch could see plainly enough track man entered although little snow top ground lay among tufts grass 
walked round clump signs footsteps leaving 
rummest thing ever saw muttered fellow flown away yet certainly walked 
thinking idea suddenly occurred 
sailing along coast bill latter one day pointed hole cliff twenty feet high water mark 
see hole mr julian yes see plain enough 
well sir owned goods taken hole dark still nights rich man 
mean say run cargoes bill kegs heavy awkward get away laces silks like 
many lugger comes abroad lands sorts things sails away takes chance running rest cargo somewhere else 
anyone get see nothing like path 
path sir 
revenue men would found long ago 
boat comes along said dark night swell chaps inside show tiny light guide spot 
boat comes lower rope haul bales boat goes back lugger ups sail one wiser 
stuff mean stow get away passage somewhere bill replied 
know goes 
reckon half dozen men weymouth know 
say except men whose business take goods inland forward london one chap secret weymouth jail 
joe markham 
poaching 
good many years sailed one french luggers 
heard keeper cave bit give well known coast guard kept sharp eye venture go 
enough sea doubt got money laid anyhow took cottage river took poaching devilment say wanted money 
expect well paid smugglers used get half stories put scent never missed present run made 
conversation came back julian memory stood clump bushes wondering become man pursued flashed upon spot standing could far smugglers cavern entrance might well among bushes 
man knew entrance nothing likely make place concealment opportunity occurred get board lugger cross channel 
likely place men could come go night without risk seen heard coast guardsmen cliff would likely encounter anyone within two three miles 
years might pass without anyone happening enter bushes 
laying gun julian began search earnest 
half hour feeling coarse grass came upon handle 
pulled gently first yield exerted strength gave way section rough herbage rose three feet away sank proportion 
raising higher saw trap door two feet wide five feet long eighteen inches deep fact deep tray pivoted center filled earth grass grew freely ground adjoining 
greater portion trap overhung bushes grew thickly around part sank probability small indeed anyone would tread upon 
julian saw handle bolt fastened would hold trap firmly 
doubt man haste forgotten fasten descended 
looking julian saw circular hole like well evidently artificially made chalk ladder fastened one side 
illustration julian finds prisoner among smugglers 
julian hesitated 
return weymouth inform authorities traced murderer mr faulkner place concealment bring arrest go encounter single handed although fearless disposition would decided prudent course done would let authorities knowledge smugglers cave 
although determined nothing felt would act treachery believed bill absolutely trustworthy latter told existence cavern secret exit without information would never searched discovered trap door 
thought credit would gain capture murderer single handed would go far efface memory disgrace befallen helped decide 
fetched gun slung shoulder got upon ladder pulled trap door behind 
found moved easily could push without difficulty feeling bolt discovered partially shot sufficiently catch fairly although containing far hold frame torn groove somewhat rotten wood force used raise 
went ladder cautiously descending thirty steps foot encountered solid ground 
moment consideration knelt proceeded hands knees 
almost immediately felt ground slope away front 
got feet 
holding arms found passage four feet wide began descend extreme care feeling way along walls 
gone thought fifty yards passage made sharp turn still descending considerable distance ahead light streamed rugged hole 
walked confidently soon light sufficient enable see path following 
arriving aperture saw expected looking sea 
one side hole shelf cut chalk 
stained oil guessed look spot signalling craft offing 
path turned ran parallel face cliff 
occasion exercise care walking light streamed openings inches long 
unslung gun stooped took boots proceeded noiselessly 
descent considerable places steps cut 
last arrived door 
roughly solidly made would doubtless sustain attack time yielded would give time occupants case trap door discovered make escape lower entrance beach 
latch 
lifting quietly found door yielded holding gun right hand ready cover fugitive moment entered julian threw door wide open sprang forward 
calculated descent floor cave five feet fell heavily upon gun going struck floor 
instantaneous fall eyes taken scene 
several lanterns faintly lit cave center table several figures sitting illuminated three four candles 
partly stunned heaviness fall vaguely heard shouts surprise alarm minute later roughly seized dragged along 
felt tightly bound 
minutes left could see three men guns hands standing near door entered listening attentively 
presently heard steps coming passage two men came door shut bolted carefully came steps cabin 
spoke comrades came news evidently satisfactory men leaned guns wall came table 
talk minutes julian raised placed sitting position head cask table 
one men addressed french 
julian time recovered effects fall shook head 
spoke poacher seated opposite julian latter said young fellow tried court three weeks ago yes 
thought 
day got weymouth 
well deuce chap followed way hill julian nodded 
follow road shot faulkner 
heard gun ran found dead 
caught sight wood went chase 
intend young fool intended capture julian said fearlessly 
done good service well 
reason bear good men told though downes got true going throw faulkner fire 
struck furious passion different thing altogether shooting man cold blood 
got two years imprisonment man said mind good reason shooting got chance another thing would never leave us alone always heels 
two three men prison got sent eight waiting trial 
made war us turned tables 
heard several runs course fellows 
get know entrance place knew cave used smugglers entrance somewhere 
man told knew well trusted disappeared among bushes footprints show left appeared passage might looked found handle trap door 
go call coast guard station quarter mile away 
could done without betraying secret cavern 
found entrance never done told cave secret passage felt would act treachery betray 
really fool enough think captured single handed walk like lamb gallows intend give chance making fight 
intended rush straight covered gun 
well plenty pluck young fellow much wisdom think getting shall let go bring constables mistaken altogether 
chapter iv smuggler cave joe markham soon arrived told french smugglers shot magistrate last five six years given much trouble caused much loss last affair showed become dangerous ever could obtained information exact point landing bribed someone connected 
case life business said 
got way must given trade altogether part coast besides cause several seizures cargoes death eight ten comrades imprisonment many others 
way shall find things great deal easier 
served right leader party said rendered good service going think suspicion fall upon yes put awkward position afraid 
thought job well managed could never traced got top hill saw fellow starting bottom 
think much time came quickly must run way 
chased hard got nearer could see gun 
quarter mile away got trap door 
hide bushes put bullet markham several reasons 
first place gun might heard cussed revenue men 
would inquiry search 
would seen direction going must shot bushes one would sight ran thing would puzzle may sure would suspected must hidden way clump 
besides would probably hunted every inch ground see could find anything would give clue fired shot 
one reason 
quite good enough without others frenchman said 
well another one went almost much 
shot faulkner curse us 
imprisoned several pals done lot damage trade likely break altogether besides big grudge account 
liked shoot fellow cold blood 
feeling done harm even know 
overtaken open may sure made fight would life 
pretend soft little enough fought hard several times old days surprised could shot fellow without giving chance life 
trap door escape stood given fair warning fought man man 
point conversation arrested sudden entrance julian 
chief smugglers asked joe finished conversation prisoner 
spy young chap lives town 
pal friends landings goods 
caught last affair got could prove actually engaged business 
enemy faulkner row faulkner hit face 
see mark still would thrown faulkner bonfire lit prevented coast guards 
heard friends cavern entrance somewhere came look trap door 
certainly pushed bolt forward came hurry suppose could caught rightly 
well done joe know 
see knows shooting faulkner 
would trust peach cavern trap door know would thing 
seems likely suspected hand 
row faulkner talk place faulkner found bullet first fellow suspected 
well see would able account three four hours afterwards might driven peach save life would obliged give story following coming 
would end best hiding place country able show face side channel 
say safest plan would cut throat chuck sea done 
poacher said positively 
lugger night take across us france 
well one men said prevent coming back could prevent somehow 
could get tale english sailor picked sea hand authorities tell story fallen overboard english ship war 
would send away place interior keep english prisoners war might lie years perhaps never get back 
know word french saw spoke contradict story may tell chance questions asked say suits us 
might ruin us came back smuggler growled 
likely come back poacher said 
heard die like flies prisons besides guarantee never split place 
gentleman get swear may sure break oath 
well come back years take chance 
got evidence would word mine 
would tell story tell mine mine would likely 
say met hills gun knowing cause got hate faulkner told shot asked get board smuggler craft across channel done know 
afraid anything might say comes back 
julian watched speakers anxiously conversation 
wholly ignorant french tone manner speakers gathered poacher speaking favor 
expected mercy life nothing french smugglers surprised find man whose life thought held hand released apparently pleading cause 
look young fellow poacher said turning towards 
first place men afraid may betray existence place opinion best thing make us safe would cut throat throw mouth cave sea 
told knew cave one friends could trusted keep secret rate demand first place shall take oath never split 
willingly enough julian said great feeling relief 
joe markham dictated terrible oath always taken made acquainted existence cave julian repeated 
poacher told smugglers julian sworn 
young fellow may tell going take france night 
may think shall asking take another oath like say anything going 
shot man pretend sorry 
hard bad chap got deserved 
owed long score others shot someone else would done sooner later 
shall prevent coming back though think say anything come back 
first place like enough shall take sea may settled france return 
next place may dead got evidence 
told story course say lie shot man got way sending across france lugger think see best keep quiet tongue head anyhow ready take chance 
horribly alarmed get home night julian said 
well must alarmed poacher said carelessly 
interfered business none got take consequences may think lucky fellow time drifting tideway 
feel julian said though understand word said sure owing 
could promised would never say word anyone one never tell one may placed done think safely promise never go way denounce 
want promise poacher replied 
made mind leave weymouth jail two years shall always constables well revenue men keeping eye intended along take lugger live board stayed could settle accounts faulkner 
doubt suspect business 
plenty men know sworn even disappearance sure put 
next place promise try escape get take ropes dare say thinking could get free would make run mouth cave dive high water 
julian fact thinking saw unless gave promise would remain cords cutting wrists took required oath 
joe told frenchmen unfastened julian cords 
may well carry bales leader said gets dark 
use giving anyone sea chance seeing light 
tell take one come us 
going leave promise promise 
poacher translated order julian 
bales taken beneath tarpaulin end cave shouldering one proceeded passage reached foot ladder 
laid bales returned cave 
julian asked 
yes bales worth lot money 
fifteen hundred pounds worth lace one 
others silks satins worth another five hundred 
night hear signal three frenchmen go 
shall find two men shall carry bales place mile half away hidden convenient send london wherever going dispose business finished hand us money 
come eight clock ten lugger coast send boat ashore us 
got five six hours yet say best thing turn sleep till 
plenty blankets corner pile sheep skins sleep 
julian nodded threw two three sheep skins corner rolled another pillow drew blanket first time looked round cave 
lighted small hole used look present blanket hung 
door similar entered leading lower cave 
far lower entrance might julian means knowing view obtained sea large loop hole passed descent think cavern could less seventy eighty feet water 
sole ventilation far could see current air found way door passed could come loop hole seawards 
doubtless warmer weather doors stood open closed warmth purpose although noticed lower one bolted locked first captured 
lay wondered going end 
position perilous uncertain 
far escaped better could expected looks frenchmen given doubt fate would man chasing spoken favor 
life therefore seemed present safe future dark 
poacher spoken likely return years 
surely could intend keep board ship time 
could mean put upon vessel sailing abroad way frank aunt would would learn started home early afternoon would absolutely certain could strayed road met accident coming along valley 
would certainly awkward missed day faulkner shot especially according time started home would come along road somewhere time magistrate shot 
horrible thought suspicion might fall upon 
knew would sure could nothing whatever murder still thought felt suspicions certain rise would find extremely difficult explain matters return 
memory quarrel magistrate fresh everybody mind even friends might well consider singular words faulkner soon carried effect 
true joe markham would missing man acquaintances would great difficulty guessing carried threats faulkner would certainly communicate opinion constables latter might think man connection murder notice longer seen town 
even free leave cave return weymouth would find awkward position 
course shadow evidence save known quarrelled faulkner must near spot moment killed could explain six seven hours absence could say caught sight man plantation followed miles among hills lost sight last 
shadow evidence produce confirmation story fact direct evidence either way 
could doubt would remain cloud suspicion 
bad enough would altogether intolerable perhaps best taken away future decided 
gone anyhow doubt would able get opportunity writing frank setting mind rest safety telling something happened kidnapped carried france 
acted like fool doubt frank would understand followed first impulse gone alone man committed murder instead going constables telling unknown man killed magistrate 
one thing seemed certain never able go back weymouth unless affair cleared see ever could 
point julian thoughts became confused 
voices men talking table seemed get away conscious nothing heard bell tinkle faintly somewhere overhead 
movement cave sat 
men went upper door 
left got went see lower door fastened could open 
idea breaking word curiosity rather feeling 
found bolts could pulled back lock strong one jamb point bolt shot covered piece iron instrument could used forcing back bolt 
may thought prisoner confined time possibly done order trap door found revenue men come way smugglers flight might lock door behind time get away boat along foot cliffs pursuers could get lower entrance open fire upon 
lay 
wondered whether pull bell heard could hidden grass like handle trap 
might small knob looked closely among bushes wondered escaped 
three four minutes french captain came walked across lying pauvre diable muttered went back table filled glass spirits water lit pipe 
moment later thought seemed strike came across julian touched 
sat 
frenchman motioned come table went cupboard brought wooden platter large lump cold beef loaf bread cheese poured horn brandy water motioned eat 
julian attacked food vigorously 
lunch friends starting walk back weymouth nearly seven hours run across hills keen air given sharp appetite full justice food 
bad fellow said smuggler finished brought box cigars placed 
would knocked head without compunction way business concluded dangerous comes good fellow 
nodded pleasantly frenchman lit cigar excellent one far better julian accustomed smoke associates billiard room 
frenchman thoughts dissimilar 
brave gar said makes best things 
fine looking fellow big man another year two 
misfortune got take shut prison 
mix affair markham way boys 
instead grateful man killed enemy must needs run done injury 
well helped least make comfortable long board lugger 
another half hour joe markham returned french sailors

saw poacher said true

julian one best tempered fellows world still would admit heat moment might raise gun fire say loaded gun faulkner gone sure empty came along never known bring home gun loaded went hid behind tree shot man 
would believe fifty honest men swore much less oath fellow like faulkner 
say anything mr wyatt duty 
yes understand mr henderson 
course must arrested sure one believe accusation minute 
oh exclaimed fresh idea struck faulkner shot bullet wound 
well quite enough frank exclaimed triumphantly 
julian double barrelled gun rabbit shooting fired would charge shot 
suppose went bullet pocket use case happened meet faulkner another row 
julian never fired bullet life far know 
thing bullet mould house 
officer look gravity relaxed 
important certainly said important 
hearing deposition read seem result unfortunate quarrel brother might goaded something mr faulkner said hastily loaded gun passion run across wood shot 
clear say improbable would bullet unless proved obtained one gunmaker otherwise strong point favor 
suppose brother returned afternoon 
asked servant got home three whether returned though expect back soon said come sure done since 
intrude longer 
shall place one men front house one behind comes home arrest managed quietly bring 
save painful scene 
officer left frank returned aunt 
frank asked 
well aunt absurd affair absurd painful 
warrant arrest julian charge attempting murder mr faulkner 
mrs troutbeck gave cry burst fit hysterical laughter 
vainly trying pacify frank went servant wild screams laughter continued put hat ran family doctor lived doors away 
briefly related circumstances case brought back house 
long time violence paroxysm passed leaving mrs troutbeck weak carried frank doctor room 
worry aunt frank said laid upon bed come right last 
cleared doubt short time 
soon maid undressed mrs troutbeck got bed doctor went gave opiate went parlor frank told story full warning must say nothing deposition mr faulkner read court 
grave affair frank old doctor said 
known brother childhood convinced however much deposition true false julian never fired shot say bullet makes still conclusive needed certainly 
brother exceedingly sweet even temper 
father often spoken almost regret saying would much better little little spice temper 
still unfortunate returned 
course may met friend town gone home may stayed mr merryweather think stopped town anyhow frank said first thing would heard got back would shooting faulkner would sure come home talk 
course may stopped merryweathers afraid 
fancy part faulkner story must true could never accused julian met near gate julian case could easily proved time 
think meet likely row 
know faulkner understand met julian would likely say something might quarrel think story julian coming looking either pure fancy lie 
doubt thinking rode along badly wounded perhaps altogether insensible may imagined rest 
quite possible doctor agreed case julian coming home extraordinary 
met faulkner two three clock since question frank could answer 
tell sir said long pause really imagine 
still nothing world would make believe julian charged 
several times frank went outside door constable still 
last sitting looking fire time put cap went residence chief constable 
excuse mr henderson thinking ever since left 
whoever murder probably return road struck somewhere across fields 
snow enough middle day cover ground stopped falling two clock snowed since 
might suggest morning search made round edge wood 
footprints found might great importance 
quite right mr wyatt already determined go couple constables daylight 
may go sir please 
must remember evidence footprints may find may unfavourable brother 
slightest fear frank said confidently 
well mr wyatt 
two constables half past seven shall ready start 
chance late doubt able overtake us get 
next morning frank office half hour appointed time 
fortunately snow fallen night 
chief constable looked grave anxious search began frank excited rather anxious 
fear whatever result investigation would disclose nothing felt certain julian disadvantage 
continued absence latter unaccountable felt absolutely certain would explained satisfactorily return 
moment got across hedge fields skirting wood chief constable exclaimed stay men footprints edge trees come carefully examined 
think went turning frank would much better go see might call witness mr henderson whatever find shall objection witness certain shall find nothing tend incriminate brother 
see thinking footprints julian idea 
rate marks well made boot large size without heavy nails 
constable nodded 
two sets said one going way distance apart fact heel deeply marked rest print whoever made running 
certainly frank agreed ran hedge turned 
done probably saw vehicle persons walking along road wish seen 
possibly mr henderson case keep among trees coming going instead exposing must done running hedge thin one walking along much less driving could seen 
mr henderson looked frank closer scrutiny given 
acute observer mr wyatt 
point important one 
man wishing avoid observation would certainly kept among trees 
let us follow footprints along may learn something 
presently came point julian come wood 
see wood mr wyatt constable said 
quite see frank said 
marks julian boots think found came wood point ran purpose without attempt concealment far hedge turned ran back past point left wood 
let us see afterwards may give us clue whole matter 
fifty yards came spot julian turned poacher track 
mr henderson frank exclaimed triumphantly 
another man came wood man roughly made boots hob nails 
man came first quite evident 
tracks line julian many places top running fast 
look see julian strides longest therefore probably running fastest 
say mr wyatt 
lighter footprints obliterate heavier boots several places 
meaning second man wood whole thing perfectly plain frank said excitedly 
julian road heard report gun close wood perhaps heard cry jumped hedge made spot possibly mr faulkner said ran drive stooped started pursuit murderer may possibly obtained sight 
enough snow trees follow footprints therefore ran edge wood road search man track 
turned ran back till came upon leaving wood set pursuit 
jove mr wyatt officer said think explanation right one 
give hand lad doubt five minutes ago brother fit passion shot mr faulkner standing 
declare think acted say 
struck upon beats altogether 
thinking nothing else night mr henderson 
put julian position seemed hearing gun fired close hand even hear cry julian knowing often man threatened might run spot might behaved faulkner says 
seemed simple enough julian absence difficulty way could possibly account followed murderer 
imprudent mr henderson said gravely 
sort thing julian would done 
however far went ought back 
anxious mr henderson 
course ought back 
terribly afraid something happened 
man whoever must desperate character taken one life revenge would hesitate take another secure safety 
great advantage julian know gun carried bullets julian nothing small shot 
way shall go next mr henderson shall follow track go wood go wood take us comparatively short time saying far may lead us 
call two men take ground show discoveries made 
well many witnesses possible 
two constables called taken along line track chief constable pointed man well made boots evidently running 
entered wood 
carefully searching found prints boots 
went drive starting spot mr faulkner found made large tree thirty yards left 
thought mr henderson said 
someone standing think little time 
see ground kicked bit though hard show marks boots plainly many scratches grooves would made hob nails 
lads search closely find wad material point 
five minutes search one men picked piece half burned paper 
frank uttered exclamation satisfaction held 
julian always used wads 
never came gun 
let us go back tree mr henderson see way man went firing shot 
careful search found heavy footprints several spots snow lay near also found traces lighter boots 
trees grew thicker following line indicated footprints came spot left wood 
see mr henderson frank said julian lost footprints bore little left striking edge wood man left road 
sir find spot julian first left road try trace footsteps spot mr faulkner lying 
know shot fired behind tree brother footsteps miss spot altogether think case absolutely proved 
went back road found julian crossed untrodden snow hedge pushed way latter 
footprints could found fortunately ten yards right tree open space across evidently run 
proved case mr wyatt chief constable said shaking frank cordially hand 
indeed glad 
whoever man shot mr faulkner certainly brother 
let us start tracks 
frank face became serious previous search soon took double track across fields 
felt absolutely confident whatever might find could tend clear julian terrible accusation upon contrary feared discovery might make would confirm suspicions evil befallen 
scarcely word spoken passed along fields 
man hob nailed boots taking hills chief constable remarked 
afraid mr henderson bare snow chance following 
came point snow ended stopped 
end search mr wyatt 
must return town 
magistrates meet eleven clock constables must 
send two men directly get back go along cliffs question men duty yesterday afternoon whether saw two men guns crossing hills one probably distance behind 
think perhaps better come court 
say absolutely necessary think would better see would useless hunting hills alone 
soon court take four men start search 
saying whether may find sign 
shall glad go shown born detective morning trained life could followed scent unerringly 
certainly go mr henderson court house 
would start hills nothing eat morning much important want ease aunt mind 
course certain julian nothing whatever naturally immense relief know suspicion dreadful crime longer rests 
frank returned home found mrs troutbeck prostrated shock still bed doctor ordered remain 
soon however heard frank back sent come 
delight extreme told discoveries made constables doubt warrant julian arrest would withdrawn 
became anxious found frank could give satisfactory explanation long absence 
would trouble aunt said soothingly doubt shall hear long 
let us content come well terrible accusation former charge let us hope explanation absence satisfactory hear 
even thought julian got trouble would infinitely easier bear knowledge suspected murder would murder aunt 
heard faulkner died last night 
meeting magistrates informal one agreed directly heard julian custody could proceed matter 
mr henderson answering first question followed private room 
lay hands last night colonel chambers said 
shall alter warrant find mr faulkner dead 
think gentlemen chief constable said quietly heard tell withdraw warrant altogether 
eh mean say henderson think young fellow fire shot would give hundred pounds could think faulkner deposition us see possible doubt matter 
besides present gave though may colored good deal feeling young wyatt convinced believed rate speaking truth 
doubt sir doubt mr wyatt guilt indeed brother pointed one important fact nothing would persuaded fire shot 
say conclusive sufficed show matter means certain seemed 
found house went arrest brother 
course young fellow greatly shocked told nature charge declared absolutely impossible 
certain even told nature mr faulkner depositions puzzled alarmed 
first question asked whether mr faulkner killed shot ball 
said ball face cleared altogether 
brother said know rabbit shooting mr merryweather would small shot young wyatt said think brother ever fired bullet life 
knew thing bullet house 
mr wyatt could possibly known likely meet mr faulkner way back shooting therefore unless upon rather improbable theory went intention shooting mr faulkner whenever met bought bullet town carried always purpose clear could fired shot 
something mr henderson 
good deal ready admit nothing would really counteract effect faulkner direct testimony given knew dying 
sir still point entirely overlooked however important 
tell taken place morning 
related story discovery tracks proved julian gone near tree behind murderer time standing running finding mr faulkner body set pursuit scoundrel 
two constables outside colonel like question sure confirm statement respects 
glad indeed hear story mr henderson colonel chambers said warmly 
lad father old friend mine terrible think son could committed dastardly crime 
say seems quite conclusive innocence time way contradiction deposition 
give great credit manner unravelled mystery 
credit sir entirely due mr wyatt brother 
formed theory opinion brother certainly innocent crime possible way could account absence home night upon hearing gun fired close hand mr wyatt run spot found body mr faulkner immediately started pursuit murderer 
setting search theory strongly fixed mind young wyatt seized every point confirmed pointed man heavy boots crossed fields run followed soon came upon footprints searching edge wood 
got clue follow matter plain enough 
search wood showed us whole circumstances case related plainly witnessed affair 
set upon right trail say honestly doubt whether unravelled especially snow rapidly going afternoon footprints disappeared 
well matter form take statement mr henderson take constables 
young mr wyatt outside would like hear sir 
certainly colonel said 
must wonderfully shrewd young fellow think ought take statement record part played proving brother innocence 
brother mr henderson come back yet sir regard absence alarming 
see murderer whoever armed rifle rate gun carried bullets mr wyatt shot gun 
fellow would certainly suffer arrested without struggle found followed across hills would likely enough shoot pursuer without letting get close enough use fowling piece 
sent two constables inquire coast guard men along cliffs whether observed man gun crossing hills yesterday afternoon whether heard gun fired 
soon statements constables morning intend take two others start search hills much afraid shall come upon mr wyatt body 
sincerely hope colonel chambers said see way accounting absence 
well call clerk take statement 
think harrington seems got four statements shall fully justified withdrawing warrant young wyatt 
quite think colonel 
see facts come coroner inquest think good deal strong feeling place found young wyatt killed bravely trying capture faulkner murderer time warrant apprehension murder still force 
yes good deal harrington 
faulkner died think would best merely hold warrant order wyatt comes back ever come back facts might proved publicly done coroner 
statements mr henderson two constables taken 
frank called 
congratulate heartily upon innocence brother minds conclusively proved mr henderson tells us chiefly owing shrewdness matter 
begin repeat opinion bullet pointed chief constable last night order point may included statement 
tell us story search wood 
frank finished colonel chambers said awkward thing brother disappearance 
giving fullest credit courage following desperate man armed rifle certainly rash undertaking fear may come harm 
suppose started much idea capturing man julian mind seeing 
brother come back statement man unknown shot mr faulkner story might credited 
certainly teeth mr faulkner depositions would believed evidence support 
still suppose even entered julian mind suspicion could possibly fall upon 
greatly afraid killed badly hurt see one possible way accounting absence 
mr faulkner extremely active pursuit smugglers know received many threatening letters 
man smuggler seems likely may gone place comrades awaiting julian pursuing may seized made prisoner 
see sir knew many affair day probably regarded friend may hold keeping man fired shot get safely reach 
hope may prove indeed magistrate said 
rate possible 
detain longer mr henderson told going accompany search among hills 
see beginning snow fear add difficulties 
days active search maintained trace discovered julian wyatt man followed 
inquiries instituted town chief constable learned man markham weeks returned serving sentence poaching mr faulkner preserves disappeared lodgings day murder returned 
known uttered many threats magistrate warrant issued arrest day coroner jury heard whole evidence brought verdict mr faulkner wilfully murdered person persons unknown 
chapter vi commission week coroner inquest servant one evening brought letter left door man looked like fisherman 
frank gave shout joy glanced address 
julian handwriting aunt shouted exclaimed mrs troutbeck sofa gave low cry fell back fainting ass blurt like rang bell vigor brought rope 
mary exclaimed servant appeared door scared face aunt fainted 
run round doctor directly must look letter first 
mr julian 
lor sir good news girl exclaimed hurried across mistress 
custom class hitherto looked upon matter darkest possible light joined general conviction julian killed 
julian letter written board smuggler 
dear frank afraid must horrible fright wonder 
unfortunate fellow seem always putting foot yet really think blame 
first place may tell board french smuggler entered loire hours shall nantes 
smugglers bring letter back england say shall probably sail days get hope long comes hand 
got 
julian related story quarrel mr faulkner hearing gun fired running finding body pursuit murderer 
long tramp hills took place hiding 
bound oath afford clue place say upon following pounced upon french smugglers trussed like fowl 
discussion man following joined 
course understand language could see smugglers favor cutting throat discovered hiding place man contrary expected arguing favor 
smuggler well poacher although murdered mr faulkner knew pursued crime undoubtedly saved life 
first made take oath reveal hiding place said carry france would take steps return england years 
steps say feel sure way prevent coming back long time 
keep may hand prisoner french authorities 
sailed man told learned warrant murder faulkner faulkner declared shot 
could possibly escaped would come back stand trial though see plainly enough might go hard would word would go nothing faulkner accusation fact quarrel 
however would come rather disappear awful charge 
man given permission write tell story even give name joseph markham 
short time prison sent poaching killed faulkner simply revenge 
told mind getting name first place idea returning weymouth intended making france home second place although might believe story one else would even showed weymouth letter written man accused murder would accepted moment 
however doubt fellow behaved extremely well sorry get trouble business faulkner affair mine 
course show letter like expect anyone except aunt believe 
hopes cleared day markham promised write full confession shooting faulkner swear french magistrate 
going write duplicate carry one copy directed colonel chambers senior magistrate weymouth send copy someone home produce case death france drowning sea 
think get away shall return england hear death 
awfully sorry old fellow aunt 
frightful accusation hanging think position would better come back hung murder see case strong would almost certainly come laid hands 
specially sorry trouble come upon going try get commission course could hardly give one fellow whose brother accused murder position army would intolerable 
good bye dear old frank give fond love aunt always good 
get opportunity write hardly fancy shall get chance even free write see letters sent france except smugglers 
god bless old fellow 
unfortunate brother julian 
happily time finished reading letter servant succeeded restoring mrs troutbeck 
exactly thought aunt 
julian seized smugglers taken france afraid time gets back especially believes charge hanging 
read letter morrow strong enough shall read 
must take first thing morning colonel chambers sure glad hear julian safe know thinks shot man pursued 
interested mr henderson seeing exactly right conclusions arrived 
mrs troutbeck quite satisfied explanation taken bed servant frank seeing yet eight clock put cap ran mr henderson latter home received great pleasure news julian alive 
read letter attentively 
seen whole thing happen could closer conclusion came 
well news markham shot mr faulkner surprise know already warrant charge 
fear little chance shall lay hands doubtless learn associates evidence given coroner inquest brother proved altogether innocent crime 
understand believing evidence mr wyatt overwhelming great objection giving name matter stood brother story would regarded attempt guilty man fix blame crime another 
turned letter piece important evidence might produced markham statements tally facts discovered 
still congratulate heartily 
certainly thought brother murdered though efforts find traces crime failed altogether 
afraid says long time manages get away still comparatively unimportant matter hope fellow markham come speedy end 
course show letter everyone nobody believes moment brother mr faulkner murderer everyone glad hear mystery cleared simply france instead supposed buried hole body would never discovered 
possibly said behaved rashly following desperate man instead coming back us assistance quite see circumstance relations magistrate doubly anxious bring latter murderer justice know latter would certainly got away unsuspected brother acted 
colonel chambers equally pleased frank called upon next morning begged showing letter friends hand safe keeping event markham ever arrested would valuable evidence affording assistance prosecution 
think colonel chambers able keep julian away long time supposition correct one intend hand french authorities prisoner war may long time hear 
many towns france english prisoners confined would practically impossible find obtain release find two nations war 
exchanges made chances among would small 
however lad things might great deal worse 
tremendous war go ever 
brother strong healthy seems hear sort fellow would take things easily although lot prisoners war whether england france called pleasant one fairer chance going unharmed 
experience may benefit 
course matter first began made close enquiries several quarters character habits 
need say heard nothing whatever sort consensus opinion pity pursuit occupation 
know mixed extent smugglers spent evenings frequently billiard rooms altogether though nothing absolutely clear good 
given billiard table frank said 
promised would go sure glad hear lad still think experience good rather harm 
kindly good tempered easy going young fellow little deficient perhaps strength generally liked making fine man yet likely sheer easiness temper disinclination settle anything drift stream till ruined life 
read character heard think complete break life may ultimately considerable benefit 
perhaps sir 
better brother never lived may ready fall people views 
think great pity apply commission army 
great pity colonel chambers agreed 
young fellow start pursuit desperate man armed gun would sort fellow lead forlorn hope 
going frank going try get commission sir julian completely cleared

chapter x smolensk julian regiment arrived konigsberg early march found form part ney division 
whole country round turned enormous camp every town center round great array tents clustered 
troops many nationalities french poles bavarians saxons prussians austrians even spanish 
never since hordes attila swept europe vast army gathered 
total force collected invasion russia amounted men infantry cavalry remainder artillery engineers 
guns 
april passed without movement 
troops became impatient even veterans whose confidence napoleon implicit shook heads 
ought across frontier old sergeant julian company said smoked pipe together two mugs german beer 
think much fighting russia army say alexander busy since peace tilsit time could scarce place men field 
one fears russians big country say winter cold horrible 
shall long distances march know much time always wasted making treaty peace 
back winter ought 
course emperor may mean hold st petersburg moscow next spring daresay could make comfortable enough either place come winter six hundred fifty thousand men couple hundred thousand horses tremendous job think emperor would send riff raff spaniards germans poles back keep french garrison winter 
still would much rather back first snow falls 
like long campaigns 
men ready fight fight twenty times need like done 
long campaign marches halts delays discipline gets slack men begin grumble besides clothes wear however big stores take sure run short time 
wish 
th may napoleon arrived dresden met emperor empress austria kings prussia saxony host archdukes princes fortnight spent brilliant f tes 
napoleon means blind magnitude enterprise embarked entertained hopes army would recross frontier winter 
indeed leaving paris predicted three campaigns would necessary lasting terms peace could secured 
thus early commencement campaign comparatively slight importance indeed preparations struggle great scale could energy displayed pushing forward completed end june 
thus napoleon delayed paris feasted dresden roads germany occupied great hosts men enormous trains baggage waggons descriptions moving steadily towards russian frontier 
th june napoleon arrived konigsberg 
ney division marched forward fortnight emperor route konigsberg frontier reviewed division davoust oudinot also two great cavalry divisions 
oppose threatening storm alexander gathered three armies 
first stationed round wilna general barclay de tolly comprised men second posted wolkowich commanded prince bagration numbered third headquarters lutsk commanded count tormanssow reserve widely scattered contained men 
thus total force gathered oppose advance napoleon army 
disadvantage scattered impossible foresee several roads open napoleon would advance whether intended make st petersburg moscow 
next days divisions intended form advance moved towards niemen marked frontier th june three bridges thrown across river near kovno passage began 
french cavalry drove cossacks watching passage evening emperor established headquarters kovno corps davoust oudinot ney crossed bridges cavalry murat composing altogether force men marched forward rapid pace th wilna seventy five miles distant 
days napoleon crossed frontier russians obtained definite information force advancing commander chief saw would hopeless attempt oppose large body 
great mistake committed occupying position near frontier necessity retreat became evident time lost carrying effect orders despatched commanders various armies fall back speed 
thus although french accomplished wonderful feat marching seventy eight miles two days done hope falling upon russians time concentrate found town already evacuated whole immense magazines collected destroyed 
almost simultaneously passage niemen three corps french marshals prince eugene generals also crossed south also advanced full speed hopes interposing three russian armies preventing concentration 
next week french pressed hard upon rear retreating russians failed bring battle suffered incessant downpor rain made roads well nigh impassable 
commissariat train broke hundred pieces cannon ammunition waggons abandoned 
rain bitterly cold wind accompanied brought epidemic among horses forced depend solely upon green rye growing fields 
several thousands died troops suffered much thirst hunger less stragglers fell ranks spread country burning ravaging plundering committing terrible depredations 
dismay caused treatment villages abandoned whole population retired advance french driving flocks herds thus adding greatly difficulties invaders 
illustration map showing route napoleon march moscow 
greater portion straggling marauders belonged french corps allies possessed none discipline french soldiery whose conduct throughout campaign largely responsible intense animosity excited invaders suffering afterwards befell 
pursuit continued even napoleon best soldiers surprised failure overtake russians 
however long marches however well planned operations russians always marched manoeuvred 
seemed almost pursuing phantom army wisp eluded efforts grasp fierce fight rear guard barclay de tolly army advance guard murat cavalry latter suffered severely fight importance invaders marching half way moscow arrived witebsk 
nevertheless suffered severely 
savage ferocity spite repeated proclamations orders invading army treated people exasperated peasantry almost madness taking arms cut every straggler annihilated small parties attacked baggage trains repeated russia terrible retaliation dealt spanish guerillas upon invaders 
right french advance heavier fighting 
general schwarzenberg austrians advanced third russian army tormanssow 
brigade division regnier napoleon order marching join schwarzenberg entered kobrin surrounded tormanssow brave resistance nine hours lost killed wounded remainder number forced surrender 
tormanssow took strong position men awaited attack united forces schwarzenberg regnier strong

obstinate resistance however given russians attacks rear guard impressed invaders respect foes strong contrast feeling entertained crossed frontier save among soldiers met russians knew dogged valor always fought especially defensive 
going tough work jules tell one said julian whose english birth almost forgotten good temper always manifested however long marches however great fatigues become general favorite 
guess going fight russians tired retreating tired pursuing 
gain nothing fighting 
outnumber tremendously 
great bulk army lies heights side river nothing prevent retreating strong position might give battle advantage 
hand reason fight 
come thirty forty miles direct road moscow instead crossed river gone straight russians must evacuated town pushed speed order get us moscow 
marching without getting battle discourages men even defeat hope something restore discipline among germans austrians ay among troops 
number campaigns never seen disorder plunder want discipline shown since entered russia 
tell jules even defeat would us good 
look russians never leave straggler behind never dismounted gun roads behind us choked abandoned guns waggons whole country covered marauders

true enough bad best lad

napoleon would soon put stop

loubino cost although numbers small proportion total strength army exclusively french soldiers belonging divisions placed main trust 
question whether establish winter country occupied accumulate stores make smolensk great dep would serve base advance spring move moscow 
point held council marshals 
opinion generally favourable former course 
desperate fighting three previous days opened eyes fact even great force led napoleon could afford despise russians 
country present occupied rich 
many towns army could go comfortable quarters winter communications frontier open safe 
unquestionably safer prudent course 
conclusions napoleon agreed theory 
originally intention winter provinces overrun march st petersburg moscow spring 
however matters besides military expediency consider 
first place poles exasperated refusal establish ancient kingdom refusal necessitated fact could without taking austria prussia allies polish districts fallen share 
poles felt terrible pressure supporting army still poland contributing vast expenses war campaign continue long attitude might change one open hostility 
next place conclusion peace brought efforts england sweden turkey russia would enable latter bring whole forces engaged south turks north watching swedish frontier would give time new levies converted good soldiers placed field 
matters going badly spain 
could place little dependence upon austria prussia germany 
absent another year france might find countries leagued 
therefore although recognizing justice arguments marshals decided upon pushing moscow establishing winter 
even yet recognize stubbornness constancy russian character believed spectacle ancient capital hands would induce treat peace 
decision welcome army 
general wish soldiers get matter home 
obstinacy russians fought rapidity marched intense animosity excited among peasants cruel treatment exposed recklessness threw away lives could take vengeance sufferings ferocity every straggler small detachment fell hands massacred things combined excite feeling gloom anxiety among soldiers 
merry songs round bivouac fires even thought plunder moscow failed raise spirits

smolensk like moscow considered sacred city soldiers affected rather impiety act actual destruction wrought 
general wilson frank rode back spot general barclay stationed mass russian infantry moved hill towards bridges began cross 
whose division sir robert asked officer joined staff 
prince eugene replied 
pressing us hard driven doctorow men covered way massing assault one gates 
fire continued unabated seven clock 
messenger came across news french drawing covered way reoccupied 
general wilson warmly thanked russian commander chief silenced batteries threatened bridges 
evening issued order evacuation smolensk disaffection barclay de tolly broke renewed force night body generals came sir robert wilson tent 
time occupied dictating despatch frank requested retire directly saw rank visitors 
soon alone said resolved send emperor request army new chief declaration name troops order came st petersburg suspend hostilities greet invaders friends along believed retrograde movements result advice minister count romanzow order would regarded one express imperial majesty real sentiments wishes extracted majesty false representations external control army would continue maintain pledge pursue contest till invader driven beyond frontier 
general wilson one generals said beg undertake delivery message emperor 
would mean death russian officer undertook commission knowing attachment emperor equally well known feelings towards person well qualified lay expression sentiments 
motives suspected coming emperor self respect would suffer way would message conveyed one subjects 
one another generals urged request 
sir robert listened arguments said altogether grave matter decide upon hastily 
know thoroughly well thought disloyalty mind towards emperor act one gravest insubordination indeed threat disobey majesty commands event ordering suspension hostilities 
conduct commander chief competent express opinion whatever soldier understand long continued retreat abandonment many provinces enemy without striking single blow defense trying extreme brave soldiers 
shall leave army see fairly march start give reply 
generals thanked sir robert warmly withdrew 
shall write night wyatt general said frank entered tent 
grave matters think 
best lie get hours sleep 
morrow likely eventful day operation withdrawing army position getting main road full peril may indeed end terrible disaster 
soon russian army repulsed attacks french resumed march towards moscow sir robert wilson left proceeded st petersburg promised russian generals inform czar opinion disposition army dissatisfaction general determination continue combat refuse recognize negotiations armistice might made enemy 
shall leave wyatt general said morning desperate defense loubino saved army 
little chance french pressing russians 
think probable may go winter quarters case hope outmarch us follow battle position russians may choose 
even fighting imminent still start day st petersburg came round smolensk know thought emperor would found 
first duty see report arrangements made danube grand vizier people whole russian army able join defense french 
soon done explained majesty position shall rejoin hope czar also coming presence would useful military way men world could fight better russians army fears things peace made opportunity wiping considers disgrace allowing french overrun many rich provinces without striking blow 
point fact defense smolensk way men yesterday withstood hours assault three four times number would sufficient prove world fighting qualities 
mind consider barclay acted wisely declining hazard whole fortune war upon single battle enemy first outnumbered nearly threefold never taken position frontier mean defend 
army would become disorganized rabble long ago 
nothing trying troops march weeks hotly chased enemy 
three times peninsula seen british army becomes far less trying circumstances 
russians know retreat admirable manner maintained discipline creditable winning great victory would still one understand sight flying population deserted fields surrender provinces enemy mortifying highest degree pride 
nevertheless barclay policy though think carried great deal far troops fight yesterday might fought dozen battles like loubino would compelled french advance slowly instead hot pursuit justified great extent 
hear invading army already suffered great losses fever hardship effect weather number stragglers cut killed peasantry 
transport especially suffered vast numbers horses died campaign like transport everything 
various fights taken place since entered russia probably suffered heavier loss russians latter always fought defensive french loss fallen napoleon best troops russian army equally good 
lastly although russians discontented continued retreat morale seem suffered way probable long marches inability bring general engagement distance home uncertainty future told heavily upon french vastly susceptible matters kind russians 
remain headquarter staff wish away obtain accurate details movements various columns write full report every evening march matters interest 
want forward keep future reference 
hope rejoin fighting takes place

english though fought half dozen times since beaten always liking 
one reason took youngster first 
fight well one sergeants asked 
never spain thought bulletins generally beat 
bulletins growled rignold believe bulletins got accustomed writing bulletins victory get thrashed write strain 
tell fought conquered italy austria prussia rhine learned acknowledge among even best troops none good came fighting english 
fought dozen battles one could honestly say got best 
talavera nearest thing 
fairly thrashed busaco salamanca 
albuera claimed drawn fight drawn fight never wish share 
day going well 
spaniards course bolted horse foot 
last matters cleared advanced heavy columns 
soult called reserves 
captured six guns 
columns crowned hill held cheered loudly believing battle english brigade line fell upon us 
guns swept grape terribly time fell confusion 
astonishment rallied came us 
four one columns strove vain form line meet 
volley volley swept away head formation 
soult exposed recklessly 
officers men ran forward kept fire seemed must destroy yet came cheering incessantly 
never see thing 
never man see thing 
came upon us bayonet 
strove fought like madmen vain hurled hill utter confusion 
heard afterwards british soldiers began day stood unwounded end 
spaniards course never counted anything allies harm good throwing confusion flight 
infantry veteran troops mind yet could storm hill drive englishmen 
lost men battle lasted four hours 
regiment suffered reduced third number 
fought salamanca got thrashed soon sent back france fill ranks one glad indeed sent rhine back spain tell never want meet english battle 
borodino bad enough stubborn hard fighting russians proved tough customers one want meet english dash quickness 
maneuver much rapidly russians charge either got destroy go 
right comrade another said 
regiment th badajoz 
strong place 
phillipson command thoroughly good officer 
strengthened defences every way garrison strong 
reckoned could hold three months anyhow 
men sat us th march began open trenches strong outlying fort 
made several sorties could hinder th stormed fort 
defended desperately hour 
still outlying work 
soult known advancing relief waited gather large force possible believing reasonably enough could hold month still calculated holding three 
english worked like demons th april made two breaches 
prepared everything 
planted mines breaches 
scores powder barrels hundreds shells ready roll 
guns placed sweep flanks along top 
stockade massive beams fixed sword blades front breach covered loose planks studded sharp iron points 
every man behind stockade half dozen spare muskets 
legion devils could taken place 
take never mortal men try harder 
even felt absolutely impossible stood amid storm shot shell exploding powder barrels bursting mines 
two thousand men killed breach yet still stood 
triumph short one another british division carried castle 
exulting victory town lost 
thus see twenty days captured fortress everyone else made sure could defend least three months 
fortunately exchanged short time afterwards escaped sent english prison 
agree rignold 
ready share fighting would rather one even russians english think find every man served spain would say 
comrades another veteran said seems make much difference got fight see generals make things even 
one generals finds say spaniards marching force gives battle 
well give battle austrians unless got something like 
say borodino would like least russians 
doubt english calculate way spain must admit always found ready fight far numbers went outmatched 
take difference fighting powers armies felt much would think soldier allowance made generals sides soldiers find always handicapped proportion fighting powers 
see big element luck 
question ground comes climate 
taking spain though would fair enough odds fight open hundred us attacked spaniards among mountains would go hard us 
though frenchmen might repulse mamelukes attacked us cool morning evening yet caught middle day sun blazing parched thirst might succumb 
course question generals counts great deal 
see even supposing sides agree fighting powers troops element luck counts lot begin fight never feel sure going win 
well win almost everywhere brison 
yes yes napoleon ney soult rest 
fight hard many many time battle fought armies change generals things would gone quite differently 
napoleon egypt julian asked

five minutes later grenadiers rhone six regiments division marched moscow extinguish flames 
chapter xiii rear guard napoleon yet idea fires accidental next morning removed headquarters imperial palace kremlin fondly hoped dictate terms peace russia 
long truth became evident 
every hour fresh fires broke spreading rapidly nightfall whole city flames 
following day kremlin became uninhabitable heat emperor forced withdraw could return till th heavy rain extinguished flames already consumed nine tenths city 
houses escaped churches destroyed damaged wounded french russians hospitals perished flames 
meantime kutusow tardily adopted advice rejected moved round army taken position oka river near kulouga menaced french line communication 
already cossack cavalry hovering round moscow intercepting convoys cutting small detachments horses french cavalry worn fatigue famine several affairs russian cavalry latter gained decisive advantages 
right comrade old sergeant said julian promoted rank sergeant battle borodino stood together night th gazing terrible spectacle city enveloped flames 
peste russians terrible fellows 
could thought thing bad look us 
terrible look denying julian agreed 
impossible army stay without food without forage without shelter communications threatened russian army flank 
see nothing retreat sooner better 
emperor would issue orders march begin daylight 
another month winter us none say disasters may befall army 
order given day french army might made way back frontier heavy loss doubtless without disaster 
napoleon could bring believe russians would refuse enter negotiations 
tried various sources send proposals alexander even opened secret negotiations kutusow arranged private meeting matter stopped sir robert wilson received specific instructions emperor alexander interpose name prevent negotiations whatever carried 
thus week week precious time passed portion army moved russians 
several engagements took place advantage generally resting russians especially engagement murat suffered decisive repulse 
julian soon fire moscow burnt employed endeavoring buy warm garments 
money plentiful means spending since entered russia fortunate able buy warm tinder garments looted plunderers night first arrival moscow 
also purchased peasant sheep skin caftan hood sewed military cloak form lining hood time turned inside 
another sheep skin manufactured couple bags used mittens without fingers thumbs 
many comrades laughed work days grew colder endeavored follow example skins sheep brought occasionally cavalry eagerly bought 
encouraged success julian next manufactured pair sheep skin leggings wool inside 
sewn bottom could worn boots 
shape left much desired cutting blanket made two long bands three inches wide twenty feet long 
intended wrap tightly round leggings use 
leggings gloves bands stowed away knapsack almost everything else discarded make room felt sure would inspection kits frontier crossed 
still napoleon could bring issue general order retreat corps corps moved along western road 
mortier division remained last moscow marched rd october napoleon orders blown kremlin church st nicholas adjoining buildings 
safest line retreat would witebsk napoleon took southern road army believed intended fight another great battle russians 
weather first fine 
th vanguard viceroy came contact doctorow division fierce fight took place near malo jaroslavets 
french checked kutusow coming main army apparent french vanguard could overwhelmed napoleon retreat brought standstill 
generals expecting order attack kutusow whose previous conduct entering secret negotiations napoleon excited strong suspicions good faith announced changed mind ordered russian army draw thus time saving french complete disaster 
battle however sanguinary one less ten thousand killed side 
retirement russians retreat continued 
davoust commanded advance ney division cover rear 
french army first moved slowly th napoleon reached borodino 
long ill health bodily pain sapped energy 
long time unable sit horse traveled close carriage 
consequently seemed lost time energy quickness decision five weeks thrown away moscow another wasted slow movements haste greatest importance 
french suffered disadvantage every movement discovered reported ubiquitous cossacks absolute ignorance strength movements enemy 
th november bitter frost set soldiers awoke chilled bone gloomy anticipations would happen full rigor russian winter upon 
respects frost advantage hardened roads often almost impassable amount heavy traffic passed
