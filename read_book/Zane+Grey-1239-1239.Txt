braves carried away gaudy feathers trailing long arms hanging inertly face distorted agony 
maidens tribe however showed prisoner interest something veiled sympathy 
indian girls always fascinated white men

chapter xiv 
many miles village peace rose irregular chain hills first faint indications grand appalachian mountain system 
ridges thickly wooded white oak poplar hickory among sentinel pine reared evergreen head 
clefts hills passes lined gray stoned cliffs ran clear brooks tumbling rocks hurry meet majestic father ohio 
one valleys narrow sun seldom brightened merry brook made deep cut rocks 
head valley tapered walls nearly met seemed lose shade fern faced cliffs shadowed fir trees leaning brink though search secrets ravine 
deep dark cool sequestered nook late summer dislodged early spring 
everywhere soft fresh bright green 
old gray cliffs festooned ferns lichens moss 
great shelving rock damp stained copper colored water dripping side dewy dell sunshine never peeped 
swift brook tarried lovingly making wide turn cliff though loth leave quiet nook leaped enthusiasm murmuring flight 
life abounded wild beautiful almost inaccessible spot 
little brown yellow birds flitted among trees thrushes ran along leaf strewn ground orioles sang melancholy notes robins flickers darted beneath spreading branches 
squirrels scurried leaves like little whirlwinds leaped daringly swinging branches barked noisily woody perches 
rabbits hopped inquisitively nibbling tender shoots sassafras laurel 
along flower skirted stream tall young man carrying rifle cautiously stepped peering branches overhead 
gray flash shot along limb white oak bushy tail squirrel flitted well protected notch whence doubt keen little eye watched hunter every movement 
rifle raised lowered 
hunter walked around tree 
presently tree top snug knotty limb spied little ball gray fur 
grasping branch underbush shook vigorously 
thrashing sound worried gray squirrel slipped retreat stuck nose limb 
crack scratching tearing bark squirrel loosened hold fell alighting thump 
hunter picked quarry streak sunshine glinting tree top brightened face 
hunter joe 
satisfied stowing squirrel pocket hunting coat shouldered rifle went back ravine 
presently dull roar sounded babble brook 
grew louder threaded way carefully stones 
spots white foam flecked brook 
passing gray stained cliff joe turned around rocky corner came abrupt end ravine 
waterfall marked spot brook entered 
water brown took leap light green thinned dashed stones became beautiful sheeny white 
upon flat rock near cascade spray flew sat another hunter 
roaring falls drowned sounds yet man roused dreamy contemplation waterfall joe rounded corner 
heerd four shots said joe came 
yes got squirrel every shot 
wetzel led way along narrow foot trail gradually wound toward top ravine 
path emerged presently distance falls brink bluff 
ran along edge precipice yards took course back densely wooded thickets 
stepping open cliff wetzel paused peered keenly sides 
living thing seen silence deep unbroken calm wilderness 
wetzel stepped bluff looked 
stony wall opposite thirty feet away somewhat lower 
wetzel action appeared intended leap fissure 
truth many band indians pursuing hunter rocky fastness come bluff marveling thought wetzel prowess believed made wonderful leap thus eluding 
never attempted leap first knew well nigh impossible secondly never necessity risk 
one leaning cliff would observed perhaps ten feet narrow ledge projecting face rock 
would imagined drop ledge would way get would worse predicament 
without moment hesitation wetzel swung ledge 
joe followed suit 
one end lower ledge grew hardy shrub ironwood species scrub pine leaned horizontally ravine 
laying rifle wetzel grasped strong root cautiously slid side 
body disappeared exception sinewy fingers loosened hold root grasped rifle dragged sight 
quietly similar caution joe took hold root let full length swung ledge 
feet found pocket cliff 
letting go root took rifle another second safe 
wetzel retreats many considered one safest 
cavern ledge discovered accident 
one day hotly pursued shawnees headed cliff let ledge intending drop tops trees 
taking advantage every little aid hung means shrub act leaping saw cliff shelved ledge within reach feet entrance cavern 
found cave small opening back split rock 
evidently place entered rear bears used hole winter sleeping quarters 
crawling hands knees wetzel found rear opening 
thus established hiding place almost impossible locate 
provisioned retreat always entered cliff left rear 
evidence wetzel strange nature love wild home manifested bound joe secrecy 
unlikely even young man ever get safely wilderness stories might relate would reveal hunter favorite rendezvous 
wetzel seriously demanded secrecy earnestly forest full indians white men prowling search burrow 
joe seventh heaven delight took free life wild gosling takes water 
place ever appealed dark silent hole far side steep cliff 
interest wetzel soon passed great admiration deepened love 
afternoon satisfied well within refuge joe laid aside rifle whistling softly began prepare supper 
back part cave permitted stand erect large enough comparative comfort 
neat little stone fireplace several cooking utensils gourds 
time time wetzel brought things 
pile wood bundle pine cones lay one corner 
haunches dried beef bear buffalo meat hung pegs bag parched corn another dried apples lay rocky shelf 
nearby hung powder horn filled salt pepper 
cleft back cave spring clear cold water 
wants woodsmen simple 
joe wetzel appetites whetted stirring outdoor life relished frugal fare could never enjoyed feast 
shadows evening entered cave lighted pipes partake hunter sweetest solace quiet smoke 
strange may appear lonely stern indian hunter reckless impulsive boy admirably suited companionship 
wetzel taken liking young man led brothers fort henry 
subsequent events strengthened liking many days joe followed forest strong attachment insensibly forged 
wetzel understood joe burning desire roam forests half expected lad would soon grow tired roving life exactly opposite symptoms displayed 
hunter intended take comrade hunting trip return fort henry 
woods weeks every day way joe showed mettle 
wetzel finally admitted secrets cherished hiding place 
want hurt lad feelings taking back settlement could send back 
days wore swiftly full heart satisfying incident life man boy growing closer intimacy warm unusual 
two reasons might account first sane human better companionship 
exile would find something happiness one shared misery 
secondly joe acceptable comrade even slayer indians 
wedded wetzel forest trails lonely life nemesis pursuit followed eighteen long years still white man kind gentle quiet hours though knew still capable affection 
never known youth manhood one pitiless warfare sworn foes years sore cold heart warmed toward woman 
life held one purpose bloody one 
yet man heart could prevent responding another 
simple ignorance rebelled affection anything forest homes 
man weak hate avail love dark caverns wetzel great heart opened admitting gloomy depths stranger 
new love born cheerless heart long lonely inmate ghost old love dwelt chill seclusion 
feeling comradeship wetzel joe something altogether new hunter life 
true hunted jonathan zane accompanied expeditions forced sleep another scout companion say friend never known 
joe boy wilder eagle yet man 
happy enthusiastic still good spirits never jarred hunter restrained 
never asked questions would seem case eager lad waited spoken 
apt never forgot anything eye born woodsman lastly perhaps went far wetzel strong supple young lynx absolutely fearless 
evening wetzel joe followed usual custom smoked lying sleep 
tonight hunter even silent usual lad tired day tramp lay bed fragrant boughs 
wetzel sat gathering gloom pulled slowly pipe 
evening quiet birds ceased twittering wind died away early bay wolf wail panther hoot owl simply perfect silence 
lad deep even breathing caught wetzel ear found meditating often late new something crept life 
joe loved could fail see 
lad preferred roam lonely indian hunter forests encounter perils hardships wild life rather accept smile fortune love 
wetzel knew colonel zane taken liking boy offered work home also hunter remembered warm light seen nell hazel eyes 
musing thus man felt stir heart emotion long absent unfamiliar 
avenger forgot moment brooding plans 
felt strangely softened 
laid head rude pillow sense gladness although always desired lonely life wanted pass fulfillment vow loneliness shared lad loved 
joe awakened merry chirp chipmunk every morning ran along seamy side opposite wall gorge 
getting went back cave found wetzel combing long hair 
lad thrust hands cold pool bathed face 
water icy cold sent invigorating thrill 
laughed took rude comb wetzel handed 
scalp nothing make indian covetous said eyeing admiration magnificent black hair fell hunter shoulders 
grow answered wetzel 
joe wonder care wetzel took hair misunderstand hunter simple pride 
wetzel careful rifle neat clean person brushed buckskin costume polished knife tomahawk hair received attention else 
required much care 
combed reached fully knees 
joe seen returned long hunt work patiently hour wooden comb stop every little burr gone tangle smoothed 
would comb morning course time permitted twist tie offer small resistance slipping underbush 
joe knew hunter simplicity cut hair would seem feared indians streaming black hair indians long coveted sworn take 
would make brave famous chief theme many savage war tale 
breakfast wetzel said joe stay look round mebbe come back soon go kill buffalo 
injuns sometimes foller buffalo trail want sure none varlets chasin herd saw day 
wetzel left cave rear 
took fifteen minutes crawl head tortuous stony passage 
lifting stone closed aperture looked listened 
rising replaced stone passed wooded hillside 
beautiful morning dew glistened green leaves sun shone bright warm birds warbled trees 
hunter moccasins pressed gently moss leaves made sound soft foot panther 
trained ear alert catch unfamiliar noise keen eyes sought first remoter open glades glens bent gaze mossy bluff beneath feet 
fox squirrels dashed bushy retreats grouse whirred away thickets startled deer whistled loped white flags upraised 
wetzel knew action denizens woods creature native haunts disturbed morning 
otherwise deer would grazing lying low close thicket fox squirrels seldom never disturbed hunter twice one day frightened little animals wilder shyer gray squirrels remained hidden hours grouse flushed little always get unusually quick fly far alighting 
wetzel circled back hill took long survey rocky eminence reconnoitered lowland several miles 
located herd buffalo satisfying indians near bison grazing quietly returned cave 
soft whistle back door rocky home told joe hunter waiting 
coast clear whispered lad thrusting head entrance 
gray eyes gleamed brightly showing eager spirit 
hunter nodded throwing rifle hollow arm proceeded hill 
joe followed closely endeavoring wetzel trained make step precisely hunter footprints 
lad soon learned step nimbly softly cat 
half way bill wetzel paused 
see anythin whispered 
joe glanced sides 
many mistakes taught cautious 
learned experience every woodland creature saw ten watching every move 
could see even little red squirrel 
everywhere sturdy hickory oak trees thickets hazelnuts slender ash saplings open glades patches sumach 
rotting trees lay ground ferns nodded long slender heads fallen monarchs 
joe could make nothing colors woods gray tree trunks openings forest green dead purple haze forests farther 
smiled shaking head hunter action admitted failure 
try 
dead ahead whispered wetzel 
joe bent direct gaze clump sassafras one hundred feet ahead 
searched open places shadows even branches 
turned eyes slowly right 
whatever discernible human vision studied intently 
suddenly eye became fixed small object protruding behind beech tree 
pointed color darker gray bark beech 
easy matter pass little thing lad saw knew belonged 
buck ear replied 
hardly finished speaking wetzel intentionally snapped twig 
crash commotion thicket branches moved small saplings waved open glade bounded large buck whistle alarm 
throwing rifle level joe trying cover bounding deer hunter struck piece 
lad kill fer sake killin said quietly 
plenty venison 
go arter buffalo 
hev hankerin fer good rump steak 
half hour later hunters emerged forest wide plain waving grass 
kind oval valley encircled hills one time perhaps covered water 
joe saw herd large animals browsing like cattle meadow 
heart beat high moment buffalo seen stood river banks raft passed ohio 
would surely get shot one huge fellows 
wetzel bade joe exactly whereupon dropped hands knees began crawl long grass 
easy hunter bard lad accomplish 
still managed keep comrade sight matter congratulation man crawled fast walked 
length joe seemed long time hunter paused 
near enough whispered joe breathlessly 
nope

wetzel rose carefully peeped top grass dropping fours resumed advance 
paused presently waited joe come 
see young fellar remember never hurry unless bizness calls fer speed act like lightnin 
thus admonishing eager lad wetzel continued crawl

joe wondered wide shoulders got weeds grasses without breaking least shaking 

flat whispered wetzel putting broad hand joe back pressing 
yer time fer good practice 
trail yer rifle yer back yer careful slide reach far one arm dig yer fingers deep 
pull yerself forrard 
wetzel slipped grass like huge buckskin snake 
long lithe body wormed way among reeds 
joe even advantage hunter trail follow difficult work 
dry reeds broke stalks saw grass shook 
worked persistently learning improving every rod 
surprised hear swish followed dull blow ground 
raising head looked forward 
saw hunter wipe tomahawk grass 
snake whispered wetzel 
joe saw huge blacksnake squirming grass 
head severed 
caught glimpses snakes gliding away glossy round moles darting holes 
gray rabbit started leap 
near enough whispered wetzel stopping behind bush 
rose surveyed plain motioned joe look 
joe raised knees 
gaze reached level grassy plain heart leaped 
fifty yards away great shaggy black buffalo 
king herd ill ease pawed grass shook huge head 
near several cows half grown calf 
beyond main herd extending far joe could see great sea black humps lad breathed hard took grand sight 
pick little fellar reddish brown one plug behind shoulder

wetzel rare smile lighted dark face 
probably could shot fly horn bull one big flies bees plainly visible swirled around huge head alighted 
joe slowly raised rifle 
covered calf pull trigger sagacity far beyond experience hunter whispered wetzel fire may run toward us 
nope run away answered wetzel thinking lad keen indian 
joe quickly covered calf pulled trigger 
bellowing loud big bull dashed 
herd swung around toward west soon galloping lumbering roar 
shaggy humps bobbed like hot angry waves storm blackened sea 
upon going forward wetzel joe found calf lying dead grass 
might hev better n remarked hunter saw bullet struck 
went little fer back mebbe thet cause calf stepped shot 
chapter xv 
days passed swiftly dreamily one bringing joe keener delight 
single month good woodsman many pioneers passed years border advantage teacher whose woodcraft incomparable 
besides naturally quick learning interest centered upon forest lore wonder assimilated much wetzel knowledge 
ever willing undertake anything whereby might learn 
often miles away dense forest far cave asked wetzel let try lead way back camp 
never failed though many times got straight course thereby missing easy traveling 
joe wonderfully well lacked nearly white men subtler intuitive forest instinct makes indian much home woods teepee 
wetzel developed high degree 
born 
years training years passionate unrelenting search indians given knowledge wilds incomprehensible white men appalling red foes 
joe saw wetzel used ability really baffled 
realized words adequate explain fully great art 
possession required marvelously keen vision eye perfectly familiar every creature tree rock shrub thing belonging forest eye quick flight detect instantly slightest change nature anything unnatural environment 
hearing must delicate like deer finer keener woodsman 
lastly feeling prompts old hunter say game day 
something speaks sees night hawk circling low near ground says storm morrow 
makes indian home wilderness 
clouds may hide guiding star northing may lost may moss trees difference bark ridges may flat lost altogether may water courses yet indian brave always goes teepee straight crow flies 
voice rightly bade wetzel baffled indian trail fading among rocks cross circle advance direction taken wily foe 
joe practiced trailing deer hoofed game true hound 
began perfect art following human forest 
except old indian trails rain half obliterated tracks discover save wetzel hard find airy course grosbeak 
soft ground marshy grass wetzel avoided could left faint trail hard surface traces left might well gone ground 
joe persistence stood good stead hung failed harder tried 
often would slip cave wetzel gone try find way taken 
brief lad became fine marksman good hunter close persevering student wilderness 
loved woods contained 
learned habits wild creatures 
deer squirrel grouse killed taught lesson 
always lark watch sun rise red grand eastern hills chase away white mist valleys 
even hunting roaming woods necessary lie low camp awaiting wetzel return always content 
many hours idled away lying back west wind blowing softly eye distant hills cloud shadows swept across slow majestic movement like huge ships sea 
wetzel joe far distant cave often case made camp open woods joe contentment fullest 
twilight shades stealing camp fire cheery glow red embers crackling dry stocks sweet smell wood smoke lad subtle potent charm 
hunter would broil venison steak partridge coals 
would light pipes smoke twilight deepened 
oppressive stillness early evening hour always brought younger man sensation awe 
first attributed fact new life however days passed emotion remained nay grew stronger concluded imparted close communion nature 
deep solemn tranquil gloaming hour brought ordinary fullness joy clearness perception 
ever feel stillness asked wetzel one evening sat near flickering fire 
hunter puffed pipe like indian seemed let question take deep root 
scalped redskins every hour day ceptin twilight replied 
joe wondered longer whether hunter hardened feel beautiful tranquillity 
hour wooed wetzel implacable pursuit indeed bewitching one 
never time joe lay alone camp waiting wetzel hope hunter would return information indians 
man never talked savages spoke tell incident day travel 
one evening came back large black fox killed

next day wetzel told joe would go across country seek new game fields 
accordingly two set tramped industriously evening 
came upon country less beautiful one left though picturesque cliffs rugged hills given way rolling land luxuriance explained abundant springs streams 
forests fields thickly interspersed bubbling springs narrow deep streams small lake running outlet 
wetzel said little concerning region little enough rouse joe eagerness effect country much traversed indians especially runners hunting parties traveling north south 
hunter explained center tract ran buffalo road buffalo always picked straightest lowest dryest path one range another indians followed first pathfinders 
joe wetzel made camp bank stream night lad watched hunter build hidden camp fire peered furtively around half expecting see dark forms scurrying forest 
wetzel extremely cautious 
stripped pieces bark fallen trees built little hut firewood 
rubbed powder piece punk flint steel dropped two three sparks inflammable substance 
soon blaze 
arranged covering ray light escaped 
flames subsided wood burned glowing bed red threw aside bark broiled strips venison brought

chapter xvi 
waning moon rose high enough shed pale light forest field two dark figures moving silently shade trees crossed moonlit patches ground open plain low grass hung silver mists 
timber wolf gray gaunt came loping along lowered nose 
new scent brought animal standstill 
nose went fiery eyes scanned plain 
two men invaded domain short dismal bark dashed away 
like spectres gliding swiftly noiseless tread two vanished 
long grass swallowed 
deserted seemed plain 
became unutterably lonely 
stir sound life nothing wide expanse bathed sad gray light 
moon shone steadily silver radiance mellowed stars paled brighter glory 
slowly night hours wore away 
side plain near adjoining forest loomed darkling tall grass parted disclose black form 
deceiving shade cast leafy branch shadow slowly sank lost 
gray unwavering line silver crested grass tufts unbroken 
night breeze wandering caressingly grass might told two dark forms gliding gliding gliding softly surely surely toward forest

like avengers moved mission slay save dark line plain merged forest crawled 
whispering hesitating silent slow certain progress showed purpose 
single file slipped moss leader clearing path 
inch inch advanced 
tedious slow movement difficult painful journey must end lightninglike speed 
rustled leaf snapped twig shook fern passed onward slowly like approach death 
seconds passed minutes minutes hours entire hour spent advancing twenty feet last top knoll reached 
avenger placed hand follower shoulder 
strong pressure meant remind warn reassure 
like huge snake first glided away 
left behind raised head look open place called glade beautiful spring 
oval space lay exceedingly lovely moonlight spring pearl gemmed center 
indian guard stood statuelike stone 
savages lay row polished heads shining 
one slumbering form bedecked feathers frills 
near lay indian blanket border peered two faces gleaming white sad pitying moonlight 
watcher quivered sight pale faces must wait long moments passed 
must wait avenger creep silently kill guard release prisoners without awakening savages 
plan failed rush glade excitement make one captives 
lay waiting listening wrought intensest pitch fierce passion 
every nerve alert every tendon strung every muscle strained ready leap 
faint rustling leaves low swish swaying branches soft murmur falling water sigh night wind proved picture evil dream 
gaze sought quiet figures lingered hopefully captives menacingly sleeping savages glowered gaudily arrayed form 
glance sought upright guard stood dark blot gray stone 
saw indian plume single feather waving silver white 
became riveted bubbling refulgent spring 
pool round perhaps five feet across shone like burnished shield 
mirrored moon twinkling stars spectre trees 
unaccountable horror suddenly swept watching man 
hair stood straight sensation cold stole chillingly 
whether climax long night excitement anticipation bloody struggle soon come knew 
boiling spring shimmering sliver moon rays hold murky depths secret lonesome shadowing trees sad drooping branches harbor mystery future tragedy enacted quiet glade could murmuring water leaves whisper portent silent unintelligible nature mystery 
waiting man cursed craven coward fought back benumbing sense steeled heart 
vaunted willingness share avenger danger strong spirit rose arms brave fierce 
fastened piercing gaze plumed guard 
indian lounging posture rock yet seemed kind strained attention 
savage head poised like listening deer 
wary indian scented danger 
faint moan breathed low sound gently splashing water somewhere beyond glade 
woo oo 
guard figure stiffened became rigidly erect blanket slowly slid feet 
ah oo sighed soft breeze tree tops 
louder deep wail moan arose dark gray shadows swelled thrilling still air died away mournfully 
um mmwoo sentinel form melted shade 
gone like phantom 
another indian rose quickly glanced furtively around glade 
bent comrade shook 
instantly second indian feet 
scarcely gained standing posture object bounding like dark ball shot thicket hurled warriors earth 
moonbeam glinted upon something bright 
flashed swift sweeping circle 
short choking yell aroused savages 
sprang alarmed confused 
shadow form darted among 
moved inconceivable rapidity became monster 
terrible convulsive conflict 
dull blows click steel angry shouts agonized yells thrashing wrestling sounds mingled together half drowned awful roar like mad bull 
strife ceased suddenly begun 
warriors lay still grass others writhed agony 
instant fleeting shadow crossed open lane leading glade vanished 
three savages sprung toward rifles 
blinding flash loud report burst thicket overhead 
foremost savage sank lifelessly 
others intercepted giant shadow brandished rifle 
watcher knoll entered glade 
stood stacked rifles swung heavy gun 
crash indian went sweep rose 
savages backed away threatening figure circled around 
noise conflict ceased 
savages joined three glided fro desperate foe 
closed upon beaten back 
one savage threw glittering knife another hurled stone third flung tomahawk struck fire swinging rifle 
held bay 
firearms master situation 
every sweep arms brought long rifle knocked flint firelock enemy weapon 
soon indians guns useless 
slowly began edge away stone toward opening seen fleeting form vanish 
intention make dash life heard noise behind rock remembered guard 
saw savages glance behind anticipated danger direction must turn 
second might fatal 
backed defiantly along rock gained outer edge 
late indians glided behind surrounded 
turned around around ever circling rifle whirling faces baffled foe 
opposite lane leading glade changed tactics plunged fierce impetuosity midst painted throng 
began fearful conflict 
indians fell sweep powerful arms grappled ground 
literally plowed way struggling mass warding hundred vicious blows 
savage savage flung last clear path 
freedom lay beyond shiny path

white glittering flash flew fleeing runner aim true 
suddenly moonlight path darkened runner sight saw million flashing stars terrible pain assailed sank slowly slowly darkness

looked back picture forever minds lovely spot ghastly quiet bodies dark haunting spring renegade nailed tree tall figure wetzel watched shadow ground 
wetzel also gone two living creatures remained glade doomed renegade white dog 
gaunt beast watched man hungry mad eyes 
long moan wailed forest

gazed stiffening bodies indians gory corpse deering savage eyes dog 
suddenly life seemed surge strong within 
hell fire done fer yet gasped 
damned knife kill pull 
worked heavy knife hilt 
awful curses passed lips blade move 
retribution spoken doom 
suddenly saw dark shadow moving along sunlit ground 
swept past 
looked see great bird wide wings sailing far 
saw another still higher third 
looked hilltop 
quiet black birds taken wing 
floating slowly majestically upward 
watched graceful flight 
easily swooped wide circles 
remembered fascinated boy long long ago home 
home one 
ah long cruel years rolled back 
youth blotted evil returned 
saw little cottage saw old virginia homestead saw brothers mother 
ah h cruel agony tore heart 
leaned hard knife 
pain present returned past remained 
youth manhood flashed 
long bloody merciless years faced crimes crushed upon awful might 
suddenly rushing sound startled 
saw great bird swoop graze tree tops 
another followed another flock 
saw gray spotted breasts hooked beaks 
buzzards muttered darkly eyeing dead savages 
carrion birds swooping feast 
god nailed fast buzzards screamed sudden awful frenzy 
nailed fast ah h ah h ah h eaten alive buzzards ah h ah h ah h shrieked voice failed gasped 
buzzards swooped overhead time brushing leaves 
one great grizzled bird settled upon limb giant oak stretched long neck 
another alighted beside 
others sailed round round dead tree top 
leader arched wings dive swooped glade 
alighted near deering dead body 
dark uncanny bird long scraggy bare neck wreath white grizzled feathers cruel hooked beak cold eyes 
carrion bird looked around glade put great claw dead man breast

agonized yell terror horror echoed mockingly wooded bluff 
huge buzzard flapped wings flew away soon returned gruesome feast

chapter xxix 
fleeting human instinct wetzel given way habit years 
merciless quest many days kill frontier fiend 
accomplished turned vengeance accustomed channel became ruthless indian slayer 
fierce tingling joy surged struck delaware trail 
wingenund made little effort conceal tracks gone northwest straight crow flies toward indian encampment 
start sixty minutes would require six hours rapid traveling gain delaware town 
reckon make fer home muttered wetzel following trail possible speed 
hunter method trailing indian singular 
intuition played great part sight 
seemed always divine victim intention 
trail hard shake bloodhound 
yet means always stick indian footsteps 
wetzel direction greatest importance 
half mile closely followed delaware plainly marked trail 
stopped take quick survey forest 
abruptly left trail breaking run went woods fleetly noiselessly deer running quarter mile stopped listen 
seemed well lowered head walked slowly along examining moss leaves 
presently came upon little open space soil sandy loam 
bent rose quickly 
come upon indian trail 
cautiously moved forward stopping every moment listen 
close pursuits maturer years never victim cunning indian tricks ambush 
relied solely ear learn foes close 
wild creatures forest informants 
soon heard change twittering humming playing whichever way manifested joy fear life became hard see difficult hear creeping snake 
delaware trail led rocky ridge disappeared 
wetzel made effort find chief footprints flinty ground halted moment studied ridge lay land around ravine one side dark impenetrable forest 
calculating chances finding delaware trail far side 
indian woodcraft subtle wonderful may limited indian ability 
savages well men born unequal 
one might leave faint trail forest another could readily traced third cunning skillful fellows flown shady trees trail left 
redmen followed methods woodcraft tradition wetzel learned long years study experience 
satisfied divined delaware intention slipped bank ravine broke run 
leaped lightly sure footed goat stone stone fallen logs brawling brook 
every turn ravine every open place stopped listen 
arriving side ridge left ravine passed along edge rising ground 
listened birds searched grass leaves 
found slightest indication trail expected find one 
retraced steps patiently carefully scrutinizing every inch ground 
vain 
wingenund begun show savage cunning 
warrior days long years chief could rival 
boast always wingenund sought elude pursuers trail faded among moss ferns 
wetzel calm patient resourceful deliberated moment 
delaware crossed rocky ridge 
cunning enough make pursuer think intention 
hunter hurried eastern end ridge reason apparently course one savage least reason take 
advanced hurriedly every moment precious 
crushed blade grass brushed leaf overturned pebble snapped twig find 
saw getting near side ridge delaware trail abruptly ended 
ah twisted bit fern drops dew brushed 
bending beside fern wetzel examined grass crushed 
small plant triangular leaves dark green lay fern 
breaking one leaves exposed lower side light 
fine silvery hair fuzz grew upon leaf crushed 
wetzel knew indian could tread softly break springy grass blades side one leaves man steps always betrays passage woods 
keen eyes leaf showed bruised soft moccasin 
wetzel located trail still ignorant direction 
slowly traced shaken ferns bruised leaves side ridge last near stone found moccasin print moss 
pointed east 
delaware traveling exactly opposite direction going 
moreover exercising wonderful sagacity hiding trail 
however trouble wetzel took long time find trail certainly delaware expended much choosing hard ground logs rocks tread 
wetzel soon realized cunning matched 
trusted intuitive knowledge stuck close trail hungry wolf holds scent quarry 
delaware trail led logs stones hard baked ground stony ravines cliffs 
wily chief used old skill walked backward moss sand footprints showed plainly leaped wide fissures stony ravines jumped back let ledges branches crossed creeks gorges swinging trees climbing one another waded brooks found hard bottom avoided swampy soft ground 
dogged persistence tenacity purpose wetzel stuck gradually fading trail 
every additional rod forced go slowly take time order find sign enemy passage forests 
one thing struck forcibly 
wingenund gradually circling southwest course took farther farther delaware encampment 
slowly dawned upon wetzel chief could hardly reason taking circling course save pride savage joy misleading fooling foe delawares deliberately showing deathwind one indian could laugh loose forests 
wetzel bitter gall 
led wild goose chase fierce heart boiled fury 
dark keen eyes sought grass moss terrible earnestness 
yet spite anger increased white heat passion became aware strange sensation creeping upon 
remembered delawares offered life 
slowly like shadow wetzel passed ridges brown yellow aisles forest babbling brooks upon golden flecked fields always close trail 
last open part forest fire swept away brush smaller timber wetzel came upon spot delaware trail ended 
soft black ground moccasin print 
forest dense plenty light logs stones trees near yet glade evidence indian trail visible 
faded great chief boasted would 
wetzel searched burnt ground crawled hands knees went surroundings 
fact one moccasin print pointed west east showed delaware turned tracks baffling thing ever crossed hunter wild wanderings 
first time many years failed 
took defeat hard successful long thought almost infallible failure lost opportunity kill great foe 
passion cursed weak let prayer woman turn life purpose 
bowed head slow dragging steps made way westward 
land strange knew going toward familiar ground 
time walked quietly time fierce fever veins slowly abating 
calm always except unnatural lust indians blood overcame 
summit high ridge looked around ascertain bearings 
surprised find traveled circle 
mile arose great oak tree recognized landmark beautiful spring 
found standing hill dead tree directed girty attention hours previous 
idea would return spring scalp dead indians went directly toward big oak tree 
forest wide plain lay wooded knoll marked glade beautiful spring 
crossed stretch verdant meadow land entered copse 
suddenly halted 
keen sense usual harmony forest innumerable quiet sounds received severe shock 
sank tall weeds listened 
crawled little farther 
doubt became certainty 
single note oriole warned needed quick notes catbird tell near hand somewhere human life 
wetzel became tiger 
hot blood leaped heart firing veins nerves 
calmly noiseless certain cold deadly snake began familiar crawling method stalking game 
briars thickets across hollows full yellow leaves stony patches ground fern covered cliff overhanging glade glided lithe sinuous tiger movement heart 
parted long graceful ferns gazed glittering eyes beautiful glade 
saw shining spring purple moss ghastly white bones buzzards left dead anything save solitary indian standing erect glade 
within range rifle great indian foe wingenund 
wetzel sank back ferns still furious exultations almost consumed moment marked victim 
lay breathing hard gripping tightly rifle slowly mastering passion alone things might render aim futile 
third great moment life last three moments indian life belonged 
seen dark powerful face sights rifle could shoot one shot must another 
lofty haughty figure stood calm disdainful arrogant yielded woman prayer 
delaware life take swore would trembled ecstasy triumphant passion great muscles rippled quivered moment entirely beyond control 
passion calmed 
power vengeance could almost still beats heart make sure deadly fatal aim 
slowly raised eyes cold fire glittered slowly raised black rifle 
wingenund stood erect old grand pose folded arms eyes instead fixed distant hills lowered ground 
indian girl cold marble lay feet 
garments wet clung slender form 
sad face frozen eternal rigidity 
side newly dug grave 
bead front sight rifle hardly covered chief dark face wetzel eye took details 
absorbed purpose dream delaware reason returning beautiful spring 
slowly wetzel forefinger stiffened slowly lowered black rifle 
wingenund returned bury whispering winds 
wetzel teethe clenched awful struggle tore heart 
slowly rifle rose wavered fell 
rose wavered fell 
something terrible wrong something awful awakening soul 
wingenund made fool 
delaware led long chase given slip forest boast hurry back give daughter christian burial 
wingenund christian cast daughter would never looked upon face 
wingenund true race christian 
suddenly wetzel terrible temptation heart racking struggle ceased 
lowered long black rifle 
took one last look chieftain dark powerful face 
avenger fled like shadow forest
