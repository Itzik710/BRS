let us examine farther 
john effingham felt emboldened encouraging signs unconcern read succeeding letters aloud learned contents simultaneously 
next six eight communications betrayed nothing distinctly beyond fact child formed subject whole correspondence received peter dowse wife retained offspring consideration considerable sum additional engagement pay annuity 
appeared letters also child hypocritically alluded name pet actually transferred keeping jane dowse several years passed arrangement correspondence terminated 
later letters referred payment annuity although contained cold inquiries pet answers vague general sufficiently prove term singularly misapplied 
whole thirty forty letters punctually answered dates covered space near twelve years 
perusal papers consumed hour john effingham laid spectacles table village clock struck hour midnight 
yet observed learned little fact child made take false character without possessing clue circumstances given names parties evidently obscure one material plainly told must borne fictitious name 
even poor monday possession much collateral testimony want could known precise injustice done certainly intentions manifests would left important particular dark 
likely prove complicated affair returned paul clear immediate service 
probably fatigued may without impropriety defer examination another time 
john effingham assented paul short conversation followed brought secretary toilet table along bundle important papers belonged alluded busied replacing whole drawer taken 
formalities seals observed poor monday gave us packet would seem unnecessary remarked thus occupied probably sufficient leave secretary room keep keys

seen much world powis years profession usual think men profession see much world consequence pursuits though agree sir seeing world limited circle 
several years since circumstances might almost say imperative order one bound obey induced resign since time done little else travel 
owing certain adventitious causes enjoyed access european society countrymen possess hope advantage entirely thrown away 
traveller continent europe pleasure first meeting mr miss effingham 
much abroad even child owe little skill foreign languages circumstance

captain ducie believe kinsman sister children though friendship always connexion would infer 
ducie met sea awkwardness coolness interview coupled sudden return england fear make favourable impression witnessed passed 
confidence principles said john effingham frank simplicity though first surmises pleasant perhaps little reflection told us ground suspicion 
ducie fine manly fellow seaman generosity sincerity 
last parted field met enemies circumstance rendered unexpected meeting awkward 
wounds longer smarted true perhaps felt shame sorrow ever inflicted 
serious quarrel could arm sister children said john effingham gravely 
admit much 
time captain ducie disposed admit consanguinity offence grew intemperate resentment imputations birth two military men issue could scarcely avoided 
ducie challenged humor balk 
couple flesh wounds happily terminated affair 
interval three years enabled enemy discover done justice causelessly provoked quarrel ought firm friends 
generous desire make suitable expiation urged seize first occasion coming america offered ordered chase montauk telegraphic communication london hourly expecting sail seas wished come expressly might meet

carry away murderous intention demanded john effingham smiling 
means nothing could amicable ducie got hours together cabin 
often happens violent antipathies unreasonable prejudices nearer view character motives removed every obstacle long reached england two warmer friends could found frank intercourse relatives could desired 
aware sir english cousins often view cis atlantic relatives lenient eyes 
true said john effingham proudly though lip quivered spoke great measure fault miserable mental bondage left country sixty years nominal independence much mercy hostile opinion 
necessary respect order others respect us 
agree sir entirely 
case however previous injustice disposed relatives receive better perhaps might otherwise case 
little ask way fortune feeling disposition raise question might disturb peerage ducies became favorite 
peerage parents english neither believe connection two countries close occasion surprise right nature passed colonies 
mother mother became heiress one ancient baronies pass heirs general consequence deaths two brothers rights however never actually possessed previous generation centered mother aunt 
former dead contended without issue forget lawful issue added paul reddening temples added mrs ducie married younger son english nobleman claimed obtained rank 
pretension would left peerage abeyance probably owe little opposition found circumstance 
ducie generous conduct could hesitate joining application crown decision abeyance might determined favor person possession lady dunluce quietly confirmed claim 
many young men country would cling hopes british peerage greater tenacity probable self denial high order could scarcely expected english ministers would consent give rank foreigner hesitate avowing principles national feelings 
shall say hot covet peerage would supererogatory born american die american american swaggers claim like daw among peacocks

well trust separate night wish ascertain beyond question one fact although circumstances stated scarce leave doubt reply 
understand sir intend leave uncertainty important particular 
feeling painful others man pride distrust purity mother 
mine beyond reproach thank god clearly established could certainly legal claim peerage 
fortune added john effingham drawing long breath like one suddenly relieved unpleasant suspicion 
fortune comes neither parent one generous dispositions caprices sometimes induce men adopt alien blood 
guardian adopted took abroad placed quite young navy dying finally left possessed bachelor near relative artisan fortune could hesitation accepting gift liberally bequeathed 
coupled condition retire service travel five years return home marry 
silly forfeiture exacted either case general course solemnly advised man showed true friend many years 
envy opportunity enjoyed serving 
hope would approved national pride believe must put bottom disinterestedness affair peerage 
would indeed although never knew anything claim arose death two lords preceded aunt brothers grandmother 
guardian respects man nothing manly national pride 
abroad decoration offered declined character dignity one felt distinctions country repudiated every gentleman belonging country ought reject yet respectful gratitude compliment due government offer came 
almost envy man said john effingham warmth 
appreciated powis mark high judgment seems properly appreciated country human nature 
yet little appreciated turn 
man passed years one largest towns apparent account among population one commoner spirits half much one bustling brokers jobbers 
nothing surprising 
class chosen small every numerous given point scattered population like america 
broker naturally appreciate broker dog appreciates dog wolf wolf 
least manliness named likely valued among people put men clothes leading strings 
older dear paul first time john effingham ever used familiar appellation young man thought sounded kindly older dear paul venture tell important fact may hereafter lessen mortifications 
nations high standard man least affects look acts extolled seemingly appreciated naked merits 
little exists america man much praised purposes party feed national vanity 
country others political opinion ought freest persecuted community character nation induces every man think right property fame 
england exhibits great deal weakness injustice feared vicious fruit liberty certain sacred nature opinion appreciated countries least efficiency 
constantly deriding governments fetter opinion yet know nation expression opinion certain attract persecution hostility though may one sense free 
arises potency 
men quarrel opinion opinion rules 
one mode struggling power 
return guardian man think act far magazine newspaper existence americans moral sense pass man could 
indeed newspaper magazine existence said john effingham smiling paul terms know life mediums bad condition english form notions society novels written men women access records court journal 
thank sincerely mr powis confidence idly solicited part shall abused 
distant day break seals renew investigations affair unfortunate monday yet certainly promising way revelations 
gentlemen shook hands cordially paul lighted companion withdrew
