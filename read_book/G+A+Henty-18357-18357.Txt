boy brought news arrest charged plotting william assassination 
rode night news next day road coast happily board away news escape could sent ports 
plans jervoise plans beyond reaching port taking ship france going sweden mr jervoise said repeated reasons given charlie taking step 
old wars sir marmaduke said 
sixty last birthday though still strong active could strike shrewd blow case need old fatigues hardships campaigning 
could hope age obtain commission swedish service 
think joining army sir marmaduke though warrant would well thought might take residence stockholm well saint germains 
find many scottish gentlemen jacobites like forced fly 
besides life air would suit better saint germains accounts life gay one men come think pleasure duty 
moreover money go much sweden france 
sir marmaduke checking horse speed said much penny pocket methinks like trouble getting hoard collecting ever since dutch william came throne benefit majesty arrives 
trouble getting father charlie said laughing seeing nothing lean put hand holsters full see forced carry pistols belt 
mean lad mean father whole hoard stowed away priest hiding place related banks revealed secret hiding place night sir marmaduke removed lancaster castle visited place carried away money 
could see banks said left words scrap paper saying taken money 
otherwise would terrible taking discovered gone 
right good news indeed lad 
twelve years set aside half rents bags holsters six years income interest money laid good mortgages suffice amply wants country like sweden life simple living cheap 
money shall remain untouched use hopes fail estates lost time 
indeed weight mind 
hope equally good case jervoise know would gladly share good case sir marmaduke though none less thank offer 
know put aside half income 
estates large lynnwood 
acreage may large good deal mountain land worth little 
fund therefore large amounts good round sum hope either army way earn income ample 
shall sorry divert use intended helped 
pleasure year year putting king use circumstances changed equally useful 
know country well jervoise personally know nothing save sun tells present traveling south sir marmaduke 
last days closely studying map know name every town village various routes 
whither think going london southampton 
strangers far less noticed large towns small could hardly hope find ship bound sweden dorset devon ports 
chapter sweden 
much discussion party agreed would best make southampton 
road thither less frequented leading london fewer towns passed less chance interruption 
mr jervoise brought valise suit clothes sir marmaduke sober cut fashion 
avoided large towns places put represented traders traveling midlands southern coast arrived southampton without excited smallest suspicion 
indeed throughout journey heard word affray near chapel le frith knew therefore news traveled fast 
southampton however scarcely put inn landlord said suppose gentlemen talking nothing else london rescue desperate jacobite friends 
news reached yesterday 
occasioned good deal scare mr jervoise replied 
suppose word arrest man accomplices traveled slowly news may passed us way 
yet landlord replied 
say northern eastern ports watched make sure catching presents 
general opinion time go hiding friends hills cumberland westmoreland perhaps yorkshire moors sure catch sooner later 
bad business altogether mr jervoise said hope guilty persons time get punishment well deserve 
trade carried country disturbed plots conspiracies indeed landlord repeated heartily 
meddle politics content earn living business receive pay reckoning without caring jot whether whigs tories 
next morning mr jervoise sir marmaduke went port leaving lads wander town pleasure two persons likely attract less attention four 
found two vessels port loading munitions war sweden one would sail shortly 
went board saw captain 
carry passengers none applied far captain said offer say 
want take passage sweden mr jervoise said 
king country say fitting army 
clothes necessary troops swords guns think could obtain contract goods 
hope unless go though sorely loath neither us ever set foot board ship determined making journey together two clerks take passage rate seeing related us 
goods shall take bale two cloth samples goods supply beyond little luggage seeing stay may short one 
little haggling terms two gentlemen wish appear eager go matter finally settled satisfaction parties 
return inn mr jervoise took host aside 
business connected trade cloth sweden hope obtain large contract 
matter may occupy us week month two aught know want horses eating heads away 
besides may able return take passage one devonshire ports would suit us much better 
able need returning horses 
therefore would fain dispose find us purchaser tomorrow night pay fair commission money receive 
doubt readily enough landlord said 
three fine animals fit gentleman riding 
stout hackney 
trust get best price 
next day came room 
good offer horses said 
two gentlemen arrived yesterday france staying inn friend mine requiring horses servants promised friend slice commission bring round hither 
name price would rather mr jervoise said cautiously 
asked high figure might frighten purchasers away 
ask little losers 
daresay named friend price willing give 
better ask good bit come little little maybe seeing horses really good ones may advance bit 
used horse deal leave make bargain 
sorry part animals might die voyage get injured worthless moreover shall use 
therefore must sell ready take best terms get 
returned inn absence two hours found landlord sold horses sum nearly approaching value gentlemen anxious purchase sell 
next day bought three four rolls west country cloth supply clothes suitable condition together trunks carriage

fort would give french dutch hot reception time think capture dockyard shipping sir marmaduke said 
dutch already captured place without shedding drop blood mr jervoise remarked 
true enough knight said stamping foot angrily deck easily may lost quickly 
seen several changes since first remember hope may live see another 
however need talk 
indeed mr jervoise agreed 
may sir marmaduke would better talked thought less last twelve years better lads 
might still ready join majesty soon landed till could nothing seems would wiser gone business without worrying heads say nothing risking matter may take place lives know well enough king france uses stuarts convenience heart cares nothing cause 
convenient means creating trouble weakening william may day may suit send army fight william aid stuarts friends instead fighting holland elsewhere 
whether may think fit one year twenty years hence say question solely military policy 
stuarts simply used french king pull english chestnuts fire 
would established anywhere rather france 
harm vast numbers would otherwise friends rate england 
scotland otherwise scotland always alliance france england different 
france always national foe charles james proved subservient louis william orange would never crowned king 
vast numbers england would rather see stuart dutchman throne never strike blow replace come backed french bayonets

major jamieson came cottage occupied captain jervoise officers late evening 
blazing fire middle november nights sharp 
well jervoise think orders asked seated log brought fire 
thought much except going long quick march somewhere 
somewhere think slightest idea 
would say narva certainly considering five thousand infantry three thousand cavalry large number weakened fever unfit fighting narva report says eighty thousand russians strongly intrenched camp 
well going jervoise nevertheless 
least colonel told 
must surely jesting major 
may going push forward direction occupy strong position army comes would height madness attack enemy strong position tenfold force 
well shall see jamieson said coolly 
certain narva hold much longer know king set heart relieving seem somewhat dangerous enterprise attack russians 
rate direction going tomorrow 
good seventy miles distant say whole country devastated villagers fled evident three days bread meat carry exhausted shall get food russian camp nowhere else 
captain jervoise laughed others 
live short time horses jamieson hard pushed though little beyond skin bone 
true 
cavalry certainly scarcely fit service 
welling troops hard time may thank stars though think time kept nearly three months malmoe instead welling 
seriously think major king means attack russians cunningham asked 
idea cunningham 
see else us 
rate may sure shall make tough fight 
cavalry showed day stand many times number russians fancy 
one thing audacity attempt favor 
well best may sure since thermopylae doubt men fought longer odds 
next morning men fell 
captain jervoise like rank mounted took place head company little army marched away wesenberg 
dreary march purts sight ruined villages devastated fields aroused feeling indignation fury among troops fierce longing attack men ruthlessly spread ruin fertile country 
orders issued evening men husband provisions much possible order strictly obeyed orders usually men saw possibility obtaining fresh supplies wasted country well aware existed train waggons horses capable bringing stores wesenberg 
aged men women remaining purts learned next day march would take difficult pass held six hundred russian cavalry together force infantry guns

king right said 
russian army time form advance us order battle must annihilated 
present camp extensive one hear extends great semi circle four five miles long ends resting river

king already reconnoitred portion position exposing recklessly shot soon troops came issued orders prepare attack two columns 
first however several regiments ordered fall cut bushes make fascines enable troops cross ditches

king wing bodyguard hoped might meet czar commanding person 
russian emperor however left camp morning fetch forty thousand men advancing plescow command army assumed duke croy 
swedish left wing battery twenty one guns sixteen guns covered attack right 
two clock afternoon two guns gave signal advance 
hitherto weather fine become gradually overcast signal given tremendous storm snow hail began 
set right face russians concealed movement swedes indeed wholly unprepared believing small force saw advance guard great swedish army attack need expected main body arrived 
consequence swedes almost edge ditch perceived columns attacked vigor courage quarter hour gained footing intrenchments filled ditch fascines cavalry able follow 
russians astounded sudden attack lost heart altogether 
swedish left soon entered intrenchments swept along russians abandoning guns batteries making bridge across river 
unfortunately huts built close behind works rear another intrenchment designed repel assaults town terrified crowd unable make way rapidly along ground encumbered huts crossed interior intrenchments thinking make way faster fields bridge 
swedish king however placed head bodyguard followed rest horse charged right upon cutting great numbers driving rest towards river infantry kept heavy fire upon fugitives intrenchments 
panic spread quickly russian troops nearest bridge already pouring mass fugitives arrived 
pressed upon bridge numbers speedily gave way cutting retreat comrades behind 
ignorant result terrified crowd pushed pressing front river number drowned less fell beneath bullets pikes sabres swedes 
despair russians rallied generals attempted defend occupying houses barracks barricading passages overturned waggons fought bravely repulsed time every effort swedes 
darkness falling king hastened spot battle fiercely raging

however pushed placed head infantry engaged assault 
even presence example avail 
russians maintained position desperate courage became quite dark assault ceased 
right column met equal success 
penetrated intrenchments defeated russians opposed moved assist left wing 
king however seeing russian defences could carried direct assault without great loss gathered army space town russian intrenchments placed position repel attack russians take offensive giving orders daylight hill enemy principal battery assaulted

officers command russian right wing finding unable cross river broken bridge surrounded swedes sent surrender course evening two battalions swedish guards took possession post gallantly defended 
king granted permission retire arms colors standards given superior officers retained prisoners war 
broken bridge repaired early next morning russian troops passed 
left wing surrender right hopeless position side bridge thrown river retreat wholly cut

many names officers well known two three captains glasgow college jock 
like old times four five us talking wild doings together 
supper children sent bed 
allan ramsay lit long pipe 
bottle wine two glasses placed table mrs ramsay withdrew see domestic matters prepare room charlie 
lad tell allan ramsay said 
jock tells mission would leave explain business mine would rather keep ask questions 
secret far concerned mr ramsay merchants come talk went fully subject 
scotchman sat smoking pipe silence minutes concluded 
much meddle politics 
neither voice part making kings laws beyond like peace loving king matters little us diet may set us 
put tips fingers polish affairs might give thought trade 
forever intriguing plotting except fighting would weary work keep touch much less take part 
business buy sell parties come us matters little one money good 
one set creditors deeper books another might wish party gain day would maybe set funds might get money matters little 
customer debt 
money always scarce reckless extravagant keeping horde idle loons spending much money attire wives would keep whole scotch clan victuals 
pay money pay corn cattle wine hides 
know fondest plotting fighting feasting yet reckless people like 
sell votes money scotchman throw teeth scarce scotch noble since days bruce ready sell english gold 
highlanders fond fighting poles chiefs profuse hospitality reckless spendthrift 
poles virtues 
love country ready die 
courteous even chivalrous hospitable excess good husbands kindly masters recklessly brave unduly fond finery supply many last find fault score 
proud look upon us traders hurt us take trading would place us 
nothing present purpose 
certainly question polish affairs neither foreign jewish merchants would move finger one way 
everything lose nothing gain 
suppose took sides one parties got upper hand 
might make ordinances hampering us every way laying heavy taxes us forbidding export cattle horses making lives burdensome 
true drove us would soon repeal law trade would end 
would late many us 
however say present time many would disposed could augustus saxony 
accustomed civil wars though may cause misery ruin districts take place touch us capital 
different affair 
augustus without reason provocation brought fiery king sweden upon us continues throne may hear swedish cannon thundering outside walls may city taken sacked 
therefore politics become natural business 
though may find many well wishers doubt obtain substantial aid 
saxon troops town nobles divided hope successful rising warsaw 
king think charlie said 
opinion evident citizens warsaw strongly opposed augustus saxony would great moral effect perhaps might influence nobles say deeply books upon whose estates may hold mortgages join party king 
might something way allan ramsay agreed 
course money mortgages 
want badly enough money lay hands business 
giving credit often long credit requires large capital carry trade 
jews doubt hold large mortgages land exert much power 
hold land one venture sell property noble influence would ruined 
whole class would shrink like enough would tumult got house would burned head family murdered 
still far popular opinion goes something might done 
rate get friends tomorrow introduce talk 
must careful augustus strong party suspected swedish officer would go hard 
tomorrow must fetch servant 
already sent round inn find valises room 
said could rely thoroughly upon yes handed count piper moreover seen confident trusted 
swedish descent think honest fellow 
fortnight charlie remained allan ramsay spite pressing entreaties host hostess took lodging near 
time seen good many leading traders town 
scotch frenchmen heartily agreed argument benefit poland especially warsaw augustus saxony replaced another king would acceptable charles sweden opinion little could done towards bringing result 
jewish traders success less decided 
admitted would great misfortune warsaw taken swedes poles retained confidence national army altogether sceptical thousand swedes could withstand host could put field 
several pointedly asked interest matter charlie obliged use power promising sums money case success 
one two however felt doubtful 
chief among ben soloman muller man great influence jewish community 
man placed large value upon services charlie feel justified promising sum 
like man face rely upon promises silence given mission revealed 
reason principally determined go lodgings 
denounced serious trouble might fall upon allan ramsay would least minimize risk living house arrested 
ramsay disposed make light danger 
believe ben soloman old rogue fool 
help seeing position king precarious cause arrest might get little thanks profit would incurring risk vengeance charles ever become master town 
arrested would forced appear witness could hardly without matter becoming publicly known 
say however could curry favor king party harm without appearing matter would hesitate moment 
even arrested doubt whether great harm would befall scotch merchants would make common cause although political power good deal influence one way another augustus time would care make fresh enemies 
however lad dispute decision 
quite alone would let leave long stop city without taking great offence wife two children man timid think 
charlie therefore moved lodging every day went three four hours shop kept assumed character aiding keep ledgers learning polish assistants value various goods shop 
one evening returning supper lodging stanislas met 
observed three four evil looking rascals casting glances house today several rough looking fellows hanging house evening 
know means anything thought would let know 
think must fancy stanislas 
might arrested troops denounced apprehend danger men class speak 
however interfered fancy could deal several rascals sort 
corner street three four men standing 
one moved passed pushed rudely sending hat gutter 
face exposed fellow exclaimed death swedish spy last words uttered 
charlie sword flew scabbard rapid pass ran man body 
others drew instantly fell upon charlie fury keeping shout death swedish spy evidently signal men darted doorways came running street repeating cry 
go stanislas charlie shouted defended dozen assailants 
tell ramsay happened good 
moment later received tremendous blow back head iron bound cudgel fell senseless ground 
chapter evil plight 
charlie recovered senses found lying bound room lighted dim lamp sufficed show beams blackened smoke age walls constructed rough stone work 
far could see furniture whatever imagined underground cellar used perhaps time storeroom

mr ramsay letter keep till 
went well together 
heard story killed ben soloman left yes letter arrived mr ramsay sent told jewish trader informed news come ben soloman murdered deed done young scotchman 
mr ramsay believe story slightest 
admitted ben soloman might murdered even said frankly hated natural end come done said absurd 
first place think alive second far probable murdered ben soloman murdered 
however even letter came three four hours later seemed longer doubt killed jew 
time quite uproar among people 
leader community dealings many nobles influence great although little liked regarded important person loss heavy one jewish community 
deputation went governor heard troops would sent capture band brigands joined 
mr ramsay told fortunate indeed returned city 
doubt told letter 
feel quite another man stanislas charlie said changed garments 
read letter brought 
expressing great satisfaction felt news charlie alive mr ramsay went say even well could return warsaw present state public feeling 
story attacked grievously wounded confined days carried away confined wood order ben soloman visited would treated derision 
version given man brought story jew death staying cottage charcoal burner acquaintance party brigands one arrived boasting caused death ben soloman fallen hand 
managed escape brigands road found dead body employer knew morning coming give instructions 
opinion friends knew fellow killed robbed master letter course showed account true extent ben soloman fallen struggle prisoner hands bandits 
still would next impossible prove truth story jews place numerous influential dead life would certainly forfeited captured 
know story true would appear wildly improbable others wealthy jew conspired first place cause attack made upon unknown young stranger still less carried forest gone visit 
explanation swedish officer disguise would benefit way would involve us knew danger would cause jew regarded man lost life endeavoring unmask plot poland 
therefore think extremely fortunate present safe hands brigands certainly advise make attempt leave perfectly well strong 
directed hidden pieces gold shoe handed rest money man starting join 
conceal 
heard body troops starting forest orders sent towns send detachments different points evident authorities determined catch possible 
killed half dozen traders smaller way would cared little present pressed king want money bound everything please jewish traders upon must rely loans payment troops 
matter leave stone unturned gratify strongly advise band move away neighborhood rate time 
may plunder whole villages impunity regarded murder richest citizen warsaw man mixed business politics half principal nobles land different matter altogether 
think trying traverse country perfectly strong 
dangerous business best man bear brunt replying questions every confidence succeed making way 
give advice saying point may start directions may travel 
time find town countrymen established trade find nearly everywhere use name 
think pretty generally known scotchmen poland 
see inclosed note useful 
inclosure contained words allan ramsay merchant warsaw declare bearer note friend beg countrymen mine may present assist every way require money furnish undertaking make responsible pay monies charges may incur 
first thing charlie said placed letters doublet let leader band know bodies troops besides hut enter forest

may said 
seldom bands disperse like ever come together 
impossible content everyone man chosen leader party may dissatisfied persuade join band 
even go body many sure break make homes enjoy booty gathered 
upon hand go shall gather fresh recruits 
many disbanded soldiers discontented men roaming country difficulty getting many men one cares keep together 
fifty outside advisable even one makes good haul comes little head men dissatisfied 
course work small parties succeed well small band single leader 
long work since last autumn 
find pay get much money 
saw four rix dollars head result month work 
still bad men might otherwise starve 
sometimes worse sometimes better average 
still life pleasant one unless disbanded soldiers took would us government would keep us regular pay would soon brigands left except men escaped justice 
treasury empty even best times troops badly irregularly paid forced plunder keep life together 
almost rags though poles mind fighting generally difficulty getting sufficient infantry 
cavalry nobles draw pay 
feel today better 
night rest wash change clothes morning made feel another man 
far intend march shall go slowly day two 
parties pushed ahead fast taking matters quietly keeping sharp lookout need great fear surprised 
know forest well thickest hiding places afford travel slowly become accustomed able make longer journeys 
ten days traveled forest increasing distance daily charlie regained strength 
last day two make less twenty miles day 
faces turned steadily east 
occasionally passed large tracts cleared land villages cultivated fields 
stopped replenished stock flour took without paying farther damage 
meat abundance 
two three men started day soon halted short time returned goat young pig 
close bug river ladislas said last halting place 
tomorrow shall meet least comrades 
expect great many pretty equally divided direction travel 
practically safe pursuit gone fifteen miles forest spreads greatly search us would know pursuit would useless 
many men care going farther part country harried last two three years thought best try altogether new ground 
crossed bug shall beyond forest great swamps morasses hills patches wood 
many streams take rise meeting farther forming dnieper 
must keep north river south country thinly populated difficulty maintaining 
charlie made comment glad hear band intended keep north dnieper river would formed serious obstacle making way rejoin swedes 
next day reached bank bug following river came hour walking upon great fire round fifteen men stretched

plenty us travel 
doubt agreed starting much done part country 
civil wars bands soldiers without leader others like mean starve peasants wrought state desperation 
little left lose got ready fight death lately first alarm sounded bells assembled miles round equipped scythes flails routed meddled

chapter treed wolves 
charlie stanislas evening sitting apart rest short distance fire talking future 
agreed would comparatively easy withdraw band journeyed forward seemed likely traveled small parties 
indeed found two others could leave openly would scarcely care enter upon desperate struggle merely sake retaining two unwilling companions band 
difficulties would begin started alone 
talking captain came across

like young englishman like companion seems honest fellow would keep force 
understand placed 
live 
us would live honestly could present choice starving 
occasionally take crowns come across fat trader may ease rich farmer hoard seldom chance comes way 
rule simply plunder must live 
different 
friends may far away get would need 
therefore life hard rough say nothing danger suit must stay us would madness attempt escape 
told peasants maddened would kill passing stranger would wild beast 
would regard spy band like company disbanded soldiers sent forward discover houses villages best worth plundering 
case dangers fear 
may sure news sent warsaw different governors orders arrest killing ben soloman orders transmitted every town village 
hair eyes would betray strangers ignorance language would fatal 
therefore escaped killed robber peasants would run risk arrest first town village entered 
translate stanislas 
learning language fast understand 
talking charlie said stanislas repeated captain speech danger seems great risked 
think get farther east shall able make way easily livonia much easily forest extensive winter 
cold terrible would death sleep without shelter

motive 
live way gather little money help us winter 
may shoot bear elk sometimes deer hares shall want two three sacks flour spirits 
must either get money take goods

stanislas brought little money warsaw shall ready pay common treasury sum sufficient pay share food 
money taken shall expect share 
attacked shall course fight shall ready full share work 
rate losers taking us 
fair enough captain said stanislas translated charlie said suppressing however remarks foraging army brigands ignorant charlie connection swedes given young englishman come set trader 
band journeyed slowly keeping near north bank dnieper 
went twos threes uniting sometimes entering village surrounding farmhouse night taking wanted 
people however terribly poor able obtain little beyond scanty supplies flour occasionally gold silver trinkets 
many bands plunderers passed along course summer robbers often moved pity misery everywhere met 
small parties obliged avoid entering villages twice furious attacks made upon women joining men arming weapon came hand falling upon strangers 
succeed obtaining plunder value

every luxury starving 
leaving village man spoken repeated said agreed make attempt

band fought stoutly greatly outnumbered carried firearms great advantage weapons 
charlie stanislas finding lives stake forced take part fray survivors band last succeeded fighting way village leaving half number behind twenty peasants fallen

altogether therefore lack food teaching captain charlie time learned able keep direction woods often able go either stanislas alone thus keeping clear close smoky hut hours daylight 
upon whole found life means unpleasant one 
among articles purchased captain high boots lined sheepskin coming thigh

obliged hang supply meat ropes boughs distance ground means enabled prevent bears getting 
longer dared venture far hut large packs wolves ranged forest driven hunger even entered villages attacked killed many women children made entrance sheds tore dogs horses cattle pieces became last dangerous villagers obliged keep great fires burning streets night frighten away 
several times occupants hut awakened whining snarling wolves outside 
walls roof alike built solid timber roughly made door thick wood fastened every night opening stoutly supported beams behind defy assault

met russians poles wood plenty room ay would thousand every one working friendly terms especially two nations present allied sweden 
spite wolves charlie continued walks forest accompanied always stanislas 
carried axes pistols although charlie heard many tales solitary men even vehicles attacked wolves broad daylight believed stories exaggerations chances two men attacked daylight small indeed 
found track cart brought stores good deal used snow swept away levelled runners sledges either peasants came forest wood charcoal travellers journeying russia poland 
generally selected road walk less laborious wading untrodden snow fear losing way spared incessant watchfulness signs necessary among trees 
first frequently met peasants carts road since cold became severe wolves numerous daring longer encountered 
indeed heard last saw come charcoal burners abandoning huts going villages 
one afternoon return nearly reached spot left road strike across forest hut heard noise behind 
pack wolves full cry stanislas exclaimed 
better get tree 
something 
hastily clambered tree whose lower branches six seven feet ground 
moment later two horses wild fright dashed past twenty yards behind came pack fifty sixty wolves 
almost silent red tongues hanging 
brutes attacking sledge stanislas said low tone 
saw horses harnessed broken traces hanging side 
easy read story 
sledge attacked horses mad fear broke traces rushed perhaps driver seeing last moment escape impossible slashed ropes knife give horses chance 
expect got start wolves would detained little sledge 
think poor beasts get safe forest stanislas think may 
chase evidently long one wolves tired first efforts come

even darkness could see wolves lying snow occasionally changing position keeping close together warmth often snarling growling angrily one two shifted position tried squeeze get warm spot 
cold intense spite swinging legs arms charlie felt vital heat decreasing 
awful stanislas 
think last till morning

tree pyramid fire lighting snow long distance round 
outside circle wolves could heard whining whimpering occasionally uttering long drawn howl 
know baulked prey stanislas said

besides wolves cowed great fire think courage meddle strong party 
one one arms tree fell burnt point touched trunk 
would far heavy dragged three four fell across lower fire lay blazing 
knowing way tree would fall charlie companion obliged remain distance heat amply sufficient 
last trunk fell crash established near fire could sit without scorched chatted morning began break 
felt sure least wolves around occasionally caught sight looked like two sparks among undergrowth knew reflection fire eyes wolf 
tree hard could necessary take refuge therefore resolved stay near fire 
fortunately night perfectly still tree fired detached one flames spread charlie one time afraid would 
half hour daylight fairly broken discharged three shots regular intervals pistols waited half hour

charlie drew pistol reply companion touched arm 
look said 
charlie turned time see several gray forms flit rapidly bushes 
stepped edge road saw wolves spring bushes go straight along road 
scared asked surprise

besides would fled deeper forest instead taking road 
perhaps hear something coming 
almost moment two shots heard direction towards wolves making 
charlie excitedly exclaimed 
another body wolves attacked passing traveller

still going away best pace bound 
charlie speaking ladislas one travellers talking stanislas answer question informed charlie service latter english gentleman variety circumstances especially suspicion strangers regarded unable travel country therefore passing winter hunting company disbanded soldiers opportunely arrived assistance

burning tree mystery us shall die curiosity remain another two months matter unexplained 
words possible charlie related men story preceding night greeted exclamations surprise admiration 
truly wits captain said 
frozen death position certainly never thought lighting fire tree 
well goodbye see may good fortune attend may saints protect danger 
charlie shook hands men round hurried sledge 
coachman already front seat countess child taken places two armed servants stanislas standing behind readiness jump board fastened runners 
must apologize keeping waiting countess charlie said ran 
explain friends words come 
also longing know count said 
yet introduced wife learned name gentleman owe much 
ah sir young countess said holding hand charlie given name owe shall never forget never 
talk started feodora 
let us get forest soon 
took place beside wife set child knees brother charlie sitting opposite 
servants spread bearskin rug knees jumped places driver cracked whip horses started 
must think us almost mad driving forest time year count said charlie 
countess russian 
staying two months father place hundred miles east 
two youngest children home two days since message arrived saying one dangerously ill 
heard course many tales numbers fierceness wolves hoped traveling day excellent horses much fear especially five armed men 
fell wolves yesterday beat easily enough 
last night stopped little village forest 
certainly made feel uneasy tales wolves help 
started soon day broke driven fifteen miles came 
gone five wolves began show 
first kept well behind us presently came upon large number joined near saw overturned sledge snow stained blood round 
kept running fight must killed score numbers increased rather diminished fresh pack came ahead quarter mile saw looked case hopeless horses going top speed time started beginning flag wolves fast closing upon us beginning attack horses saw road 
pray tell us came opportunely great fire blazing 
charlie gave full history previous night adventure 
wonderful count brother exclaimed former went heard many stories escapes wolves never one like 
admirable thought indeed obtaining heat frightening wolves away setting tree fire 
thought saved lives well fate would unfortunate travellers whose horses saw brought wolves upon 
sir would impertinent ask purpose come poland believe put question order see way assistance 
know count whether avowal affect unfavourably know make difference conduct towards 
servant told englishman birth father obliged consequence political opinions leave country captain service charles sweden 
exclamations surprise broke hearers 
well sir count said smiling majesty king charles although yet one twenty one greatest generals europe consider strange appear older captain service 
pictured officers wonderful soldiers fierce looking men regular iron veterans 
eighteen charlie said feel absurd captain 
two years since appointed ensign king happening company sharp fight russians rewarded us us made regiment us got promotion 
appointed captain last may reward suggestion turned useful 
may ask captain carstairs seems full happy ideas king charles may heard speaks freely officers soldiers moves camp 
standing edge river looking across saxons day made passage king came spoke 
said hope passage covered advance russians narva snowstorm said wind backs set fire great straw stacks smoke would hide movements saxons 
idea simple one would doubt occurred king however put execution success good enough afterwards promote rank captain 
owing army rather saxon army poles engaged battle defeated count said smiling 
well sir harm us personally entirely opposed augustus saxony 
yet explained officer swedish service came 
sent king charles warsaw ascertain feeling trading classes 
introduction scottish merchant passed countryman come enter business 
one objects mission endeavor induce foreign merchants warsaw could promote feeling favor peace swedes substitution another king place augustus 
clear captain carstairs fulfilling object passing winter party robbers suppose disbanded soldiers little better forest confines russia 
charlie laughed 
rather long story count 
perhaps kindly tell news public affairs first 
means count said 
long story wife would much rather hear listen 
yet recovered events morning 
wait village 
left forest behind us another half hour take us stromoff get pretty good accommodation 
horses splendid pair animals passage forest shown every sign fear starting nervously swerving going sharp sudden rushes always needing constant strain reins keep bolting 
away trees however settled fast trot seven miles stromoff done less half hour 
sooner landlord inn learn name guest wife sons bustled greatest haste make things comfortable 
huge fires lighted guest rooms common room cleared customers chamber sufficiently warmed occupation kitchen preparations made meal half hour arrival party sledge sat 
settles placed round fire charlie gave full account adventures time attacked streets warsaw 
captain carstairs keen search september 
death ben soloman made great stir assure great many people owe debt gratitude 
man sons property passed widow seems treated harshly lifetime 
holland wished return people means large made easiest terms whose estates husband held mortgages order wind affairs soon possible 
thus death subject wide rejoicings 
however caught time fear would gone hard jews keen man rascal though one chief heads religion fall hands towns would either kill send warsaw 
sir tell taken place since september things moved slowly 
augustus endeavored defeat dwina make peace charles account without knowledge diet charles refused give audience agents would even see beautiful countess konigsmark know swede augustus sent thinking blandishments might win young king 
useless 
charles maintained ground took first namely would treat diet would nothing whatever say augustus 
diet sent embassy four senators 
instead receiving every pomp ceremony expected king met horseback 
demanded first condition dethrone augustus 
parties diet pretty equally divided proposal rejected even hostile augustus resented proposal free unconquered people ordered foreign prince change king 
nothing came 
swedish army advanced certain distance poland great number skirmishes serious fighting much chance snow gone country dried spring 
present augustus quarrelling diet still set importation saxon troops 
doubtless campaign begins earnest settled matters senators way respect 
however little chance diet agreeing call whole forces country next battle like last swedes saxons may perhaps thousand poles belonging king party 
belong king party count 
like majority nobles interest whatever war never consulted began 
affair saxony swedes 
let fight 
would bad day poland augustus russians overcome despoil sweden 
want addition territory would strengthen kings us 
see trouble caused augustus saxony command territory country would divided two parts one would nothing common 
still less wish see russia gain territory north us 
hitherto thought little muscovites war shown put great armies field czar making nation may day formidable us 
charles sent every assurance ill towards poland enemy country king formed coalition time profound peace hostility altogether cease overthrow expulsion augustus 
see live distance capital hold altogether aloof intrigues court look fray one part lot 
augustus drives swedes shall probably trouble afterwards 
charles drives augustus shall fresh king shall doubt choose one upon recommendation charles march away leaving us manage affairs 
therefore animosity whatever swedish officer comfort sake better nothing said introduce friends simply english gentleman rendered greatest possible service 
countess retired bed short time finished meal others sat talking late evening 
charlie learned country still greatly disturbed state 
parties disbanded soldiers others rendered desperate cold hardship everywhere plundering peasantry many encounters taken place nobles retainers marched 
travel would dangerous long time come 
therefore spring must think moving count said 
indeed think best plan start work due north join swedish forces near narva 
shorter well less dangerous 
still talk later 
next morning started early arrived afternoon chateau count 
fortified building poles differed western nations abstaining fortifying towns residences upon ground free people capable defending country foreign invasion therefore requiring fortified towns places added risks civil war enabled factions set nation defiance 
building large one struck charlie singularly plain barn like comparison residences country gentlemen england 
number retainers ran drove courtyard exclamations surprise dismay rose wounds horses flanks legs visible words count told attacked wolves saved principally english gentleman follower men crowded round charlie kissed hands ways tried show gratitude rescue master mistress 
come along count said taking arm leading house 
poor fellows mean well must vexed 
countess first question child exclamation thankfulness heard better hurried house 
soon entered count left charlie charge brother also hurried away

fort raised russians bank prevent succor conveyed town two thousand men crossed river occupied small redoubt northern side town completely invested 
newly arrived force ordered march hundred horse four field pieces whole command major sion well acquainted country 
think expedition captain carstairs lieutenant john bowyer asked 
would rather back king charles charlie replied 
course know geography place russians keep eyes open see force like cavalry guns hope enter town unnoticed 
addition horsemen seems altogether ridiculous could good whatever enter town 
four field pieces hamper march say russians already forty cannon position town little pieces would useless 
four hundred infantry making attempt night good guidance might manage slip place procession mind tempting destruction certainly hope cut way force whole russian army 
even get inside town plight better 
russians cannon bombarding night day batteries course erection schlippenbach governor believe brother general pieces reply 
army advancing relief place would different altogether reinforcement might vital importance repelling assaults aid arrived 
hope aid 
king army nine hundred miles away hands full 
general schlippenbach sent many men could spare 
say least twenty thousand russians round town army come compel raise siege mind shall either destroyed making way town get shall made prisoners war massacred russians vague ideas giving quarter town falls may fortnight hence

much 
best possible thing could befall us would russians make us get far lines case may able fall back gather overwhelming strength may thus draw without great loss 
major sion called captains infantry companies troop horse sort council war little force halted hour three clock afternoon 
another ten miles march gentlemen like ask opinion whether would best try force way soon get halt distance three four miles russians make effort daybreak fairly afoot 
three officers gave opinion order seniority advocated plan falling upon muscovites daybreak 
think captain carstairs major sion asked charlie 
regret say major opinion differs gentlemen several reasons 
first place halt near russians presence neighborhood may betrayed peasant may surprised night 
mishap take place foot two hours sunrise 
way doubt knowledge road times difficult make mere track like following night morning might well find involved russian intrenchments could extricate large force gathered round us case must either killed taken prisoners 
suggestion would remain another two hours continue march reach spot endeavor break line sunset 
observed likely might hour taken freshly arrived body russian troops 
would risk losing way might hope close upon discovered enemies 
succeed trust shall breaking way reaching town well good 
hand find greater obstacles expect forced fall back fighting shall advantage darkness setting 
russians greater part ignorant strength lose time move fearing may assaulted quarters darkness might able make good escape certain none us would meet repulse daybreak 
reasons captain carstairs 
though certainly opinion accordance given fellow officers bound say argument seems unanswerable 
say gentlemen two objects view first reinforce garrison notteburg second save troops command fail
