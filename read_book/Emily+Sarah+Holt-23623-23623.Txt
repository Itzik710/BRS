harvest home sixteenth august arrived amphillis week hazelwood 
means concluded process known settling 
contrary never felt unsettled feeling grew rather diminished 
even alexandra ricarda tried less present companions one sense puzzled less though teased 
beginning understand mistress whose mood usually one weary lack interest energy occasionally broken either seasons acute sorrow sudden flashes fiery anger last less trying first indeed seemed sometimes amphillis served vent relief time weariness shade less dreary languor scarcely quite overpowering 
late evening night harvest home sir godfrey returned home attended squire master norman hylton 
impression received amphillis concerning master house fitting pendant wife tall square stern 
know sir godfrey rather wild youth men become correspondingly severe precise old age 
heart changed simply sins youth driven sins maturer life 
satan always willing let slaves replace one sin another makes none less surely 
sir godfrey suffered sense inconsistency sternly rebuking exhibited agatha matthew slight tendencies evil types addicted 
sown wild oats become reformed character outside cup platter beautifully clean never much occurred question condition inside 
yet within foul things alienation god hardness heart love gold grew upon year year 
thought excellent man though whitewashed sepulchre 
lifted head high stood court temple effusively thanked god men 
excellent man said everybody knew perhaps little particular rather severe peccadilloes young people 
time came another voice pronounced final sentence whitewashed life verdict scarcely well done norman hylton sat opposite amphillis supper table manner people could sit opposite mediaeval table namely form squared horseshoe 
table always one boards laid across trestles narrow inside horseshoe reserved servants hand dishes 
therefore yards distance opposite neighbors 
amphillis studied neighbor far occasional glance direction allowed came conclusion nothing remarkable except expression face 
neither tall short neither handsome ugly neither lively morose 
talked little next neighbor matthew foljambe nothing manner either provoke curiosity subject conversation 
expression puzzled amphillis 
dark eyes like countess thought weary sometimes fiery aspect replaced look perfect contentment peace 
yet utterly different self satisfied expression beamed sir godfrey eyes 
manner man master hylton asked agatha always sat next 
precedence table regulated strict rules
