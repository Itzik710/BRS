chapter ii 
gino falcone think mother see appeared scenes already set 
one picture burnt acid upon memory picture mere mention name mere thought never fails evoke like ghost 
see always appeared one evening came suddenly without warning upon falcone armoury citadel 
see tall slight graceful woman oval face translucent pallor wax framed nun like coif thrown long black veil fell waist joined black unrelieved draperies always wore 
sable garb mere mourning father 
death made little change apparel general life 
ever thus far memory travel always raiment trailing funereal draperies 
see pallid face sunken eyes around great brown patches seemed intensify depth set sombre lustre rare occasions raised slim wax like hands chaplet beads entwined left wrist hanging thence silver crucifix end 
moved almost silently ghost passed seemed leave trail sorrow sadness wake worldly woman leaves trail perfume 
thus looked came upon us evening thus live ever memory first time knew rebellion yoke imposing upon first time wills clashed mine consequence maybe first time considered purpose defined 
thing befell three months coming falcone mondolfo 
old man arms exerted strong attraction upon young mind readily understand 
intimate connection dimly remembered father stood secretly imagination position mother would st augustine occupy drew equerry like metal lodestone 
attraction reciprocal 
accord old falcone sought lingering neighborhood first like dog looks kindly word 
long wait 
daily meetings talks daily grow length stolen hours said word mother others season well 
talks naturally father falcone came know something greatness noble souled valiant gentleman old servant painted one combined courage lion wiliness fox 
discoursed feats arms together described charges horse set nerves tingle fancy heard blare trumpets deafening thunder hooves upon turf 
escalades surprises breaches stormed camisades ambushes dark treacheries great heroisms descant fire youthful fancy fill first delight frenzy came think things life must part another road set gray gloomy road end dangled reward greatly interest 
one day fighting endeavor pitting force force astuteness astuteness came talk fighting art 
old falcone first heard marozzo miracle worker weapons master whose academy bologna craft swordsmanship acquired fighting irons beast claws sheer brute strength brute instinct man might practiced skill knowledge gain advantages mere strength must spend vain 
told amazed beyond anything ever heard even told illustrated flinging poises taught marozzo might appreciate marvellous science thing 
thus first time made acquaintance acquaintance held men days marvellous guards marozzo devising falcone showed difference mandritto roverso false edge true stramazone tondo left spellbound marvellous guard appropriately called marozzo iron girdle low guard level waist parry gives opening point one movement may ward strike 
last questioned admitted wanderings father recklessness alternated curiously caution ventured city bologna notwithstanding papal fief sole purpose studying marozzo falcone daily accompanied witnessed lessons afterwards practiced father come learn secrets marozzo taught 
one day last timidly like one whilst overconscious utter unworthiness ventures crave boon knows without right expect asked falcone would show something marozzo art real weapons 
feared rebuff 
thought even old falcone might laugh one predestined study theology desiring enter mysteries sword craft 
fears far indeed foundation 
laughter equerry gray eyes whilst smile upon lips smile gladness eagerness almost thankfulness see set 
came pass daily thereafter practice hour armoury sword buckler every lesson proficiency iron grew manner falcone termed prodigious swearing born sword knack blood 
may affection caused overrate progress made aptitude showed may even said good natured flattery one loved would take pleasure 
yet look back lad incline think spoke sober truth 
alluded curious almost inexplicable delight afforded feel hands balance pike first time 
fain would tell something felt first fingers closed sword hilt forefinger passed quillons new manner falcone showed 
defies power words 
sweet seduction balance white gleaming beauty blade things thrilled something akin thrill first kiss passion 
quite know yet think nothing else life worthy compared 
time lad thirteenth year well grown strong beyond age despite fact mother restrained exercises horsemanship arms wrestling boys years attain development 
stood almost tall falcone accounted good height reach fell something short made youthful quickness movements soon unless good nature refrained exerting full vigor found falcone match

lips moved awhile silence whether everlasting prayers whether endeavoring speak could emotion know 
last voice came laden chill reproach

instant rebellion stirred 
coming turned cold body overheated exercise sweating furiously 
sound voice something injustice oppressed something unreasoning bigotry chained fettered stood clear mental vision first time 
warmed warmth sullen indignation 
returned answer beyond curtly respectful invitation speak mind couched reproof single word address 
madonna challenged emulating something old falcone attitude drew erect flung back head brought eyes level effort never yet exerted 
think bravest thing ever 
felt one feels nerved enter fire 
thing done ease surprised 
followed catastrophe expected 
glance grown suddenly bold eyes drooped fell away habit 
spoke thereafter without looking cold emotionless voice peculiar always voice one founts sweet tolerant tender life ever frozen
