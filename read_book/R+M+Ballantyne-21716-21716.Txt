chapter one 
hero makes first flash explosion 
somewhere middle nineteenth century baby boy born raging sea midst howling tempest 
boy hero tale 
cradled squalls nourished squalor week dirty weather converted fore cabin emigrant ship something like pig sty 
appreciating situation doubt baby boy began career squall harmonised weather steward remarked ship cook continued squall straight end day night without much ever takin breath right add steward prone exaggeration 
stooard said ship cook reply raised eyes contemplation bubbling coppers take word babby bin launched agoin shovel mortal coil play actor said without makin mark ow somew eres 
makes think johnson asked steward 
makes think stooard replied cook huge good natured young man 
well tell ee 
standin close fore hatch time talkin jim brag father babby poor feller standin foretops l halyards holdin belayin pin lookin white sheet got glance im two three times doorin flashes lightnin 
well stooard lightnin playin round mizzen truck main truck fore truck end flyin jib boom spanker boom came flash seemed set afire entire univarse burst thunder like fifty great guns gone hurry 
identical moment stooard came fore cabin yell beat well rightly say beat minded unfortnit pig got tail jammed capstan cape horn 
father gave gasp 
born says 
like basted growled jim brag 
unfeelin monster brag says though ship carpenter say aven got sympathy fluke anchor hows ever poor father hear remark went heap head legs arms anyhow 
came another yell another half dozen followed another flash lightnin drownded another roar thunder yells kep came strong times makin account whatever whistlin wind rattlin ropes riz easy 
stooard mean tell signifies nothink suppose babby could go life like nary babby even try w ich uttered prophecy cook resumed contemplation bubbling coppers 
well suppose right john johnson said steward 
yes right tom thomson returned cook nod air man never wrong 
cook right reader continues read shall find course time 
gale little robin wright thus launched upon sea time blew sails emigrant ship seahorse ribbons 
also blew masts leaving helpless wreck breast palpitating sea 
blew friendly sail sight passengers crew rescued carried safe back old england 
separated embark emigrant ships renew battle life home thenceforward ever vilify sea aspects except viewed safe distance solid land little robin parents among latter 
father poor gentleman procured situation accountant mercantile house 
mother busied busy little creature economics home 
clothed robin body stored mind 
among things early taught read bible 
robin grew waxed strong bold lively becoming source much anxiety mingled delight mother considerable alarm mixed admiration surprise father 
possessed inquisitive mind 
inquired everything including antique barometer household clock heirlooms improved inquiries 
strange say robin chief delight early days thunderstorm 
rolling heaven artillery seemed afford inexpressible satisfaction little heart lightning affected 
filled species awful joy 
matter came whether forked flashes storm lambent gleamings summer sky would sit gaze solemn wonder 
even earliest years began make inquiries remarkable mysterious agent 
musser said one day thunderstorm raising large eyes mother face intense gravity musser lightenin mrs wright soft little unscientific lady gorgeous eyes sat son perplexed 
well child really know know echoed robin surprise sought know everysing 
everything dear replied mrs wright deprecatory smile comes father tell 
know everysing asked child 
n exactly knows many things oh ever many things answered cautious wife mother 
accountant barely crossed humble threshold sat robin clambered knee put puzzling question 
fasser lightenin lightning boy let see fire course sort comes clouds goes slap earth see robin see awestruck crash followed blinding flash forgot moment push inquiries much father satisfaction internally resolved hunt encyclopaedia britannica evening letter l study 
process time robin increased size 
expanded body developed mind heart little mother although profoundly ignorant electricity effects deeply learned scriptures 
robin hunger vain scientific knowledge 
good fortune cousin cousin sam shipton fourteen years older clerk neighbouring railway station telegraphic instrument 
sam possessed strongly scientific tendencies took great fancy little robin sought enlighten young mind many subjects musser knowledge failed 
course could explain knew electricity child young could introduced one day interior station filled youthful mind amazement admiration rapid apparently meaningless manipulation telegraph instrument 
cousin sam however good deal course time proceeding must turn aside minutes comment wonderful subject essentially connected development tale 
chapter two 
refers notable character 
sparks rule looked upon race useless disreputable fellows 
course usually erratic 
fly upward downward forward backward everywhere 
never know next flight 
often create good deal alarm sometimes much surprise seldom good frequently cause irreparable damage 
caught restrained directed sparks become harmless helpful 
one spark world grand glowing gushing fellow equal anywhere 
old hills perhaps older wide world perchance wider 
similar ordinary sparks respects differs several important particulars 
like many fast immeasurably faster sparks put together 
unlike however submits led master minds 
stronger hercules rend mountains 
fleeter mercury outstrip light 
gentler zephyr assume condition current enter marrow without causing pain 
name electricity 
one knows 
philosophers said fluid flows 
well might call wild horse bolts thief lurks prefer call spark form visible least handled man 
talking last century master minds found catch handle spark 
previous centuries roaming gaily world perfect freedom sometimes gliding silently fro like angel light sometimes leaping forth frightful energy midst raging tempest like destructive demon ripping rending shattering attempted arrest course 
men feared shunned since beginning time good reason killed many human race 
although uncaught untamed spark altogether unknown ancients 
far back year christian era thales one greek sages discovered hid amber substance greek named electron hence name electricity ancients knew little character though thales found could draw hiding place rubbing silk substances 
thus rubbed became attractive drew light creatures towards unlike human sparks also showed fickle holding light creatures tight brief space let go repelled 
till days good queen bess towards end sixteenth century dr gilbert discovered wild fellow lay lurking substances besides amber sulphur wax glass etcetera 
known electricity permeates substances less waits roused order exhibit amazing powers 
fond shocking people feelings surprised pursuers rather frequently way 
indeed actually shocked death would take huge volume give detailed account qualities powers peculiarities wild spark 
touch facts necessary elucidation tale 
great event world history happened year 
nothing less capture imprisonment wild daring dashing electricity 
dutch philosophers belongs honor catching 
caught even bottled like ordinary spirits called prison leyden jar 
date spark became useful obedient slave man 
yet ever ready smallest conceivable door hole chink left open dash prison house man made escape native earth 
hope however escaping altogether resist allurement rubbing well chemical action means summon like genii aladdin lamp moment vasty deep compel work 
sort work may asked volatile fellow perform tell list long 
let us consider 
fabricate tea pots sugar basins spoons anything else base metal bidding cover silver yellow gold 
grow dissatisfied candles gas summoned properly directed master minds owns allegiance kindle lamps fill streets mansions blaze noonday splendor 
grow weary steam give orders drive tram cars locomotives railway speed minus railway smoke fuss 
giant chemist laboratory swift messenger carry world news 
even raging fro wild state half disposed rend mansions split steeples wreck ships provide tiny metal stair case instantly glide upper regions earth without noise damage 
shakespeare never imagined mercury never accomplished speed travels carry news express sentiments wishes far wide land rush rock sand mud ooze along bottom deep deep sea brings us point 
master minds mentioned conceived idea telegraphic communication might carried water set experimenting 
years enterprising men old world new suggested pondered planned placed wires water along spark ran less successfully 
one difficulties experiments consisted spark runs readily along one class substances run along others 
substances first class comprising metals called conductors second class embracing among things resinous substances styled non conductors 
water good conductor 
although spark stick wires insulated telegraph posts land bolt take flight moment gets water 
difficulty overcome coating wires gutta percha non conductor imprisoned spark kept line 
copper wire covered manner successfully laid england france 
tested cable work well 
minute imperfections form air holes gutta percha afforded spark opportunity bolt bolt matter course electricity sense honor trusted near smallest loop hole 
imperfections remedied door effectually locked first submarine cable importance actually laid worked well 
french english believers turned hands eyes delighted amazement held converse across sea unbelievers silenced confounded 
happy state things however lasted hours 
suddenly intercourse ceased 
telegraphists ends energised handles needles without result 
cable dumb 
spark evidently escaped effect without cause 
cause interruption soon discovered 
early morning french fisherman sauntered port boulogne embarked boat 
british seaman nothing smoke meditate seated coil rope time enjoying smells port unfamiliar 
chanced friend french fisherman 
early afloat mounseer said 
oui monsieur 
vill com go feesh 
well wee go fun 
went accordingly bore away northward along coast light breeze past ruined towers france built guard port days gone past steep cliffs beyond boulogne past lovely beach wimereux cottages nestled among sand hills silted harbor whence napoleon first intended issue forth descend perfidious albion past cliffs bays villages brought cape grisnez 
frenchman let trawl fished among curiosities deep submarine cable behold fat dis exclaimed glaring eyes uplifted brows shoulders shrugged hands spread fingers expanded 
sea sarpint grow thin suggested englishman 
non c est seaveed veed de strordinair de vorld 
oui donnez moi de hache de hax mon ami 
friend handed axe wherewith lie cut small portion cable let end go 
little fisherman know also let spark go free cruelly dashed time least budding hopes two nations 
bore prize triumph boulogne exhibited specimen rare seaweed center filled gold telegraph clerks ends sat gazing dismay useless instruments 
thus first submarine electric cable destroyed 
details destruction little robin intimately acquainted cousin sam member staff worked telegraph least boy office years filled cousin mind importance cable grandeur difficulty enterprise robin became powerfully sympathetic much sam telling story came point frenchman accomplished destruction robin used grieve though lost brother kitten latest toy need scarcely add submarine cable telegraphy received death blow occasion 
possibility demonstrated 
next year mr tr crampton messrs wollaston kuper others made laid improved cable dover calais ere long many parts world connected means snaky submarine electric cables 
chapter three 
early aspirations 
one pleasant summer afternoon mr wright coming office seated beside composed little wife patching pair miniature pantaloons 
nan said husband perplexed look robin grows george answered composed wife think rather soon trouble question robin mere child yet 
must first give good education 
course know returned perplexed husband still help thinking done good education 
know relation world except brother richard poor 
influential friends help army navy indian civil service church know suitable imp 
look mrs wright looked window one sunny landscapes usually described smiling across winding rivulet last fixed gorgeous eyes tall post small black object seen struggling 
said father 
seems telegraph post said mother investigating wires doubt 
heard talking telegraphy madge morning retailing cousin sam tries teach wonder endeavoring make sure told correct know thorough investigator 
yes know murmured father grim pursing lips investigated inside watch last week find said made noise stummick intermittent fever ever since 
two days ago investigated razor equal cross cut saw drawers papers excepting lock one word fully describes result investigations chaos 
truth ground father emotions master robin displayed investigative say destructive capacities far advance years 
never mind george said mrs wright soothingly must put little ways best may consoling reflection robin genius perseverance qualities sure make way world 
events made way telegraph post said mr wright smile expanding grimness departing see rascal actually stretching hand grasp one wires 
ha hallo composed wife became suddenly discomposed gave vent scream moment small black object watching much interest seen fall backward make wild grasp nothing hands fall promptly ground 
father threw window leaped dashed across four feet wide lawn cleared winding rivulet cut like hunted hare smiling landscape towards telegraph post foot picked unconscious though much injured son 
made climb post robin asked cousin madge evening nursed adventurous boy knee madge motherly nurse although full year younger robin 
kimed see could hear trissity replied injured one 
lek trissity said madge correcting 
must learn p onounce words popperly dear 
never great man careless 
want g eat man retorted robin 
want understand things whats puzzlesum 
well telegraph puzzle oh mos awfully returned robin solemn gaze earnest eyes one rendered fantastic yellow green ring round swelling underneath 
kite sure stood hours beside dat post listin hummin hummin like olianarp robin careful 
know mamma calls olian harp 
yes well like olian h arp deal louder far nicer 
often said trissity lek robin lek well yes lek trissity 
thought kime see know papa says trissity lek mean runs along wires papa also says interrupted madge sounds want know made vi vi bratin suggested invalid 
yes vibratin wires 
wonder vi bratin means murmured robin turning lustrous though damaged eyes meditatively landscape 
sure said madge think means tremblin 
seen conversation robert wright precocious cousin marjory decidedly philosophical turn mind 
chapter four 
extraordinary result attempt amateur cable laying 
time continued roll additional years reel rolled robin madge length breadth though say much thickness 
time also developed minds robin gradually began understand little nature subtle fluid may venture call influence born 
come madge said one day throwing cap let us go play cables 
madge ever ready play anything put sun bonnet followed ambitious leader 
land telegraphs day submarine cables inquired madge much gravity earnestness world welfare depended decision 
cables course answered robin madge done land telegraphs 
nothing learn 
cousin sam put everything know 
besides mystery land lines 
got stick lot posts insulators screwed em fix wires insulators clap electric battery telegraph instrument fire away 
robin insulators asked madge puzzled look 
madge replied robin self satisfied expression pert face three hundred thousandth time explained 
explain three hundred thousand first time dear robin perhaps take 
well began robin hypocritical sigh despair must know everything nature less conductor electricity things conduct well copper iron called conductors things glass earthenware conduct badly scarcely conduct called non conductors 
ee see oh yes see robin bat see well 
however go 
well run wire posts support electricity would escape posts earth especially posts wet rain water good conductor mister electricity irresistible desire bolt earth like mole 
naughty fellow murmured madge 
continued robin impressively fix little lumps glass hole posts fix wires electricity bolt glass lumps non conductors let pass 
good said madge 
yes see continued robin glass lumps insulators cut electricity earth island events appears cut water mister electricity must go along wires tell 
course know must make electricity first battery often often told trough containing mixture acid water plates slices zinc copper placed one touching 
fix piece wire first copper slice plate end last zinc slice plate immediately electricity begin made fly copper zinc round round plates worn wire broken 
ee see robin see blinder blindest mole 
oh madge wonderful mind must said robin laughing 
simple 
course said madge understand mean troughs plates want know arrangement necessary 
would well tempt electricity hiding hole plates slices cheese bread placed one trough filled mixture glue melted butter stuff talk madge well might ask would make plum pudding nutmegs coal tar 
things fellow understand course know everything astounding modesty latter remark seemed furnished madge food reflection reply 
minutes walk amateur electricians reached scene intended game sequestered dell plantation brawled rather turbulent stream 
one part willow overhung water deep broad pool 
stream entered pool headlong plunge issued riotous upheaval wavelets foam among jagged rocks rejoicing rather boastful previous leap 
game extremely simple 
pool german ocean piece stout cord serve submarine cable 
boy girl well matched playmates madge ignorant receptive reference science robin learned communicative intensely earnest 
battery said robin dug deep hole close pool spade brought purpose 
yes muddy water mixture acid water said madge 
spoke robin toe caught root went headlong battery emerged scarcely recognisable 
severe though electric shock first robin seemed inclined whimper manhood triumphed burst compound laugh yell intense relief madge thought first seriously injured 
never mind madge said robin cleansed muddy head cousin sam often told nothing great ever done except face difficulties dangers 
wonder whether counted difficulty danger first thought danger said madge laugh trouble mud hair looks like difficulty cried robin 
come good beginning 
madge get away round opposite side pool mind slip rather steep 
england cried robin preparing throw line assistant stood eager aid side standing side german ocean sure robin 
holland think denmark 
well say denmark 
look ready catch 
going connect england denmark submarine cable 
stay cried madge way submarine cables laid throwing sea n exactly 
steamboat know carry telegraph england france got steamer even plank make believe one 
cousin sam says good workman work almost tools come hand 
tools improve go work without 
catch robin made splendid heave splendid indeed caused stagger backward stumbled battery time however one leg immersed 
another danger shouted madge great glee caught cable 
right 
make fast shore end bush commence telegraphing 
first must message queen king denmark president king think robin sure 
well matter 
say wrong cable sink 
floating top pool submarine cable know unless sinks 
another difficulty robin 
face overcome madge 
cast shore end soon settle 
fastened number small stones cable persevering electrician would certainly overcome difficulty line thrown unfortunately caught branch willow hung suspended madge reach 
provoking said stretching hand utmost 
take care ha warning came late 
edge bank gave way madge went headlong pool wild shriek fearful plunge 
robin stood rooted spot heart breath blood brain paralysed moment gazing spot playmate disappeared 
another moment head hands appeared 
struggled bravely life circling current carried quickly lower end pool 
robin energies returned afterwards said like electric shock accompanied terrible sinking heart knew could swim education important particular neglected 
sprang round lower end pool time hold hand drowning girl 
almost touched outstretched hand swept towards turbulent waters failed grasp 
first time life little hero called face death voluntarily 
another moment madge would caught boiling stream rushed towards fall 
equal occasion 
sprang right upon madge caught arms 
need hold 
agony fear poor child clasped boy deadly embrace 
whirled violently round hurled rock 
robin caught one hand instantly torn grasp 
waters overwhelmed sent violently towards bank 
time robin caught rock hands held 
slowly almost choked water splashed face worked right knee crevice made wild grasp left hand higher projection rock 
moment left foot struck bottom 
another effort danger several minutes ere succeeded dragging madge hissing water shallows green sward accomplished found almost impossible tear grasp unconscious girl 
first poor robin thought companion dead degrees consciousness returned last able rise walk 
drenched dishevelled depressed unfortunate electricians returned home 
course received mingled joy reproof 
course also forbidden go near pool though prohibition afterwards removed hero ultimately became first rate swimmer diver 
thus frustrated laying first submarine cable england denmark chapter five 
prospects real cable laying robin meets first electrical acquaintances 
circumstances require shift scene date pretty frequently tale 
solicit reader attendance office london 
office dingy 
many offices 
two clerks sitting making faces across desk 
lunatics 
imbeciles idlers 
contrary frequent spells work might throw toils arab ass shade 
fine strapping young fellows pent energies equal anything afflicted occasional periods nothing particular 
two sitting morning busy idleness 
muscular nervous systems rebelling induced much fidgeting many wry faces 
original turned sorrows game little game present see make face hideous shall compelled laugh deep sympathy clerks 
clerk know fires vesuvius raging within necessity exhibiting cool aspect spitzbergen without 
clerks utterly miserable 
contrary use one familiar phrases rather jolly otherwise 
evening far attainable perspective

deep game rap door brought faces suddenly state nature 
come said first clerk 
wipe feet murmured second low tone 
gentleman earnest countenance entered 
mr lowstoft office sir said first clerk descending perch air good requesting visitor name business 
visitor handed card name cyrus field written clerk observing admitted owner inner sanctum mr lowstoft transacted business 
something murmured clerk mysterious look comrade resuming perch 
time nearly replied comrade anxious look clock witching hour sets us free saunter home tea approaches 
know cyrus field said first clerk 
cyrus field demanded second clerk 
ignoramus thy name bob thou art worth bob miserable snob know cyrus field man brought laying great atlantic cable learned fred know glad know 
moreover know nothing whatever cables atlantic otherwise 
blind bat ignorant bigot empty soap bubble wise solomon willing taught 
delicious subject work upon said fred 
well work away returned bob suppose give discourse cables 
say merciful 
overdo frederick 
remember capacity feeble 
careful bob 
well must know year submarine cables tried laid worked less success various parts world 
sir w shaughnessy believe began 
irishmen frequently root mischief anyhow superintendent electric telegraphs india hauled insulated wire across hooghly calcutta produced call electrical phenomena side river 
mr wheatstone brought house commons project cable dover calais 
professor morse america laid cable new york harbor another across canal washington 
also suggested possibility laying cable across atlantic ocean 
colonel colt revolver notoriety mr robinson laid wire new york brooklyn long island correy island 
say fred interrupted bob anxious look walking dictionary dates 
haydn nothing 
give without dates got head dates never could stomach except fresh palm tree 
think lecture without dates would pleasantly original well instructive bob guilty gross innovation time honored custom 
must swallow dates whether like 
say mr walker relation hookey sir none whatever laid wire folkestone steamer two miles shore sent messages 
last 
mr brett laid successfully wrought cable dover calais suggested wheatstone eleven years 
true work long may said beginning submarine telegraphy see like education bob thing slow growth 
done dates learned friend asked bob attempting balance ruler point nose 
quite ignorant chum nearly 
year remember mr frederick n gisborne english electrician made first attempt connect newfoundland american continent cable 
also started company facilitate intercourse america ireland means steamers telegraph cables 
gisborne energetic successful got pecuniary difficulties went new york raise wind 
met cyrus field took matter tremendous enthusiasm 
expanded gisborne idea resolved get company connect newfoundland ireland electric cable 
field rich influential ultimately successful ah would rich fred interrupted bob let fall ruler crash red ink bottle overturned go fred getting interested pardon interruption never mind ink swab 
successful yes eminently 
first roused friends states got new york newfoundland london telegraph company carried line telegraph british provinces across gulf saint lawrence saint john newfoundland miles cost pounds 
came england roused british lion whose aid started atlantic telegraph company fairly began work backed men brett bidden stephenson brunel glass eliot morse bright whitehouse host others 
done day 
cyrus field labored years among preliminaries regular attempt made lay atlantic cable 
failed cable broke lost 
second attempt made successful 
year boy ireland newfoundland married th august first electric message passed old world new small wire distance miles 
triumph field friends short lived soon something went wrong cable th september ceased work 
pity exclaimed bob went smoke 
quite bob 
cable struck work messages sent proved value financial point view one messages sent london morning reaching halifax day directed nd regiment return england said timely warning saved country expenditure pounds 
failure instead damping evidently stimulated energies mr field going america england ever since stirring people far near raise funds necessary another attempt 
gives rest embarked fortune affair moment year grace best doubt induce governor mr lowstoft embark boat 
would seem fred suddenly endowed gift second sight moment door employer room opened mr lowstoft came saying visitor friendly tones deepest sympathy self sacrificing efforts noble work devoted 
bob burst sudden enthusiasm leaped stool opened office door muttered something distinguished visitor passed 
beg pardon said mr field checking say wish good luck sir new cable stammered clerk blushing deeply 
thank lad thank said mr field pleasant smile nod went away 
mr sime said mr lowstoft bob turning door room send young wright 
yes sir replied obedient bob going corner room applying lips speaking tube 
young wright none hero robin grown mature age fifteen 
perched top three legged stool slow intensely earnest manner head turned side side wrote quite evident dotted stroked conscientious care 
sat sturdy little broad shouldered fellow deeply engrossed work oblivious around seemed beau ideal painstaking hard working clerk 
deeply engrossed subject copying invoice failed hear voice fellow clerk although end speaking tube far sat 
listening seconds end tube bob sime repeated summons vigor robin leaped stool though received one favorite electric shocks 
minute later stood presence head house 
robert wright said head pushing spectacles brow shall sorry lose services paused turned papers searching something robin heart sank 
going dismissed done anything wrong unwittingly neglected duty ah resumed mr lowstoft letter friend come slight injury right hand wants smart amanuensis general assistant 
think sending objection 
head paused glancing letter robin ventured timidly state strong objections much satisfied situation work desire change 
mr lowstoft appear listen remarks said suddenly studied science electricity believe yes sir extent answered lad look surprise 
know 
father told tastes studies 
heard mr cyrus field presume indeed said robin brightening efforts atlantic cable laid unfortunately went wrong 
well boy efforts another cable laid year hope sincerely go wrong friend wants assistant one electricians connected new expedition 
would like go robin eyes blazed could scarcely find breath words express willingness father object 
go home ask leave great eastern almost ready sea hasten preparations 
robin stroked dotted day 
fear indeed even left invoice desk unfinished last imperfect 
bursting father house found madge become pretty little slip feminine thread paper seated piano agonising chord hand small compass 
madge madge cousin madge shouted seizing extended little hands kissing musical wrinkles brow like magnet never guess 
attract everybody said madge promptly 
pooh 
magnet attract every body 
two poles know repels bodies 
madge electrified 
indeed electrified robin atlantic cable madge 
well ought able powerfully returned madge laugh tell make bad conundrums 
sure something happened 
mrs wright entering moment son calmed well could sat tell tale talk matter 
think mother father consent think robin going matter lay father heaven 
must show us way go right 
according invariable custom robin mother retired room consider proposal 
thereafter long talk husband result following day hero found train small new portmanteau side new billy cock hat head small new purse pocket remarkably small sum money therein light yet full heart breast 
way nore great eastern lay like antediluvian macaroni eater gorging innumerable miles atlantic cable 
say truth robin breast capacious though size could hardly contain heart day 
dream childhood realized thirsted knowledge 
acquired possible father limited circumstances 
moreover valuable assistance sam shipton become deeply learned electrical science 
longed heart become electrician quite ready need commence sweeper telegraph office come regard desires ambitious accepting lot life quiet contentment taught mother entered clerkship mercantile house perched little sigh doubt yet cheerfully top three legged stool 
stool long attached physically begun regard almost part parcel made mind would stick life 
even sometimes took quaint view matter tried imagine long habit would stick last oblige carry sticking straight behind perhaps even require take bed case sometimes tried imagine would precise effect bedclothes turn one side 
thus life projected gray perspective mental eye 
actually electrician elect way join biggest ship world aid laying greatest telegraph cable world company greatest men universe almost much 
thirsted sympathy 
wanted let feelings cheer life lunatic asylum presented refrained 
rough looking sailor lad age much bigger seat opposite third class 
thought pouring feelings prudence prevented 
saying might result figuratively speaking boiler sailor lad accord opened safety valve 
seems pretty bobbish morning young feller said contemplating vis vis long time critical silence 
bin took much eh beg pardon said robin somewhat puzzled 
pritty considerable jolly say returned lad honest ugly face somewhat blunt gruff manner 
indeed jolly said robin bland smile going help lay great atlantic cable 
wot say demanded lad sudden animation 
robin repeated remark 
well go goin help lay great atlantic cable 
one stooard boys 
may young feller oh electrical staff thought word secretary feeling modesty induced say assistant one electricians 
un demanded lad curtly 
mr smith 
mr smith eh well unusual name smith p r aps condescend first name less three smiths among electricians 
ebenezer smith believe said robin 
ebbysneezer smith eh well upon word smith mixtur never heerd 
know im right dessay 
rum lot altogether 
whether compliment meant great smith family general electrical branch particular robin could guess like ask 
thus far opened heart however began pour contents found ugly sailor lad much sympathetic soul led expect looks 
told name asked companion return 
name oh slagg jim slagg james wants respeckful slagg familiar 
son jim slagg senior 
son best known understands science jinnylology 
much matter runs back adam eve somehow 
called father course make distinction calls jimmy bein respeckful like jim 
name much boast change young feller though robert bad name neither 
pretty well known see somethin 
bin bore great men 
let think robert great fear said robin yet womb time 
ah well matter bin robert great 
anyhow robert bruce king warn skull cracker robert stephenson great engineer livin yet robert devil raither fear must bin bad un must count 
course gave another name short ah robin thought 
well bad name neither 
robin hood know draw long bow deal better worst penny liner ever mended quill 
robin goodfellow though rightly remember exactly 
one shakespeare characters interposed robin 
jus well bin bad fellow know 
name wright right know might bin writer taken quill law 
anyhow long wright course wrong eh young feller jim slagg tickled sudden sally laughed shut little eyes opened enormous mouth fully furnished unbroken set splendid teeth 
thus pleasantly robin away time future shipmate arrived end journey parted jim slagg met ebenezer smith 
energetic electrician instead taking board great eastern took small inn gave tea put rather severe electrical examination anxious hero emerged credit 
robin said examiner free easy yet kindly electrician want instruction many things 
indeed sir said robin regular education science hope direct study shall improve 
doubt boy 
meanwhile big ship ready start time want go works telegraph construction maintenance company see making cable learn write careful account see think 
robin could repress smile 
boy laughing demanded mr smith somewhat sternly 
robin blushed deep scarlet replied pardon sir said write think 
well afraid sir stammered robin write think atlantic cable well see shall require long time indeed pretty large volume 
mr smith gazed hero time uplifted brows shook head slowly frowned nodded slightly smiled 
laughed rather chuckled said well may go told omitting think 
small portion suffice hurry back 
go home make fair copy observations thoughts 
write require 
stay address ah note book 
first name mister wright robin grew two inches taller spot never called mister except jest robert sir replied 
robert ha h call bob 
never could stand ceremony accustom new name quickly perhaps new please sir used robin objection objection course interrupted mr smith robin quite well though little longer matter 
good bye robin think hard 
sometimes hurts digestion good bye 
well ee think ebbysneezer smith electrical toolip asked jim slagg robin encountered station 
wiry subject pose like rest em pleasant gentleman answered robin warmly 
oh coorse 
smiths less 
glorious family 
knows least half dozen em superfine people call slums london 
know half dozen em retorted robin somewhat sharply unrefined people call h aristocracy london 
whew whistled mister slagg gazing robin silent surprise 
whistle implied explained time locomotive whistle took tune intense violence causing rush train two lads like many friends abruptly parted season 
chapter six 
tells hero visit great cable 
robin wright returned home bounding heart 
since electrical appointment become figuratively speaking indiarubber ball sort human squash 
heart bounded feet bounded head fallen also would bounded doubt 
arriving found father elder brother retired sea captain merchant service visit family 
favorite uncle kingdom uncle rik thus name richard abbreviated wright family 
uncle rik old bachelor bald baby many babies 
good humored liberal hearted settled unbeliever world progress 
idolised good old times quite pleasantly scorned present 
robin said grasping hero hands uncle rik grasp joke goin batteries galvanic batteries wires well lad always thought less fool never thought born idiot comes 
yes uncle said robin pleasant laugh used old captain plain language going electrician 
bah pooh electrician exclaimed uncle rik vehemence well set magician 
indeed far short said mrs wright seated tea table husband madge least added true hear wonderful science 
half true interjected mr wright 
true said captain rik firmly 
talk deal stuff nine tenths lies pure fable 
believe electricity believe steam 
batteries boilers bosh uncle deny exist said robin 
course replied captain 
know well maybe better heap telegraph wires rove world like great spiders webs steamboats hummin buzzin ay bu stin ocean like huge wasps pretty mess make among poor old lady day indooced young nephy send telegraphic message husband manchester bein london 
unwillin bein half inclined regard telegraph plant lower regions 
message sent lovin wife hopes home morrow 
reached husband lowerin wife hopes hung morrow 
bad writin useless flourish e turned home hung 
puzzled husband telegraphs reply mistake somewhere right shall back three clock morrow kind love 
ye think reached old lady mistake somewhere night stabbed back cloak two rows killed love 
call successful telegraphing admitted robin laugh thousands messages pass fro daily many like think 
poor wife asked madge anxiously 
repeated rik indignantly though misfortune sympathetic captain gave yell nigh knocked young nephy reason fell flat floor 
came bounced bore away railway station full sail shipped manchester found husband alive hearty pitchin huge beefsteak properly said recovering first surprise big enough two 
objection steamers uncle rik asked mrs wright sure comfortable fast going 
comfortable fast goin repeated old sailor look supreme contempt yes comfortable enough berth near paddles boilers fast goin doubt specially bu st nasty things made iron like kitchen kettles rust knock hole em go clap much safety valves go bah pooh nothin like wooden walls old england 
may take word old salt wooden walls float plough ocean new fangled iron pots sunk blowed atoms 
look great eastern biggest kettle em precious mess made first move tried launch shove sidewise like crab lost rudder gale smashed cabin furniture like bad boy toys 
bah hope may bu sts grand explosion 
sorry bad opinion uncle appointed serve great eastern layin atlantic cable 
sorry hear lad sorry hear 
course hope sake blow voyage though nothin less absurd ship goin wild goose chase 
uncle submarine cables passed period experiment said robin coming warmly defense favorite subject 
consider time first one laid dover calais till fifteen years many thousands miles conducting wire laid along bottom sea many parts world full successful operation moment 
even first atlantic cable laid gutta percha company made forty four submarine cables 
know lad last 
sure bu st course time 
though attempt lay last atlantic cable proved failure continued robin first one one success beginning one deny 
ay long last demanded skipper hitting table fist 
oh please pity tea cups uncle rik cried hostess 
beg pardon sister help getting riled hear younkers talkin stuff 
really suppose said captain turning robin managed lay cable across atlantic exchange messages refused travel days succeed layin permanent speakin trumpet old england noof nland miles less spite gales currents ships anchors insects icebergs whales say nothing great sea sarpints like uncle rik said robin intensely earnest eyes glowing cheeks 
bravo robin believe done give us hand lad 
old sailor red countenance beamed huge smile kindness shook enthusiastic nephew hand 
added say another word iron kettles atlantic cables 
succeed give batteries boilers full credit fail forget remind said would bu st course time 
note book pencil hand robin went next day works telegraph construction maintenance company great cable made 
presenting letter introduction mr smith robin conducted premises clerk impression youthful therefore unusually clever newspaper correspondent treated marked respect 
severe trial robin modesty nevertheless bore manfully pulling note book prepared action 
reader need fear intend inflict robin treatise styled great atlantic cable would wrong leave subject without recording points made deep impression 
cable completed sir said clerk conducted visitor factory nautical miles length 
indeed said robin recording statement solemn gravity great accuracy thought added exact distance ireland newfoundland miles 
right sir allow miles slack inequalities bottom 
cost pounds whole finished weigh tons 
poor robin mind course informed ton weights school felt realized actually signified thought suddenly occurred cart load coals weighed one ton whereupon carts coals leaped suddenly field bewildered fancy 
slightly humorous tendency inherited mother induced drivers whips like number smock frocks mount carts drive capacious hold great eastern 
turned however drove instantly brain came august presence cable 
central core cable part electric force fluid pass old world new vice versa made copper

partikler owner turned yet opinion turn night spoke stooard owner know says better turn berth night get showed morrow 
sleep asked robin hesitation 
never mind young electrician 
business

jeff another lad preparing retire night time laughed robin paid attention thanked friend said rather tired would accept kind offer 
thereafter pulling small bible kept pocket since leaving home went corner read verses knelt pray 
surprise lads expressed eyes said nothing

ye mean interferin wi friend dewotions monkey faced polypus demanded fiercely 
monkey faced polypus replied word delivered right hander might felled small horse 
jim slagg however prepared 
turned head neatly one side let blow pass moment planted knuckles bridge opponent nose sent headlong jeff bunk lay conveniently behind 
jumping furiously skinning shins act stumps rushed slagg leaping lightly aside tripped gave smack left ear passed way keeping lively 
unsubdued stumps gathered made blind rush adversary abruptly stopped jeff called dab nose

laying cable faults fault finding anxieties accidents matters 
come us good reader another different scene upon boundless sea 
great atlantic asleep breast heaves gently slowly like profound sleeper

going well 
complicated looking paying machinery revolves smoothly thread like cable passes stern deep utmost regularity 
shore end cable twenty seven miles length much thicker deep sea portion laid valentia nd july amid prayer praise speech making much enthusiasm part operators spectators 
rd end shore cable spliced main cable voyage begun 
first night passed quietly upwards eighty miles cable gone tank big ship stern ocean bed robin wright unable sleep quietly slipped clothes went deck 
drawing near dawn 
knot electricians others chatting subdued tones one subject filled minds ship 
unable sleep like rest us said ebenezer smith accosting robin reached deck 
yes sir said robin sleepy smile thinking cable much took dreaming fell asleep suddenly turned great sea serpent choked extent awoke thought better get look 
ah boy one cable let sleep 
well looked voyage two sets electricians aboard uncommonly wide awake one set representing telegraph construction maintenance company monsieur de sauty set representing atlantic telegraph company mr varley professor thomson 
former test electrical state cable keep signals shore every hour night day voyage latter watch report whether cable fulfils conditions specified contract 
see smallest fault hitch observed 
mean sir asked robin surprise telegraphing shore kept continually voyage yes boy answered smith 
lengths cable three tanks joined one length telegraphing purpose testing kept shore without intermission moment left ireland began pay 
continued goes well land newfoundland 
tests threefold first insulation know means soundness perfection gutta percha covering prevents electricity escaping wires sea earth secondly continuity unbroken condition conductor copper core throughout whole length thirdly determine resistance conductor meant objection carry messages without vigorous application spur form increased electrical power batteries 
see robin every message sent us shore well every message sent us reply travel entire length cable namely miles every mile distance increases unwillingness resistance increase electrical power batteries proportion distance want send message 
understand think sir exact amount resistance tested mr smith smiled looked earnest face young questioner 
boy said would require fully educated mind understand answer question 
subtleties electrical science explained brief conversation 
study apply books full light subject 
nevertheless although carry subject tell something 
remember testing room showed yesterday darkened room captain state room entrance grand saloon yes sir remember well responded robin room conducting wires ends cable led testing tables curious looking galvanometers testing machines 
returned smith pleased pupil aptitude 
well table stands professor thomson delicate wonderful galvanometer 
instrument ray light reflected tiny mirror suspended magnet travels along scale indicates resistance passage current along cable deflection magnet marked course speck light 
understand robin afraid quite sir 
well matter rejoined smith laugh 
events understand speck light keeps within bounds index going well travels beyond index bolts bounds escape electric current taking place somewhere cable call fault occurred 
ah indeed exclaimed robin casting serious look cable rose tank ran smoothly line conducting wheels dropped stern ship glided sea like endless snake stealthy habits 
added sudden look awe cable break would go bottom course replied smith several hearts would break along 
see two gentlemen conversing near companion hatch yes 
one chief electricians chief engineers 
hearts would probably break position awfully responsible 
heart would break know feel swelling horrible suggestion heart would break robin think sympathetic donkey help 
see stout man bridge captain anderson well heart would perhaps sailor know sailor heart tough break would get pretty stiff wrench 
see gentleman looking paying gear earnestly cyrus field said robin 
yes well heart atlantic cable united matter course two would snap together 
smith young assistant conversing thus facetio scientifically electricians duty testing room watching silent intensity indications instruments 
suddenly exactly eighty four miles cable laid observed galvanometer saw speck light glide end scale vanish speck fire seen glide key hole powder magazine could scarcely created greater consternation disappearance light commotion testing room spread instantly every part ship whole staff electricians roused soon afterwards engines great eastern slowed stopped bated breath anxious looks men whispered fault cable 
fault cable committed mortal sin could scarcely looked horrified 
nevertheless ground anxiety fault moral faults indicated something might end destruction 
testing cable time signalling shore monsieur de sauty concluded fault serious character orders given prepare picking apparatus bow purpose drawing cable back ship defective portion reached cut 
pity sighed robin understood going done feeling words shared every one board less intelligence intensity veterans submarine telegraphy spoke encouragingly treated incident comparatively small matter 
two men war terrible sphinx appointed accompany aid great eastern important mission 
gun fired signals made acquaint occurred fires got boilers picking machinery 
electricians well doctors differ would seem among despite skill experience great difference opinion minds board big ship place fault lay 
thought near shore probably splice shore end main cable 
others calculated indications given tests perhaps twenty forty sixty miles astern 
one scientific gentlemen held far ship another gentleman said much experienced fault finding asserted nine ten miles astern 
doctors thus differing practical engineers busy making needful preparations picking operation involving great risk breaking cable requiring utmost delicacy treatment may easily understood cable payed strain comparatively small whereas picked extra strain caused stoppage afterwards hauling risk sudden risings ship stern ocean swell might moment snap thin line like piece packthread 
first difficulty great danger pass cable stern bow turn ship round enable steam cable hauling 
iron chains lashed firmly cable stern secured wire rope carried round outside ship picking apparatus bows 
cable fathoms water paying ceased nice management required keep ship steady steerage way oh intense interest curiosity wonder robin wright regard varied wonderful mechanical appliances whole affair accomplished cable cut shackles chains allowed go plump sea 
robin heart soul seemed go along expecting event fancied lost ever 
gone exclaimed look horror 
quite said jim slagg stood robin elbow regarding operations quiet look intelligence 
see robin wire rope fit hold big ship holdin 
course stupid said robin great sigh relief see going round bows 
first rope let run ease strain ship swung round brought pulley bow paddles moved return towards ireland begun 
strain although great far breaking point speed slow mile hour considered safe process picking 
patience robin observed mr smith passed way cabin virtue much needed laying cables 
commenced voyage rate one mile hour terminate till get back owld ireland unless find fault 
patience however destined severely tried 
day night slow process went 
meanwhile cable absolutely unworkable despite fault chief engineer mr canning sent message mr glass ireland asking send hawk steamer order might return search defect shore end cable found purposed sacrificing eighty odd miles already laid making new splice shore end starting afresh 
reply received mr glass saying hawk would sent immediately 
accordingly daybreak th hawk appeared services required nine morning cable coming slowly carefully examined foot foot nay inch inch fault discovered joy took place anxiety 
ten quarter miles cable picked fault came inboard strange unaccountable fault turned namely small piece wire forced covering cable gutta percha injure quite destroy insulation

chapter nine 
joys hopes alarms ghosts leviathans take part 
man appreciate feelings one become suddenly bankrupt may understand mental condition board great eastern thus tossed pinnacle joyous hope depths dark despair 
however absolute despair 
cable utterly useless indeed insensate broken 
still blessed possibility picking bringing life 
however scarcely appreciable comfort moment little could seen heard board great eastern save elongated faces gloomy forebodings 
ebenezer smith confreres worked testing room like trojans

look terrible sphinx sea heavy thumping waves burying bows foam slipping along steadily thames steamer 
true sir answered slagg whose admiration hero enthusiastic simple character increased intimacy prolonged whose manner address became proportionally respectful steady little duck great eastern got advantage length see ships rides two waves time instead wobblin em raither think roll bit go along trough seas 
cable go beautiful like long drawn eel consumption hear deep captain said hereabouts yes heard say little short two miles deep got long way sink reaches oozy bed

well beats cock fighting 
say electricity works cable heerd one electrical fellers explaining landlubber evenin electricity could run along wires circuit closed meant say would fly battery travel along wire ever far wire turn right round run back battery 
seems got cable newfoundland run another one back ireland work 
ah slagg would indeed case returned robin discovered important fact earth round globe stand acts part grand conductor

books differ opinions causes nature fact fact 
evident robin looked upon unanswerable argument friend seemed perplexed 
well know said pause believe wonderful electricity fit anything revoloosionising everything afore long indeed 
intelligent reader noted gigantic strides recently made electric lighting late observe slagg unwittingly become almost prophetic time
