course yet sort place work boy engaged correct description warehouse 
sleeping partner firm 
ye know boy sir 
well partner work wide awake pretty good notion going 
lad take would say pounds year sound much sir said willie bluntly take understandin work way ards mind pay first 
good said mr tippet nod approval 
ye think workshop added looking round cherubic smile 
funny place responded willie grin 
funny place eh well daresay lad eyes let tell place deep interest may add without vanity importance 
inventions state bordering less upon completion brought operation modify state society materially many prominent phases 
instance self acting galvano hydraulic engine entirely supersede use steam preventing consumption coal going avert least postpone decline british empire 
able men calculated course couple hundred years coal beds exhausted 
gone calculations detected several flaws corrected show different result namely seventeen eighteen years time ounce coal kingdom mr tippet paused observe effect statement 
willie never heard things thoughtful speculative well waggish turn mind listened open eyes mouth earnest attention mr tippet went frightful consequences state things may conceive rather utterly inconceivable 
owing foundations earth cut away probable present coal districts united kingdom collapse ocean rush several largest counties become salt water lakes 
besides coal grand source national wealth sudden failure entail national bankruptcy 
barbarians europe taking advantage condition pour upon us last spark true civilisation miserable world extinguished last refuge hunted foot persecuted freedom finally swept face earth mr tippet brought saw bench violence dog cat started incontinently legs willie somewhat shaken 
continued mr tippet utterly regardless sensation created wiping perspiration shining head handful shavings william willders may shall prevented adoption galvano hydraulic engine consequent restriction application coal legitimate purposes warming dwellings cooking victuals 
mean bring matter home secretary whenever completed invention however quite perfected 
continued mr tippet becoming enthusiastic observed deep impression explanations making willie stood glaring speechless amazement improved sausage machine converting animal substances excellent sausages 
hold every animal substance less good food sad waste throw away bones hair etcetera etcetera merely substances unpalatable difficult chew 
machine gets difficulty 
cut animal killed put machine hair skin bones blood set motion turning galvano hydraulic fluid 
delicious sausages result twenty minutes 
see dog chips call dwells midst chips shavings sleeps upon chips exactly eat chips lives upon scraps strong resemblance

well could take two animals chips puss put alive killing apparatus instrument effectually away cruel process slaughtering accompanying nuisances slaughter houses butchers put say twenty minutes would ground sausages 
know enemies progress ignorant persons like scoff say similar american machine one end put tree comes end shape ready made furniture 
scoffs cease invention live 
bigoted william 
may good objections inventions great difficulties connected objections answer difficulties overcome 
instrument continued mr tippet pointing huge beam leaned end small apartment speculative effort mine

see partially carried enterprising company city whose enormous vans remove whole furniture drawing room almost stands without packing 
chief difficulty fulcrum difficulty met philosopher old 
heard archimedes william man said could make lever big enough move world could get fulcrum rest 
archimedes weak point 
ought known even get fulcrum would still required another world long lever enable walk end 
way might walked lever occur 
might even ridden along 
come new idea 
let see 
order better see mr tippet dropt piece wood left hand pressed fingers eyes shut earthly objects enable take undistracted survey chambers mind 
returning suddenly investigation exclaimed yes william quite see way perceive dimly possibility archimedes formed lever line rails might run along upper side fulcrum end 
yes sir exclaimed willie become excited entering eagerly patron speculations venting occasional remark height enthusiasm 
thing might done continued mr tippet emphatically small carriage galvano hydraulic principle course might run fro passengers suggested willie 
well passengers assented mr tippet smiling 
course lever would large extremely large 
yes might passengers 
stations along line said willie 
mr tippet knitted brows 
ye yes said slowly 
course lever would long extremely long might necessary stop carriages way 
might breadth sufficient lever plant small side stations 
twenty minutes allowed refreshments suggested willie 
said mr tippet stop could reasonable objection refreshments although probable might find difficult get anyone sufficiently enterprising undertake supply line know lever slip fulcrum fall oh exclaimed willie smash neither danger people falling continued mr tippet might prevented railings run along extreme edges lever 
yes interrupted willie whose vivid imagination unused excitement taken bit teeth run away spikes put em keep little boys swinging em gettin mischief 
oh jolly fun would 
think advertise cheap excursion trains along arkimeedis line mondays toosdays

fulcrum station resumed willie mornin precisely 
stops quarter half way three quarter stations allowin twenty minutes less grub weather permittin 
observations quaint said mr tippet smile great deal truth 
doubt connection ideas especially put sounds little ludicrous come analyze see possibility lever size indicated ancient philosopher erected theoretically thing possible subordinate arrangements line railway stations etcetera would mere matters detail 
might advertised balance lever would regulated arrival train terminus world would rise fact might seen excursionists aid enormous telescopes much better people home return train world would sink ancient level 
would considerable risk doubt continued mr tippet meditatively foolish young men boys getting rails sport bravado falling depths illimitable profundity could bobbies stationed along line interrupted willie tickets put warnin passengers give em money account wotsomedever pain bein charged double fare first offence pitched rails illimidibble pro name second 
tell william said mr tippet suddenly getting bench seizing boy hand talents would wasted office 
come assist workshop 
greatly want intelligent lad use hands way use hands cut piece wood smooth knife

willie looked smiled shook head

willie try quarter hour spent vain attempts threw wood knife exclaiming impossible 
mr tippet smiling cherubically nodding approval said knew impossible lad gave know neat handed persevering choose engage spot come trial week

meanwhile shake hands allow express appreciation noble character brother understand sister letter saved young relative mine midst imminent danger 
good night william come monday next nine clock morning 
willie somewhat perplexed prompt dismissal mr tippet opened door especially long free easy conversation felt however much license mr tippet might permit man stern could resisted impunity although burning know object nature innumerable strange pieces mechanism workshop felt constrained make polite bow depart
