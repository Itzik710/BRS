lady macleod gone alice sat alone hour thinking passed thinking rather two men worthy man wild man whose names mentioned close connection 
john grey worthy man man worthy points far knew 
told 
told also cousin george wild wild 
yet thoughts fear whole kindly towards cousin towards lover 
declared aunt john grey would incapable suspicion would shown objection part arrangements made tour

chapter iii john grey worthy man mr grey answer alice vavasor letter duly sent return post duly received morning lady macleod visit may perhaps taken giving sample worthiness 
dated nethercoats small country house cambridgeshire belonged already spent much time intended live altogether marriage 
nethercoats june 
dearest alice glad settled affairs foreign affairs mean much mind 
home affairs thinking quite satisfactorily arranged 
party interested latter opinion may perhaps undue bias 
touching tour quite agree kate would uncomfortable alone 
fine theory women able get along without men well like fine theories found troublesome first put practice 
gloved hands petticoats feminine softness general homage paid beauty stand way success 
things may perhaps day got rid possibly advantage young ladies still encumbered male companion always found comfort 
quite know whether cousin george best possible knight might chosen 
consider infinitely preferable going upon cards 
danger meeting paynim foes doubt would kill much quicker could would much serviceable liberating dungeons oppressors even stray tigers swiss forests 
doubt punctual luggage 
want kate keep accounts kept 
slow getting glasses water railway stations always keep waiting breakfast 
hold man two ladies tour absolute slave fully enjoy 
simply upper servant privilege sitting table mistresses 
doubts whether cousin fit place thing made 
luckily however neither kate without wills perhaps may able reduce mr vavasor obedience 
home affairs little say letter 
shall course run see start shall probably stay week town 
know ought week idleness yet week happiness 
sooner hour country whole day london 
always feel town much allow anything 
sheer idleness could enjoy feverish idleness one driven expecting gratification never comes never even begins come 
however undergo week say last seven days month shall trust recompense much town doings permit 
home affairs 
say nothing believe understand refrain 
cunningly left imply say arguments avail answer even tell decided 
shall therefore imply nothing still trust personal eloquence success 
rather trust trust hope 
garden going well 
rather short water therefore quite bright hoped preparing untiring industry future brightness 
commands obeyed things morrison always says mistress mean mistress intend 
god bless mistress say send home home flowers fruit house husband soon may delays grievous seem unnecessary 
prayer 
ever always j g give commands alice said sat letter solitary breakfast table 
asked liked things course obliged say 
obliged seem care even care 
first thoughts put letter back envelope reading second time 
opened quickly pausing moment lest suspect fearing see might contents mind full rebuke aunt anticipated almost taught expect 
torn letter open rapidly dashed contents quick eyes 
half moment seen nature reply respecting proposed companion tour completed reading slowly enough 
gave commands repeated though might thereby absolve blame reference possible future accusations might perhaps brought certain circumstances contemplating 
considered letter bit bit taking backwards sipping tea every amidst thoughts 
home house 
husband yet 
spoke engagement though betrothal betrothals used yore though already sort married 
betrothals made days 
still remained certain liberty extricating engagement

thoughts deny 
loved tormented feeling full delight love sprung subsequently 
told come youth love twenty sweeter could afterwards 
something rapture earlier dream could never repeated could never live indeed except dream

pretend condemn place men find fittest energies man earthly consideration induce live elsewhere 
odd differ things 
however brilliant might light would contented hide bushel last recurred matter anxious first opened lover letter 
remembered assured expressed mr grey would condescend object traveling cousin 
condescended 
written matter pleasant joke like gentleman disdaining allude past passages life loved abstaining even expressing anything might taken permission part 
alice words told proposed plan something betrayed tremor thoughts 
studiously striven frame phrases tale might told simple statement though trembling mind wrote 
failed knew failed 
failed read effort failure 
quite conscious felt thoroughly knew noble gentleman last drop blood 
yet yet yet almost feeling disappointment written letter lady macleod anticipated 
next week lady macleod still came almost daily queen anne street nothing said miss vavasor swiss tour questions asked mr grey opinion subject 
old lady course discovered quarrel believed probability quarrel obliged contented 
occasion attempt take alice lady midlothian indeed usual subjects conversation almost abandoned lady macleod visits though constant heretofore long

perhaps improbable alice used diplomatic skill preventing meeting lady macleod lover 
anxious obtain object alice extent opposed views 
lady macleod john grey put forces together might found unable resist joint endeavors 
resolved would rate name day marriage return switzerland may therefore thought wise keep mr grey country till lady macleod gone even though thereby cut time sojourn london four days

man wants horse put anything therefore got horses sell must lie 
go market three hundred pounds expect perfect animal

george asked groom questions felt sure better sell brown horse could 
protest nothing specially amiss brown horse 
towards end preceding season overreached lame sold owner money brains cared wait cure 
gone bad character vague suspicion attached hundreds horses good animals way 
come thus tattersall vavasor bought cheap thinking might make money form action 
found nothing amiss indeed bat smithers 
character went therefore bat smithers thought well knowing 
george vavasor knew much horses men perhaps man dealer veterinary surgeon like men doubted knowledge though subject would never admit doubted 
therefore took bat word felt sure horse wrong 
shall run big wood said george 
make un break sir said bat 
rate ride brown horse said george 
soon settled roebury club overtook 
rush horses road altogether within quarter mile edgehill church close meet 
bat two hunters fell little behind others trotted together

mr grindley popular maxwell turn openly sporting life roebury would decidedly failure 
lives men mr grindley men tolerated daily society others accounted superiors seem many attractions 
yet many men one see almost every set mr grindley inferior mr maxwell banker stone prettyman brewers even mr pollock heavy weight literary gentleman hardly say 
attorney trade rate good brewer many attorneys hold heads high anywhere 
grindley rich man rate rich enough life led 
know much birth believe good maxwell ignorant fool whereas rather think maxwell fool 
grindley made way world maxwell would certainly made banker father banker could bank gone prospered partners better men business friend 
grindley knew better intellect maxwell yet allowed maxwell snub toadied maxwell return 
score riding maxwell claimed held superiority grindley want pluck every one knew maxwell lived freely nerves 
think come outward look men form gait visage one good insignificant 
nature dominion man man singular certain obtained manhood may easily held 
among boys school thing even conspicuous boys less conscience men addicted tyranny weak less prone feel misery disgrace succumbing 
large school remember maxwells grindleys tyrants slaves domineered submitted even personal strength always superior courage gave power command 
intellect thoughtfulness means qualities make men boys lovable 
said many deal boys certain among claim obtain ascendancy spirit within doubt whether ascendancy rather thrust claimed 
think outward gait boy goes far towards obtaining submission fellows 
tyrant boy become tyrant man slave boy slave man outward visage noble mean one changes becomes often mean noble
