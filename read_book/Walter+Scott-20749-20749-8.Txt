introduction st ronan well 
novel follows upon plan different author ever written although perhaps legitimate relates kind light literature 
intended word celebrare domestica facta give imitation shifting manners time paint scenes originals daily passing round us minute observation may compare copies originals 
must confessed style composition adopted author rather tempting circumstance offering novelty compositions avoiding worn characters positions hope rivalling many formidable competitors already deserved honors department 
ladies particular gifted nature keen powers observation light satire distinguished works talent reckoning authoress evelina marriage catalogue might made including brilliant talented names edgeworth austin charlotte smith others whose success seems appropriated province novel exclusively 
therefore sense temerity author intruded upon species composition late practiced distinguished success 
consciousness lost however necessity seeking novelty without much apprehended repeated incursions part would nauseate long indulgent public last 
scene chosen author little drama modern life mineral spring found divisions britain supplied usual materials redeeming health driving away care 
invalid often finds relief complaints less healing virtues spa system ordinary life undergoes entire change removed ledger account books legal folios progresses title deeds counters shelves whatever else forms main source constant anxiety home destroys appetite mars custom exercise deranges digestive powers clogs springs life 
thither comes saunterer anxious get rid wearisome attendant thither come males females upon different principle desire make double 
society places regulated nature upon scheme much indulgent rules world fashion narrow circles rank metropolis 
titles rank birth fortune received watering place without strict investigation adequate purpose preferred situation infers certain degree intimacy sociability time whatever heights may carried understood imply duration beyond length season 
intimacy supposed close time transitory endurance attached watering place acquaintance 
novelist therefore fixes upon scene tale endeavors display species society strongest contrast humorous characters manners may brought bear illustrate less violation probability could supposed attend miscellaneous assemblage situation 
scenes frequently mingled characters merely ridiculous dangerous hateful 
unprincipled gamester heartless fortune hunter eke means subsistence pandering vices follies rich gay drive various arts foibles crimes imprudence acts ruinous madness found victims naturally resort certainty eagles gathered together place slaughter 
author takes great advantage management story particularly darker melancholy passages 
impostor gambler live loose upon skirts society like vermin thrive corruptions found retreats easily matter course mingle dupes might otherwise escaped snares 
besides characters actually dangerous society well frequented watering place generally exhibits amusement company perplexity amazement inexperienced sprinkling persons called newspapers eccentric characters individuals namely either real derangement understanding much frequently excess vanity ambitious distinguishing striking peculiarity dress address conversation manners perhaps 
affectations usually adopted like drawcansir extravagances show dare must needs say profess frequently found among english among natives either two divisions united kingdoms 
reason probably consciousness wealth sturdy feeling independence generally pervade english nation individuals perverted absurdity least peculiarity 
witty irishman contrary adapts general behavior best society thinks part shrewd scot national character unnecessarily draw upon public attention 
rules however without exceptions find men every country playing eccentric independent resorts gay wealthy every one enjoys license good eyes 
scarce needed obvious remarks justify novelist choice watering place scene fictitious narrative 
unquestionably affords every variety character mixed together manner without breach probability supposed exist elsewhere neither denied concourse miscellaneous collections persons afford events extremely different quiet routine ordinary life may often take place 
however sufficient mine rich easily accessible necessary engineer explores mining phrase accurate knowledge country possess skill necessary work advantage 
respect author saint ronan well could termed fortunate 
habits life led much late years least general bustling scenes mingled often society enables observer shoot folly flies 
consequence perhaps characters wanted force precision given writer familiarly acquainted subject 
author however satisfaction chronicle testimony practice gambling vice devil contrived render since deprived whatever pleads apology vices founded entirely cold blooded calculation exclusive selfishness 
character traveller meddling self important ladies call fussing yet generous benevolent purposes partly taken nature 
story entirely modern require much explanation given either shape notes prolix introduction 
may remarked english critics many instances though none great influence pursued saint ronan well hue cry many fraternity giving opinion author exhausted technical phrase expresses written unusual tract success often provokes many persons mark exaggerate slip occur author publicly accused prose verse committed literary suicide unhappy attempt 
voices therefore time saint ronan southern side tweed 
author country otherwise 
many characters recognized genuine scottish portraits good fortune hitherto attended productions author waverley desert notwithstanding ominous vaticinations censurers new attempt although ordinary style
