glade formed tall rose bushes rising one wealth branches tangle thorny shoots big patches foliage caught aloft hung tent like stretching bush bush 
tiny apertures patches leaves suggestive fine lace light filtered like impalpable sunny dust 
vaulted roof hung stray branches chandeliers thick clusters suspended green thread like stems armfuls flowers reached ground athwart rent leafy ceiling trailed around like tattered curtain 
albine meanwhile gazing serge asleep 
never seen utterly prostrated body hands lying open turf face deathly 
dead indeed thought could kiss face without even feeling 
sadly absently busied hands shredding roses within reach 
head drooped enormous cluster brushed hair set roses twisted locks ears neck even threw mantle fragrant flowers across shoulders

watching tender anxiety fearing lest overtire reassured light laugh 
felt strong enough indeed carry whithersoever listed 
found full sunlight drew sigh content 
last lived longer plant subject terrible sufferings winter 
moved loving gratitude within power would spared albine tiny feet even roughness paths dreamed carrying clinging round neck like child lulled sleep mother 
already watched guardian watchful care thrusting aside stones brambles jealous lest breeze waft fleeting kiss upon darling locks alone 
side nestled shoulder serenely yielded guidance 
thus albine serge strolled together sunlight first time 
balmy fragrance floated wake path sun unrolled golden carpet thrilled delight feet 
tall flowering shrubs passed like vision wondrous charm distant paths seemed entreat presence hail murmur admiration even crowds hail long expected sovereigns 
formed one sole supremely lovely 
albine snowy skin whiteness serge browner skin 
slowly passed along clothed sunlight nay sun worshipped low bending flowers 
tide emotion stirred paradou depths 
old flower garden escorted vast field bearing century untrammelled growth nook paradise sown breeze choicest flowers 
blissful peace paradou slumbering broad sunlight prevented degeneration species 
could boast temperature ever equable soil every plant long enriched thrive therein silence vigor 
vegetation mighty magnificent luxuriantly untended full erratic growths decked monstrous blossoming unknown spade watering pot gardeners 
nature left free grow listed depths solitude protected natural shelters threw restraint aside heartily return spring indulged mighty gambols delighted offering seasons strange nosegays meant hand pluck 
rabid fury seemed impel overthrow whatever effort man created rebelliously cast straggling multitude flowers paths attacked rockeries ever rising tide moss knotted round necks marble statues flexible cords creepers threw shattered stonework fountains steps terraces shrubs burst slowly creepingly spread smallest cultivated plots moulding fancy planting ensign rebellion wayside spore lowly weed transformed gigantic growth verdure 
days gone parterre tended master passionately fond flowers displayed trim beds borders wondrous wealth choice blossoms 
plants could still found perpetuated grown numberless families scampering mad fashion throughout whole garden place helter skelter riot walls den debauchery intoxicated nature hiccups verbena pinks 
though outward seeming albine yielded weaker self guidance serge whose shoulder clung really led 
took first grotto 
deep within clump poplars willows gaped cavern formed rugged bits rocks fallen basin tiny rills water trickled stones 
grotto completely lost sight beneath onslaught vegetation 
row upon row hollyhocks seemed bar entrance trellis work red yellow mauve white hued flowers whose stems hidden among colossal bronze green nettles calmly exuded blistering poison 
mighty swarm creepers leaped aloft bounds jasmines starred balmy flowers wistarias delicate lacelike leaves dense ivy dentated resembling varnished metal lithe honeysuckle laden pale coral sprays amorous clematideae reaching arms tufted white aigrettes 
among twined yet slenderer plants binding closely together weaving fragrant woof 
nasturtium bare green skin showed open mouths ruddy gold scarlet runners tough whipcord kindled fire gleaming sparks convolvuli opened heart shaped leaves thousands little bells rang silent peal exquisite colors sweetpeas like swarms settling butterflies folded tawny rosy wings ready borne yet farther away first breeze 
wealth leafy locks sprinkled shower flowers straying away wild dishevelment suggesting head giantess thrown back spasm passion streaming magnificent hair spread pool perfume 
never dared venture darkness albine whispered serge 
urged carried nettles great boulder barred way grotto held moment arms might able peer opening yawned feet ground 
marble woman whispered fallen full length stream 
water eaten face away 
turn wanted look pulled 
cold breeze played upon cheeks 
pale light glided hole saw marble woman lying amidst reeds duckweed 
naked waist 
must drowning last hundred years 
grief probably flung spring slowly committing suicide 
clear water flowed worn face smooth expanse marble mere white surface without feature breasts raised water appeared effort neck still perfect lifelike throbbing even yet joys old delight 
dead yet said serge getting 
one day come get 
albine shuddered led away 
passed sunlight rank luxuriance beds borders 
wandered field flowers capriciously random 
feet trod carpet lovely dwarf plants neatly fringed walks spread wild profusion 
succession passed ankle deep spotted silk soft rose catchflies tufted satin feathered pinks blue velvet forget nots studded melancholy little eyes 
forced way giant mignonette rose knees like bath perfume turned patch lilies valley order might spare expanse violets delicate looking feared hurt 
soon found surrounded sides violets wary gentle steps passed fresh fragrance inhaling breath springtide 
beyond violets mass lobelias spread like green wool gemmed pale mauve 
softly shaded stars globularia blue cups nemophila yellow crosses saponaria white purple ones sweet rocket wove patches rich tapestry stretching onward onward fabric royal luxury young couple might enjoy delights first walk together without fatigue 
violets ever reappeared real seas violets rolled round shedding sweetest perfumes beneath feet wafting wake breath leaf hidden flowerets 
albine serge quite lost 
thousands loftier plants towered hedges around enclosing narrow paths found delightful thread 
paths twisted turned wandered maze like dense thickets 
ageratums sky blue tufts bloom woodruffs soft musky perfume brazen throated mimuluses blotched bright vermilion lofty phloxes crimson violet throwing distaffs flowers breezes spin red flax sprays fine hair chrysanthemums like full golden moons casting short faint rays white violet rose around 
young couple surmounted obstacles lay path continued way betwixt walls verdure 
right sprang slim fraxinella centranthus draped snowy blossoms greyish hounds tongue whose tiny flowercups gleamed dewdrop 
left long row columbines every variety white ones pale rose ones deep violet hues almost black seemed mourning blossoms drooped lofty branching stems plaited goffered like crape 
advanced character hedges changed 
giant larkspurs thrust flower rods dentated foliage gaped mouths tawny snapdragons schizanthus reared scanty leaves fluttering blooms looked like butterflies wings sulphur hue splashed soft lake 
blue bells campanulae swayed aloft even tall asphodels whose golden stems served steeples 
one corner giant fennel reminded one lace dressed lady spreading sunshade sea green satin 
pair suddenly found way blocked 
impossible advance mass flowers huge sheaf plants stopped progress 
mass brank ursine formed pedestal midst sprang scarlet geum rhodanthe stiff petals clarkia great white carved crosses looked like insignia barbarous order 
higher still bloomed rosy viscaria yellow leptosiphon white colinsia lagurus whose dusty green bloom contrasted glowing colors around 
towering growths scarlet foxgloves blue lupins rising slender columns formed sort oriental rotunda gleaming vividly crimson azure summit like surmounting dome dusky copper ruddy leaves colossal castor bean 
serge reached hands try force passage albine stopped begged injure flowers 
break stems crush leaves said 
ever since always taken care hurt none 
come show pansies 
made turn led narrow paths center parterre upon time great basins hollowed 
fallen ruin nothing gigantic jardinieres fringed stained cracked marble 
one largest wind sown wonderful basketful pansies 
velvety blooms seemed almost like living faces bands violet hair yellow eyes paler tinted mouths chins delicate flesh color 
younger used make quite afraid murmured albine 
look 
think thousands little faces looking ground turn direction 
might lot buried dolls thrusting heads ground 
led still 
went round basins 
next one number amaranthuses sprung raising monstrous crests albine always shrunk touching resemblance big bleeding caterpillars 
balsams colors straw colored hue peach blossom blush white gray like flax filled another basin seed pods split little snaps 
midst ruined fountain flourished colony splendid carnations 
white ones hung moss covered rims flaked ones thrust bright medley blossom chinks marble mouth lion whence formerly water jets spurted huge crimson clove shot vigorously decrepit beast seemed spouting blood 
near principal piece ornamental water lake whose surface swans glided become thicket lilacs beneath whose shade stocks verbenas day lilies screened delicate tints dozed away redolent perfume 
seen half flowers yet said albine proudly 
yonder huge ones quite bury amongst like partridge corn field 
went thither 
tripped broad steps whose fallen urns still flickered violet fires iris 
steps streamed gilliflowers like liquid gold 
sides flanked thistles shot like candelabra green bronze twisted curved semblance birds heads fantastic elegance chinese incense burners 
broken balustrades drooped tresses stonecrop light greenish locks spotted mouldiness 
foot steps another parterre spread dotted box trees vigorous oaks box trees carefully pruned clipped balls pyramids octagonal columns revelling unrestrained freedom untidiness breaking ragged masses greenery blue patches sky visible 
albine led serge straight spot seemed graveyard flower garden 
scabious mourned processions poppies stretched line deathly odour unfolding heavy blooms feverish brilliance 
sad anemones clustered weary throngs pallid infected epidemic 
thick set daturas spread purplish horns insects weary life sucked fatal poison 
marigolds buried choking foliage writhing starry flowers already reeked putrefaction 
melancholy flowers also fleshy ranunculi rusty tints hyacinths tuberoses exhaled asphyxia died perfume 
cinerarias conspicuous crowding thickly half mourning robes violet white 
middle gloomy spot mutilated marble cupid still remained standing smiling beneath lichens overspread youthful nakedness arm held bow lay low amongst nettles 
albine serge passed rank growth peonies reaching waists 
white flowers fell pieces passed rain snowy petals refreshing hands heavy drops thunder shower 
red ones grinned apoplectical faces perturbed 
next passed field fuchsias forming dense vigorous shrubs delighted countless bells 
went fields purple veronicas others geraniums blazing fiery tints brasier wind seemed ever fanning fresh heat 
forced way jungle gladioli tall reeds threw spikes flowers gleamed full daylight brilliance burning torches 
lost forest sunflowers stalks thick albine wrist forest darkened rough leaves large enough form infant bed peopled giant starry faces shone like many suns 
thence passed another forest forest rhododendrons teeming blossom branches leaves completely hidden nothing huge nosegays masses soft calyces could seen far eye could reach 
come along got end yet cried albine 
let us push 
serge stopped 
midst old ruined colonnade 
columns offered inviting seats lay prostrate amongst primroses periwinkles 
away among columns still remained upright flowers growing profusion 
expanses tulips showing brilliant streaks like painted china expanses calceolarias dotted crimson gold expanses zinnias like great daisies expanses petunias petals like soft cambric rosy flesh tints gleamed fields flowers could recognize spreading carpets beneath sun motley brilliance softened green leaves 
shall never able see said serge smiling waving hand 
would nice sit amongst perfume 
near large patch heliotropes whose vanilla like breath permeated air velvety softness 
sat upon one fallen columns midst cluster magnificent lilies shot 
walking hour 
wandered flowers roses lilies 
offered calm quiet lovers ramble amid perfumed solicitations luscious honeysuckle musky violets verbenas breathed warm scent kisses tuberoses panted voluptuous passion 
lilies tall slim stems shot round like white pavilion sheltered snowy cups gleaming gold slender pistils 
rested like betrothed children tower purity impregnable ivory tower love yet perfect innocence 
albine serge lingered amongst lilies till evening 
felt happy seemed break new life 
serge felt last trace fever leave hands albine grew quite white milky whiteness untinted rosy hue 
unconscious arms necks shoulders bare straying unconfined hair nowise troubled 
laughed merrily one frank open laughter 
expression eyes retained limpid calmness clear spring water 
quitted lilies feelings children ten years old seemed met garden might friends ever amuse perpetual play 
returned parterre flowers bore discreetly though glad see childishness would nothing might corrupt 
forests peonies masses carnations carpets forget nots curtains clematis steeped atmosphere evening slumbering childlike purity akin longer spread suggestions voluptuousness around 
pansies looked little candid faces like playfellows languid mignonette albine white skirt brushed seemed full compassion held breath lest fan love prematurely life 
viii dawn next day serge called albine

trunks like twisted pillars supporting roof greenery sometimes narrow cloisters sometimes light halls formed verdure swept almost ground left scarcely room pass 
round colossus crowd wild self sown saplings grown thicket like entanglement young shoots 
greenish light filtered like tinted water foliage deep silence mossy soil one heard dull thud fruit culled wind 
patriarchal apricot trees bore great age quite bravely 
though decayed one side showed perfect scaffolding dead wood youthful full life young shoots ever bursting rough bark 
cherry trees formed complete towns houses several stories threw staircases floors branches big enough half score families 
apple trees limbs twisted like old cripples bark gnarled knotted stained lichen growth 
also smooth pear trees shot mast like long slender spars 
rosy blossomed peach trees place amid teeming growth pretty maids amidst human crowd dint bright smiles gentle persistence 
formerly trained espaliers broken low walls supported spread abroad wild confusion freed trammels trellis work broken fragments still adhered branches

tree tree bough bough vine branches hung confusion 
rose like wild laughter twined instant round lofty knot started yet sonorous mirth splotching foliage merry ebriety tendrils 
pale sun gilt green set glow bacchanalianism weather worn heads old orchard giants

near edge stream flowed orchard also grew various kinds melons rough knotty warts smooth shining oval eggs ostriches 
every step progress barred currant bushes showing limpid bunches fruit rubies one sparkled liquid sunlight 
hedges raspberry canes shot like wild brambles ground carpet strawberry plants teeming ripe berries exhaled slight odour vanilla 
enchanted corner orchard still left near tier rocks began soar upwards 
found veritable land fire natural hot house sun fell freely 
first make way huge ungainly fig trees stretched gray branches like arms weary lying still whose villose leather like foliage dense order pass one constantly snap twigs sprouted old wood 
next passed groves strawberry trees verdure like giant box plants scarlet berries suggested maize plants decked crimson ribbon 
came jungle nettle trees medlars jujube trees pomegranates skirted never fading verdure 
fruit latter big child fist scarcely set yet purple blossoms fluttering ends branches looked like palpitating wings humming birds even bend shoots perch 
lastly forest orange lemon trees growing vigorously open air 
straight trunks stood like rows brown columns shiny leaves showed brightly blue sky cast upon ground network light shadow figuring palms indian fabric 
shade beside european orchard seemed colourless insipid warm joy sunlight softened flying gold dust glad certainty evergreen foliage penetrating perfume blossom subdued fragrance fruit helping fill body soft languor tropical lands

happy orchard playful straggling bushes fresh appetising shade wealth old trees laden like kindly grandfathers sweet dainties 
even depths recesses green moss beneath broken trunks compelled creep one behind narrow leafy alleys young folks never succumbed perilous reveries silence 
trouble touched happy wood 
grown weary apricot trees plum trees cherry trees ran beneath slender almond trees eating green almonds scarcely yet big peas hunting strawberries grassy carpet regretting melons already ripe 
albine finished running fast could go pursued serge unable overtake 
rushed amongst fig trees leaping heavy branches pulling leaves throw behind companion face

grass looked soft downy like velvet 
deep green subsiding distance lighter tints horizon assuming bright yellow glow beneath flaring sun 
clumps willows right yonder seemed like pure gold bathed tremulous brilliance sunshine 
dancing dust tipped blades grass quivering light gentle breezes swept free expanse moire like reflections appeared caressed quivering herbage 
nearer fields multitude little white daisies swarms straggling groups like holiday makers public rejoicing brightly peopled dark grass 
buttercups showed gay like little brass bells touch fly wing would set tinkling 
big lonely poppies raised fiery cups others gathered together away spread like vats purple lees wine 
big cornflowers balanced aloft light blue caps looked would fly away every breath air 
foot patches woolly feather grass fragrant meadow sweet sheets fescue dog tail creeping bent meadow grass

joy great came three streams 
first flowed bed pebbles two rows willows closely planted grope branches risk falling deep part water 
rose serge knees however caught albine arms carried opposite bank save wetting 
next stream flowed black shade beneath lofty canopy foliage passing languidly onward gentle rustling rippling satin train lady dreamily sauntering woodland depths 
deep cold rather dangerous looking stream fallen tree stretched bank bank served bridge 
crossed bestriding tree dangling feet first amusing stirring water looked like mirror burnished steel suddenly hastening frightened strange eyes opened depths sleepy current slightest splash

morrow settled would go far end park pay visit great forest trees serge yet seen 
albine refused take anything along 
breakfasted starting set till late 
heat sun great brought feeling languor sauntered along gently side side seeking every patch sheltering shade 
lingered neither garden orchard pass 
gained shady coolness beneath big trees dropped still slower pace without word deep sigh though welcome relief escape glare day pushed forest depths 
nothing cool green leaves glimpse sunlit expanse afforded gap foliage looked smiled feeling vague uneasiness 
nice murmured serge 
albine simply nodded head 
choking sensation throat prevented speaking 
arms passed usual round waist swung loosely sides 
walked along without touching heads inclined towards ground

serge began laugh offered help search 
conducted gently order might alarm saw even yet trembling though resumed slow walk beside 
contemplating forbidden could bring luck like felt delightful awe thrilled repeated sigh forest trees 
perfume foliage soft green light filtered leaves soughing silence undergrowth filled tremulous excitement though next turn path might lead perilous happiness 
hours walked cool trees 
retained reserved attitude towards scarcely exchanged word though never left side went together darkest greenery forest 
first way lay jungle saplings trunks thicker child wrist 
push aside open path tender shoots threw wavy lacework foliage eyes 
saplings closed behind leaving trace passage struggled random ignorant might leaving nothing behind mark progress save momentary waving shaken boughs 
albine weary unable see three steps front delighted last found free jungle whose end long tried discover 
reached little clearing whence several narrow paths fringed green hedges struck various directions twisting hither thither intersecting one another bending stretching capricious fashion 
albine serge rose tip toes peep hedges haste would willingly stayed lost mazy windings without ever getting anywhere seen proud lines lofty forest trees 
passed last beneath shade solemnly touch sacred awe one enters vaulted cathedral 
straight lichen stained trunks mighty trees dingy gray like discolored stone towered loftily line line like far reaching infinity columns 
naves opened far away lower narrower aisles naves strangely bold proportions whose supporting pillars slender richly caned finely chiselled everywhere allowed glimpse blue heavens 
religious silence reigned beneath giant arches ground lay hard stone austere nakedness blade green nought ruddy dust dead leaves 
serge albine listened ringing footsteps went thrilled majestic solitude temple 
indeed anywhere must much sought tree beneath whose shade perfect happiness made home 
felt nigh delight stole amidst dimness mighty arches 
trees seemed creatures kindliness full strength silence happy restfulness 
looked one one loved awaited majestic tranquillity revelation whereby might grow expand bliss strong perfect life 
maples ashes hornbeams cornels formed nation giants multitude full proud gentleness lived peace knowing fall one would sufficed wreck whole corner forest 
elms displayed colossal bodies limbs full sap scarce veiled light clusters little leaves 
birches alders delicate sylphs swayed slim figures breeze surrendered foliage streamed around like locks goddesses already half metamorphosed trees 
planes shot regularly glossy tattooed bark whence scaly fragments fell 
gentle slope descended larches resembling band barbarians draped sayons woven greenery 
oaks monarchs mighty oaks whose sturdy trunks thrust conquering arms barred sun approach around titan like trees oft lightning struck thrown back postures like unconquered wrestlers scattered limbs alone gave birth whole forest 
could tree serge albine sought one colossal oaks one lovely planes one pale maidenly birches one creaking elms albine serge still plodded unable tell completely lost amongst crowding trees 
moment thought found object quest midst group walnut trees whose thick foliage fell cold shadow shivered beneath 
felt another thrill emotion came upon little wood chestnut trees green moss thrusting big strange shaped branches one might built aerial village 
still albine caught sight clearing whither ran hastily 
midst carpet fine turf locust tree set toppling greenery foliaged babel whose ruins covered strangest vegetation 
stones sucked ground mounting sap still remained adhering trunk 
high branches bent earth taking root surrounded parent tree lofty arches nation new trunks ever increased multiplied 
upon bark seared bleeding wounds ripening fruit pods mere effort bearing fruit strained old monster skin split 
young folks walked slowly round passing arched branches formed streets city stared gaping cracks naked roots 
went felt supernatural happiness sought 
asked serge 
albine know

grove cytisus acacias whose clustering blossoms fell soft almost sugary perfume 
quite lost laughed

serge quite close murmured little time ago afraid 
looked straight face perfectly calm without least faltering glance 
hurt replied different 
afraid let hold like

passed arm round waist thus sauntered back shade great forest trees whose arching vaults slowly went love awakening within 
albine said felt little tired rested head serge shoulder

love said serge breath stirred golden hair clustered round albine temples 
tried think words could repeat love love albine listened delightful smile upon face

moment two remained silent enraptured 
seemed soft flute like music went words came dulcet orchestra could see 
shorter shorter became steps leaned one towards ever threading way amidst mighty trees 
afar long vista colonnades glimpses waning sunlight showing like procession white robed maidens entering church betrothal ceremony amid low strains organ 
love asked albine 
smiled answer immediately said love came

one fine day becomes clear bursts 
see nothing trouble love one another love life one 
albine head cast back eyes tightly closed scarce drew breath 
serge caressing words enraptured really really love murmured without opening eyes 
serge remained silent sorely troubled could find nothing say prove force love 
eyes wandered rosy face lay upon shoulder restfulness sleep 
eyelids soft silk 
moist lips curved bewitching smile brow pure white rim gold hair 
would liked give whole word seemed upon tongue could utter 
bent seemed consider sweet spot fair face whisper supreme syllables 
said nothing breathed little sigh 
kissed albine lips 
albine love love serge stopped short thrilled quivering first love kiss 
opened eyes quite widely

tell long loved

always loved 
love evening closed round lived upon one word love ever seemed find new sweetness 
brought every sentence ejaculated inconsequentially merely pleasure found pronouncing 
serge however think pressing second kiss albine lips 
perfume first sufficed purity 
found way rather stumbled upon paid attention paths took 
left forest twilight fallen moon rising round yellow black foliage 
delightful walk home park discreet luminary peering gaps big trees 
albine said moon surely following 
night balmy warm stars 
far away long murmur rose forest trees serge listened thinking talking us 
reached parterre passed atmosphere sweetest perfumes perfume flowers night richer caressing day seems like breath slumber 
good night serge 
good night albine 
clasped hand landing first floor without entering room usually wished good night 
kiss 
serge alone remained seated edge bed listening albine every movement room 
weary happiness happiness benumbed limbs 
xii next days albine serge experienced feeling embarrassment 
avoided allusion walk beneath trees 
kissed repeated confession love 
feeling shame sealed lips rather fear way spoiling happiness 
apart lived upon dear recollection love awakening plunged passed happy hours spent arms around waist faces close together 
ended throwing feverish state 
looked heavy eyes talked melancholy mood things interest least 
long interval silence serge would say albine tone full anxiety ill shook head answered 
well hands burning 
thought park filled vague uneasiness could understand 
felt danger lurked path would seize hurt 
never spoke disquieting thoughts certain timid glances revealed mutual anguish held apart though foes 
one morning however albine ventured much hesitation say serge wrong keep always indoors 
fall ill 
serge laughed rather embarrassed way 
bah muttered everywhere know garden heart 
albine shook head whisper replied know rocks never springs 
warmed last winter 
nooks stones seem actually alive 
next morning without said another word subject set together 
climbed left behind grotto marble woman lay slumbering set foot lowest stones serge remarked must see everything 
perhaps shall feel quieter afterwards 
day hot thunder air 
ventured clasp waist stepped along one behind glowing beneath sunlight 
albine took advantage widening path let serge go front warmth breath upon neck troubled 
around rocks arose broad tiers storeys huge flags bristling coarse vegetation 
first came upon golden gorse clumps sage thyme lavender balsamic plants sour berried juniper trees bitter rosemary whose strong scent made dizzy 
path hemmed holly grew quaint forms like cunningly wrought metal work gratings blackened bronze wrought iron polished copper elaborately ornamented covered prickly rosaces 
reaching springs pass pine wood 
shadow seemed weigh upon shoulders like lead 
dry needles crackled beneath feet throwing light resinous dust burned lips 
garden make agreeable said serge turning towards albine 
smiled 
near edge springs 
sight clear waters brought relief 
yet springs hide beneath covering verdure like bubble plains set thick foliage growing around may slumber idly shade 
shot full light day cavity rock without blade grass near tinge clear water green 
steeped sunshine looked silvery 
depths sun beat sand breathing living dust light 
darted basin like arms purest white rebounded like nude infants play suddenly leapt waterfall whose curve suggested woman breast 
dip hands cried albine water icy cold bottom 
indeed able refresh hot hands 
threw water faces lingered amidst spray rose streaming springs 
look cried albine look garden meadows forest 
moment looked paradou spread beneath feet 
see added least sign wall 
whole country belongs us right sky 
time almost unawares slipped arms round waist 
coolness springs soothed feverish disquietude 
going away albine seemed recall something led serge back saying rocks long time ago saw wall 
nothing seen replied serge turning little pale 
yes yes must behind avenue chestnut trees side bushes 
feeling serge arm tremble added perhaps mistaken yet seem remember suddenly came upon left avenue 
stopped way high felt little afraid 
steps farther came upon another surprise 
huge hole could see whole country outside 
serge looked entreaty eyes 
gave little shrug shoulders reassure went stopped hole told quite alone 
stopped 
knife cut brambles rolled big stones 
would defy even sparrow force way 
like go look one days satisfied 
shook head 
went away together still holding waist grown anxious 
serge gazed askance albine face felt perturbed beneath glance 
would liked go thus escape uneasiness longer walk 
spite though impelled stronger power skirted rocky cliff reached table land found intoxication full sunlight 
longer inhaled soft languid perfumes aromatic plants musky scent thyme incense lavender 
treading foul smelling growth foot wormwood bitter penetrating smell rue reeked like putrid flesh hot valerian clammy aphrodisiacal exudations 
mandragoras hemlocks hellebores dwales poured forth odours made heads swim till reeled tottered one 
shall hold serge asked albine felt leaning heavily upon 
already pressing arms struggled grasp drew long breath 
stifle said 
leave alone 
know matter 
ground seems give way feet 
feel pain 
took hold hand laid upon breast 
serge turned quite pale 
even overcome 
tears eyes saw thus ill troubled unable think remedy evil fallen upon 
going die mysterious suffocating faintness come sit shade said serge 
plants poisoning us noxious odours 
led gently along finger tips shivered trembled touched wrist 
beneath fine cedar whose level roof like branches spread nearly dozen yards around seated 
behind grew various quaint conifers cypresses soft flat foliage looked like heavy lace spruce firs erect solemn like ancient druidical pillars still black blood sacrificed victims yews whose dark robes fringed silver evergreen trees kinds thick set foliage dark leathery verdure splashed yellow red 
weird looking araucaria stood strangely large regular arms resembling reptiles grafted one bristling imbricated leaves suggested scales excited serpent 
heavy shade warm air lulled one voluptuous drowsiness 
atmosphere slept breathless perfume eastern love perfume came painted lips shunamite exhaled odorous trees 
going sit said albine 
slipped little aside make room serge stepped back remained standing 
renewed request dropped upon knees little distance away said softly feverish even make hot 
afraid hurting would take arms clasp tightly longer feel pain 
dragged nearer knees 
oh arms night awake dreams see near alas ever far away 
seems wall built us never beat 
yet quite strong could catch arms swing shoulder carry though belonged 
let sink upon elbows attitude deep adoration 
breathed kiss upon hem albine skirt 
girl sprang though received kiss 
hid brow hands perturbed quivering stammering forth beg 
let us go 
hurry away let serge follow walked slowly stumbling roots plants hands still clasped round head though check excitement thrilled 
came little wood took steps ledges rocks whole nation ardent fleshy plants squatting 
like crawling writhing assemblage hideous nameless monsters people nightmare monsters akin spiders caterpillars wood lice grown gigantic proportions bare glaucous skins others tufted filthy matted hairs whilst many sickly limbs dwarf legs shrivelled palsied arms sprawling around 
displayed horrid dropsical bellies spines bossy hideous humps others looked like dislocated skeletons 
mamillaria threw living pustules crawling swarm greenish tortoises bristling hideously long hairs stiffer iron 
echinocacti showed flesh suggested nests young writhing knotted vipers 
echinopses mere excrescent red haired growths made one think huge insects rolled balls 
prickly pears spread fleshy leaves spotted ruddy spikes resembled swarms microscopic bees 
gasterias sprawled like big shepherd spiders turned backs long speckled striated legs 
cacti cereus family showed horrid vegetation huge polyps diseases overheated soil maladies poisoned sap 
aloes languidly unfolding hearts particularly numerous conspicuous 
among one found every possible tint green pale green vivid yellowish green greyish browny green dashed ruddy tone deep green fringed pale gold 
shapes leaves varied tints 
broad heart shaped others long narrow like sword blades bristled spikey thorns yet others looked though cunningly hemmed edges 
giant ones lonely majesty flower stalks towered aloft like poles wreathed rosy coral tiny ones clustering thickly together one stem throwing forth sides leaves gleamed quivered like adders tongues 
let us go back shade begged serge 
sit lie feet talk 
stood sun rays fell like torrential rain 
triumphant orb seized upon shadowless ground strained blazing breast 
albine grew faint staggered turned serge support 
moment felt touch fell together without even word 
though rock beneath opened though ever going 
hands sought caressingly embracingly keen anguish experience suddenly tore apart fled different direction 
serge cease running till reached pavilion thrown upon bed brain fire despair heart

every moment day delighted afresh expression ever varying 
early morning pale maiden risen slumber noon flushed radiant longing fruitfulness evening became languid breathless keen enjoyment 
countenance constantly changing 
particularly evenings hour parting delight 
sun hastening towards horizon ever found fresh smile 
sometimes disappeared midst serene calmness unflecked single cloud sinking gradually beneath golden sea 
times threw crimson glories tore vaporous robe shreds set amidst wavy flames streaked skies like tails gigantic comets whose radiant heads lit crests forest trees 
extinguishing rays one one would softly sink rest shores ruddy sand far reaching banks blushing coral night would glide away demurely behind heavy cloud figured gray hangings alcove eye could detect spark like night light 
else would rush couch tumult passion rolled round white forms gradually crimsoned beneath fiery embraces finally disappeared horizon confused chaos gleaming struggling limbs 
plants made submission 
albine serge passed like monarchs kingdom animals rendered humble loyal obeisance 
crossed parterre flights butterflies arose delight eyes fan quivering wings follow train like living sunbeams flying blossoms 
orchard greeted birds banqueted fruit trees 
sparrows chaffinches golden orioles bullfinches showed ripest fruit scarred hungry beaks sat astride branches breakfasted birds twittered sported round like children play even purloined fruit beneath feet 
albine found even amusement meadows caught little green frogs eyes gold lay squatting amongst reeds absorbed contemplation serge piece straw poked crickets hiding places tickled grasshoppers make sing 
picked insects colors blue ones red ones yellow ones set creeping upon sleeve gleamed glittered like buttons sapphire ruby topaz 
mysterious life streams gray backed fishes threaded dim waters eels whose presence betrayed slight quivering water plants young fry dispersed like blackish sand slightest sound long legged flies water beetles ruffled circling silvery ripples stagnant surface pools silent teeming life drew water impelled dabble stand might feel millions existences ever ever gliding past limbs 
times day hot languid would betake beneath voiceful shade forest listen serenades musicians clear fluting nightingales silvery bugle notes tomtits far accompaniment cuckoos 
gazed delight upon swift flight pheasants whose plumes gleamed like sudden sun rays amidst branches smile stayed steps let troop young roebucks bound past else couple grave stags slackened pace look 
days would climb amongst rocks sun blazing heavens find pleasure watching swarms grasshoppers sound footsteps arose great crepitation wings beds thyme 
snakes lay uncoiled beneath parched bushes lizards sprawled red hot stones watched friendly eyes 
life thus teemed round park albine serge become really conscious since day kiss awakened life 
deafened times spoke language understand 
life voices animal creation perfumes soft shadows flowers trees perturbed point make angry one another 
yet throughout whole park found nothing loving familiarity 
every plant every creature friend

king garden father forest pride plants beloved sun whose earliest latest beams smiled daily crest 
green vault poured joys creation fragrance flowers music birds gleams golden light wakeful freshness dawn slumbrous warmth evening twilight 
strong sap burst bark bathing tree powers fruitfulness making symbol earth virility 
presence sufficed give clearing enchanting charm 
trees built around impenetrable wall isolated sanctuary silence twilight 
greenery scrap sky glimpse horizon nothing swelling rotunda draped green silkiness leaves adorned mossy velvet 
one entered liquid crystal source greenish limpidity sheet silver reposing beneath reflected reeds 
colours perfumes sounds quivers vague indeterminate transparent steeped felicity amidst everything seemed faint away 
languorous warmth glimmer summer night fades bare shoulder fair girl scarce perceptible murmur love sinking silence lingered beneath motionless branches unstirred slightest zephyr 
hymeneal solitude chamber nature lay hidden embraces sun 
albine serge stood ecstasy joy 
soon tree received beneath shade felt eased anxious disquiet long distressed 
fears made avoid fierce wrestling spirit torn wounded without consciousness part really contending vanished left perfect peace 
absolute confidence supreme serenity pervaded yielded unhesitatingly joy together lonely nook completely hidden outside world

garden planned willed 
weeks weeks favoring encouraging passion last supreme day lured spot became tempter whose every voice spoke love 
flower beds amid fragrance languid blossoms wafted soft sighing told weddings roses love joys violets never heliotropes sent forth voluptuous perfume 
mingled soft air arose orchard exhalations ripe fruit vanilla apricots musk oranges luscious aroma fruitfulness 
meadows came fuller notes million sighs sun kissed grass multitudinous love plaints legions living things softened refreshing caresses rivulets whose banks willows palpitated desire 
forest proclaimed mighty passion oaks 
high branches sounded solemn music organ strains like nuptial marches ashes birches hornbeams planes bushes young coppices arose noisy mirth like youthful lovers chasing one another banks hollows amid much crackling snapping branches

grasshoppers grew faint passion chants butterflies scattered kisses beating wings 
amorous sparrows flew mates rivers rippled loves fishes whilst depths forest nightingales sent forth pearly voluptuous notes stags bellowed love aloud 
reptiles insects every species invisible life every atom matter earth joined great chorus 
chorus love nature chorus whole wide world sky clouds radiant rapture two children love revealed eternity life
