let us talk noblemen gentlemen west upon rely join banner soon spread least say word betray 
two days later sir thomas tresham started journey queen remained amboise eagerly awaiting news warwick collected fleet ready set sail 
point duke clarence sided warwick brother passed france believing doubt earl succeed dethroning edward intended place son law upon throne 
rudely awakened delusion charles burgundy open rebellion suzerain king france kept intimately acquainted going 
despatched female emissary clarence inform league warwick made lancastrians intended marriage daughter anne young prince imploring reconciled brother break alliance earl point waging war house york 
clarence took advice went england made peace edward easily king entirely given pleasure treated contempt warnings duke burgundy sent intended invasion warwick 
yet moment serious reflection shown position precarious 
crushing exactions tax gatherers order provide means edward lavish expenditure already caused serious insurrections various parts country unpopularity deep general 
one risings royal troops suffered crushing defeat 
earl rivers father sir john woodville one brothers queen earl devon captured rebels three beheaded throne saved intervention warwick 
thus edward every reason fearing result earl appear arms 
took however measures whatever prepare coming storm although duke burgundy despatched fleet blockade harfleur warwick fitting expedition actually sent name port earl intended land fleet managed escape harfleur edward continued carelessly spend time pleasure dissipation bestowing full confidence upon archbishop york marquis montague brothers earl warwick 
elements favored enemies early september duke burgundy fleet harfleur dispersed storm warwick soon gale abated set sail th landed devonshire coast 
force considerable one french king furnished money men effecting landing found army assembled oppose 
hours disembarkation joined sir thomas tresham gave good news whole west ready rise days great landowners would join retainers 
turned case warwick great array marched eastward 
kent already risen london declared king henry 
warwick therefore instead marching thither moved towards lincolnshire edward army gone north repress insurrection broken instigation warwick 
lord montague threw mask declared king henry 
soldiers followed edward finding hopeless oppose warwick force within short march took ship friends remained faithful sailed holland 
warwick returned london took king henry dungeon tower five years thrown proclaimed king 
day took place dame tresham arrived london son 
queen found could present cross waiting large french force accompany 
uncertain long delay might last counselled friend join husband 
revolution accomplished without loss single life exception earl worcester hated cruelty people 
edward principal friends took refuge various religious houses 
queen three daughters mother fled sanctuary westminster 
left unmolested step taken adherents house york 
warwick virtually king england 
king whose intellect always weak almost imbecile margaret anjou still detained france 
sir thomas tresham went estates kent lived quietly months 
duke clarence joined warwick soon saw brother cause lost duke knowledge changed feelings towards heartily welcomed 
act settlement passed parliament entailing crown henry son edward prince wales case prince death without issue duke clarence 
th march following edward suddenly appeared fleet secretly supplied duke burgundy sailing north landed humber 
found northern population means disposed aid upon taking solemn oath designs whatever upon throne simply claimed restored rights dignities duke york joined sufficient force enable cross trent 
marched south army speedily swelled joined many great lords 
warwick summoned henry adherents field marched north meet 
armies approached duke clarence commanded portion henry army went whole force edward warwick longer position give battle obliged draw allow edward march unopposed towards london 
citizens usual fickleness received outburst enthusiasm five months greeted entry warwick 
unfortunate king henry thrown dungeon tower edward found king england 
sir thomas tresham soon heard landing edward hastened london 
uncertainty matters would go brought wife son left lodgings marched north warwick 
soon defection clarence opened road london left earl promising return days rode town arriving two days edward entry purchasing another horse took wife son st albans leaving rejoined warwick 
days latter gathered sufficient forces enable risk fortunes battle marching south encamped army common north barnet 
edward come meet two armies slept easter eve within two miles 
late evening clarence sent messenger earl offering mediate offer indignantly refused warwick 
darkness neither party aware precise position 
warwick much stronger king artillery placed right wing 
king ignorance enemy position placed troops considerably right warwick army 
latter believing edward line facing kept heavy cannonade night upon supposed edward left cannonade thus entirely futile 
morning april th heavy mist covered country prevented either force seeing dispositions 
warwick took command left wing duke exeter 
somerset command center montague oxford right 
edward placed center array duke gloucester commanded right lord hastings left 
desirous inferiority artillery fight battle hand hand edward six clock morning ordered trumpets blow firing shots advanced mist attack enemy 
misconception warwick position saved troops effects cannonade night disadvantageous earl right greatly outflanked left came contact hastings found nearly surrounded vastly superior force 
wing fought valiantly length broken oxford superior numbers driven field 
mist prevented rest armies knowing happened king left 
edward led charge warwick center best troops command pressed forward force vehemence pierced somerset lines threw confusion 
warwick right outflanked king left left outflanked gloucester 
warwick troops fought great bravery spite disaster center holding ground oxford returning pursuit king left came back mist 
king emblem sun oxford star streaming rays 
dim light mistaken warwick men king device believing oxford far away right received discharge arrows 
returned conflict took place 
last mistake discovered confusion caused irreparable 
warwick oxford suspected treachery king right still pressing confusion increased battle nearly earl soon became complete defeat ten morning warwick army full flight 
accounts differ strength forces engaged probable great inequality party brought fifteen thousand men field 
number slain also uncertain historians placing total ten thousand others low one thousand number nobles fell former computation probably nearest truth 
warwick brother montague many nobles gentlemen killed great nobles side escaped earls somerset oxford many also killed edward side slaughter among ordinary fighting men greater usual 
hitherto battles fought civil war leaders taken field frequently executed common soldiers permitted return homes acting orders feudal superiors considered responsible acts 
barnet however edward smarting humiliation suffered enforced flight england owing whole country declaring rival gave orders quarter granted 
anxious day st albans many ladies whose husbands warwick army like dame tresham taken quarters 
miles field battle 
event victory could join husbands case defeat could take refuge sanctuary abbey 
messengers night brought news battle would begin dawn day intense anxiety waited news 
dame tresham son attended early mass abbey returned lodgings sir thomas rode full speed 
armor dinted plume shorn away helmet 
entered house met wife run downstairs heard horse stop door 
glance face sufficient tell news 
lost day said 
warwick montague killed 
lost present 
love ride west queen margaret speedily land indeed landed already take sanctuary boy go said 
would vastly rather 
tell road said 
time lost 
woman house called set son saddle horse give feed knight 
dame tresham busied packing saddlebags husband partook hasty meal ten minutes arrival set gervaise riding behind father latter led horse wife mounted 
thick mist hung country 
mist told us battle wife advanced forces fell confusion friend attacked friend believing enemy 
however proved advantage us enabled great numbers escape might otherwise followed cut 
fortunate 
left horse little farmhouse two miles rear camp fog small hope finding soon leaving battlefield came upon rustic hurrying direction upon questioning turned hand farm left horse 
two three others stolen midnight see battle making way home seen indeed little learned fugitives defeated 
guided farmhouse otherwise assuredly never reached 
master favourable party let man take one cart horses rode guide placed upon high road st albans able gallop full speed 
warwick brother montague killed 
great earl make unmake kings 
curse england boundless ambition vast possessions readiness change sides embroil country civil war purely personal ends 
great nobles curse country wife 
true check upon kingly ill oppression great arrays retainers feudal followers way methinks citizens yeomen would able hold king 
battle hard fought one know little passed except near standard warwick 
fighting fierce indeed earl king finally directed chief onslaught 
doubtless actuated deep personal resentment earl part played humiliation inflicted upon also knowledge defeat warwick personally would heaviest blow could inflict upon cause lancaster 
think cause lost say 
pembroke strong force wales west rises queen margaret landing join may yet prevail fear news field barnet deter many joining us 
men may risk lands lives cause seems offer fair prospect success hardly blamed holding back see chances 
moreover frenchwoman denied margaret never popular england arrival aided french gold surrounded frenchmen tell country people 
went far could day left amboise urging account come hither matters settled 
would infinitely better young prince come alone landed west without single follower 
people would admired trust would sure gathered strongly round banner 
however must still hope best 
fortune us today may us next time give battle 
parties equally divided throughout country signal victory would bring vast numbers banners edward would find necessary cross seas 
chapter ii battle tewkesbury riding fast sir thomas tresham crossed thames reading news battle barnet arrived 
third day leaving st albans reached westbury heard news received queen landing plymouth day friends defeated barnet already joined duke somerset earl devon others exeter named point rendezvous friends 
lancastrians majority wiltshire somerset longer fear arrest partisans york resting day sir thomas tresham rode quietly exeter queen already arrived 
battle barnet reality greatly weakened lancastrian cause 
earl warwick detested adherents red rose comparatively joined fight rather two sections yorkists york lancaster 
earl death broken party york lancaster face face without disturbing influence either side 
among joined queen tresham great friend grand prior st john sir thomas took lodgings house established 
queen greatly pleased arrival dame tresham earnest request latter shared apartments gervaise remained father 
young knight st john prior said evening arrival sir thomas 
would tresham present rhodes battle infidels rather engaged warfare englishmen fellow christians 
well understand sir thomas said 
could hold aloof tresham 
vows order means hinder us taking part affairs country 
rule order indeed rule constantly broken 
otherwise could commanderies country entering order abandon nationality form part one community east 
order true oaths 
defend holy sepulchre present hopelessly lost wage war infidel 
funds necessary well swords commanderies throughout europe supply funds struggle maintained needed send contingents help fighting east 
neglect cardinal point templars fell 
commanderies amassed wealth wide possessions unlike us knights abstained altogether fulfilling vows ceased resist infidel 
therefore suppressed general approval europe portion possessions handed knights st john 
however understand wish soon boy comes age wield arms shall go rhodes become active member order 
indeed rule neophytes served certain time permitted return join one commanderies native countries 
wish gervaise father said least wish remain rhodes civil troubles absolutely end 
life ruined 
loving retirement quiet longing nothing much life among tenantry almost boy actively engaged warfare away exile 
every one gentle blood less mixed civil broils 
us personally matter whether member house york lancaster sits throne yet almost compelled take sides one middle age eve another battle risk life fortune 
win gain naught satisfaction seeing young edward made king england 
lose going exile may leave wife widow child penniless 
true tresham likely fall child might left without protector well fatherless 
however provide 
write letter peter aubusson real governor rhodes grand master orsini old rule little nominal 
death aubusson certain elected grand master 
dear friend mine 
entered order year comrades many fight moslems quite sure tell last request memory long friendship appoint son one grand master pages 
know one however high rank accepted novice age sixteen 
year probation received body order professed knight must go serve time rhodes 
three years active service must reside two convent made commander 
one exception rule namely pages grand master entitled privilege admission age twelve become professed knights thirteen 
son nine say must remember aubusson yet grand master orsini may live years yet 
aubusson however doubtless get appoint boy one pages 
case three years yet passed go 
doubtless spend mother care well provide everything furnish dame letter knight probably succeed grand prior english langue asking see care education boy time proceed rhodes 
may hope dear tresham occasion use documents may able personally watch career 
still well take every precaution 
shall course give aubusson full particulars vow wishes 
thank greatly old friend sir thomas said 
taken load mind 
shall leave mother march forward bid ill befalls cross france keep gervaise bring part 
jewels considerable sum money accepted man enjoying estates last five years lieu monies received time 
therefore lack means years come 
besides queen margaret real affection doubtless glad exile 
old enough gervaise said suddenly looking missal grand prior examining chop head duke york bring mother back england 
valiant champion doubt boy prior said laughing 
father want 
chop heads many infidels leave englishmen alone dukes commoners 
far glorious career aiding defend europe moslem engaged wars countrymen 
great lords fight let fight without aid hope long become man even tired perpetual broils agreement may arrived peace reign unhappy land 
besides gervaise father added must bear mind always earnest wish hope become champion cross 
took solemn vow born son granted would dedicate service cross taken must still try carry oath effect 
trust rate years attain manhood expend whole strength powers defense christianity worthy knight order st john 
many knights serving three years infidels return native countries pass rest lives slothful ease commanderies save perhaps great crisis go join struggle 
life wish lead 
death mother family ties england nothing recall 
house york succeeds establishing firmly throne estates forfeited 
therefore regard rhodes permanent home devote life order 
beginning young may hope distinguish gain high rank remember though wishes orders career must hands 
brave knight father boy said firmly 
right boy 
go upstairs bed already late 
regret vow went gervaise left room though regret son 
singular men care comes suppose human nature 
liked think descendants would sit old house men race name would long estates 
doubtless best least view permanent loss estates case yorkists triumph without poignant regret 
doubtless best tresham must remember things may even turn think 
knight done brave service find much difficulty obtaining pope dispensation vows 
numbers knights left order married perpetuated name 
almost necessity otherwise many princes barons would object sons entering order 
object keep back irruption moslems men done share hard work regret need felt desire leave order 
founder thought covering europe monasteries beyond fact necessary men administer manors estates see reason freely leave reach age thirty thirty five indeed believe would strengthen rather weaken us vows taken age seventeen fifteen years 
something knight said thoughtfully 
however far distance concerns little still agree see advantage men time usefulness order past bound settle monastic life nature habit unsuited 
spirits long years warfare well content assuredly others life forced inactivity youth manhood spent action must well nigh unendurable 
tell frankly think chances 
everything depends upon time 
promises aid come quarters edward delays shall soon head overwhelming force 
edward faults vices able energetic leader must well aware strike successfully must strike soon 
must hope able 
tell whether intend march direct london join pembroke wales march north divines purpose hardly dare move lest rapid movement interpose london 
gives us month success certain 
give battle fortnight one say matter end 
edward indeed losing time 
stayed days london victory barnet th april left windsor ordering forces join 
lancastrians endeavored puzzle intended movements sending parties various directions soon gathered force numerically small composed veteran soldiers hurried west determined bring battle earliest opportunity 
queen advisers determined move first wells point could either go north march upon london 
edward entered abingdon th finding lancastrians still wells marched northwest means hoped intercept moved north would able fall back bar road london advanced direction 
therefore moved cirencester waited news learned visited bristol obtained reinforcements men supplies money cannon started high road gloucester 
sent messengers son lord beauchamp held castle gloucester assuring following full speed would come aid forthwith 
messengers arrived time queen long march arrived gloucester found gates shut face 
governor taken steps prevent numerous adherents town rising behalf manning walls refused surrender 
knowing edward coming rapidly evident time spare attempt take town queen army therefore pressed without waiting tewkesbury 
across river would speedily joined earl pembroke edward would forced fall back 
time reached river however thoroughly exhausted 
marched thirty six miles without rest along bad roads woods unable go farther 
queen urged river crossed leaders force opinion better halt 
edward would able follow across river attack disorder still wearied operation making passage would certainly crush 
moreover retreat would discourage soldiers battle must fought better fight especially could choose strong position 
queen gave way army encamped large field front town 
position well calculated defense country around broken intercepted lanes deep hedges ditches extremely difficult approach 
evening edward came men also marched six thirty miles encamped night within three miles lancastrian position 
queen troops felt confident victory 
point numbers superior antagonists advantage strong position 
sir thomas tresham proposed left wife son exeter force marched away 
despondent love said weeping wife bade goodbye 
everything favor good hope happy termination long struggle 
win lose assured last time draw sword 
proved fidelity house lancaster risked life fortune cause feel done share whichever way providence may decide issue struggle accept 
lose come scatheless fight ride hither embark plymouth france live quietly time comes edward may feel seated sufficient firmness throne forgive past offences grant amnesty fought

next day however talking ralph harcourt remarked hear harcourt aubusson praised young tresham highly 
seems nothing way unfair selected higher praise 
unfair ralph said warmly generous nature incapable base feeling envy 
tresham great deal 
saw pirate boat gaining fast upon us seemed sir john boswell well scarce chance escape could choose spot make stand sell lives dearly could 
could see sir john scanning hill spot could best defend 
hiding small island hundred men eager blood searching us well nigh impossible

sir john old tried soldier said quickness merit conception oldest knight order could done better one praise unduly 
four years older gervaise tresham tell named tomorrow commander galley would willingly serve 
well well need angry harcourt nothing say tresham

best ralph said shortly small credit fighting lives 
cowardly beast fight circumstances 
see moslem rushing scimitar hand know cut cut naturally strike hard quickly 
never liked gervaise rivers 
sure know always speak contemptuous sort tone 
true harm certainly good 
reason feel contempt although much younger better swordsman better rider 
liked every one auberge said always good tempered quiet unassuming 
earth always set know set rivers said sullenly 
great liking natural enough seeing father lancastrian yorkists pleasant see much made boy merely aubusson favored 
certain harcourt said hotly idea never occurred one 
sir peter great man soon grand master present grand prior langue auvergne whether favors tresham matter concerns none us 
gervaise liked us good qualities 
bears young knight respectfully towards seniors ever ready service one 
one ever seen temper always kind considerate servants command parties slaves public works never says harsh word treats human beings brute beasts 
besides though skilful us sword indeed military exercises unassuming particle pride arrogance 
things liked friendship aubusson naught whatever 
aubusson prophesied rise distinguished rank order 
boswell ricord said one thoroughly believe 
one among us age twenty might go farther already credit one sixteen make mark order like certain rise high office may many years proud serve 
never rivers said fiercely 
would rather go bury life smallest commandery england 
may harcourt retorted temper also roused possibly might prefer fighting leader 
reflection courage sir ralph harcourt shall lay matter bailiff 
like harcourt said disdainfully think benefit pains 
temper cooled rivers acknowledged truth harcourt said 
favor bailiff harcourt tresham stood present moment high estimation 
complaint would lead inquiry matter led former words even harcourt reprimanded using would assuredly gain estimation knights 
harcourt thought matter though laughingly told gervaise rivers means gratified attaining honor secular knighthood virtually placed head 
nice fellow gervaise said 
naturally must galling good many others yet chance distinguishing 
think good kind cordial 
course otherwise old professed knights serving quite different rivers somehow never friendly course doubly galling 
hope soon get opportunity winning spurs 
like tresham 
place good wishes fellow never lost opportunity annoying without smallest cause offence part 
sure would wish ill harcourt 
would make allowance feel opportunities would obtained credit honors

still though surprised delighted see 
tell us voyage 
gervaise gave brief account adventure pirate described visit governor ship 
say anything courteous solemn sort man would fancy turkish governor 
looked little surprised accosted turkish asked questions time though daresay inquired afterwards suleiman came speak language

next jerusalem like see acre ralph harcourt exclaimed 
cities closely connected order

indeed grand stately fortress 
done possible make rhodes impregnable nature nothing us nature done everything castle looks could defy assaults army however large 
indeed wrested us force 
knights city walls stormed town filled foes fought way water edge embarked reduced mere handful however strong castle may needs hands defend 
still well nigh moved tears see turkish banner waving think many tens thousands christian soldiers died effort retain holy places died vain 
wonder whether turks ever forced relinquish hold holy places tell sir giles bailiff come group unobserved said quietly 
certainly time moslem power threatens us europe crumbled dust 
long acre remains power hope

listened respectfully words leader although opinion fell like cold water upon fiery zeal high hopes hearers 
possibility losing rhodes never entered minds majority 
likely ere long might called upon stand siege acquainted strength place deep seemingly impassable moat massive walls protecting towers bastions seemed rhodes capable withstanding assaults however numerous foe however oft repeated invasion 
bailiff knew man dauntless courage wide experience great judgment believe rhodes would although time inevitably fall brought home first time fact fortress outpost europe one placed distant christendom hour peril might unable furnish aid 
bailiff walked away silence short time sir giles trevor said cheerfully well lasts time need trouble heads take place afterwards 
bailiff says duty present mean drive turks back come see occasion us take heart even fated moslems shall one day walk tombs 
christendom chooses supine let christendom suffer say rate going weep may take place turned dust 
sounds well sir giles ralph harcourt said argument advance though sure much said bailiff chaplain indeed elders heard say doubt would fitting reply 
sir giles tossed head mockingly 
shall fight neither better worse friend harcourt may someday moslems bailiff seems think destined lord 
promised vowed best moslems vow holds good long flesh beyond concern 
staying wasting time hour us going starting ball given signor succhi one richest merchants town gay one lack fair faces rhodes 
grievous pity elders set even younger members community joining dance 
one things swore give 
however rhodes flying face rules 
three four young knights also going 
thinking gervaise harcourt asked 
nothing particular ralph except first must write letter suleiman ali hand bailiff praying send first vessel may put way acre 
may neglected promised write directly got 
half hour shall ready anything like 
less time indeed rejoined ralph 
shall say stroll streets never tired 
like better go way roofs gervaise 
streets badly lit although busy enough quarters narrow one gets jostled pushed 
terraces everything quiet 
plenty light music pleasant see families sitting together enjoying one disposed cup wine cool sherbet delighted give pleased one us joins group 
quite number acquaintances made way working away turkish 
well gervaise said 
fancy ralph let us take one paths across roofs 
might walk twenty years without making acquaintance pledge join intimacies 
however shall quite content amuse looking scene general paying visits drinking sherbet 
plenty fair girls among rhodians ralph said smile though pledged celibacy way bound abstain admiration 
gervaise laughed 
admire much like ralph expect 
scarcely much spoken woman since entered house london idea say young girl 
part education true knight courteous women 
one great duties chivalry 
must remember secular knights well knights order 
work order quite sufficient present ralph 
time may come like society women admire beauty possibly even wear color one seems fashion though bound celibacy admire one woman another understand 
time descended castle taking way along one broad paths led flat roofs houses means bridges thrown across streets 
acquaintances mine ralph said stopping one walls three feet high bordered path 
beyond enclosure fifty feet square 
clumps shrubs flowers surrounded stonework eight ten inches high enclosing earth grew scattered 
lamps hung cords stretched others arranged among flowers 
center large carpet spread eight ten persons seated cushions 
girl playing lute another singing accompaniment 
stopped abruptly eye fell upon figures two young knights 
sir ralph harcourt father exclaimed italian language used island spoken less fluency knights among served general medium communication 
waiting invited sir knight went saucily 
thought time would know welcome 
tongue runs fast child father said rose walked across ralph 
welcome sir ralph welcome 
pray enter join us 
pleasure signor vrados also extend hospitality friend sir gervaise tresham 
gladly merchant said 
pray enter 
two knights passed gate wall 
rose feet went carpet greeted ralph warmth showed favorite 
introduced gervaise 
wonder know face sir knight merchant wife said 
thought knew knights order sight seeing either public ceremonies observing pass streets 
last nine months sir gervaise anchorite 
learning turkish devoted study even scarce caught sight save meals 
walking streets last thing would think 
consider good conscientious young knight nothing respect friend 
used look upon little brother house order london together 
four years younger know four years boys makes immense difference 
tables turned quite look 
believe much like signora sir ralph says gervaise laughed 
says known time must time learned word taken literally 
learned quite early acquaintance girl first noticed said affectation gravity 
always tell believe anything says grateful sir knight thus borne evidence quickness perception 
time servants brought cushions ralph gervaise seated 
wine sherbet cakes handed round 
master house placed gervaise right hand stranger 
among islands sir gervaise indeed need ask since know sir ralph knighted together valor affair ships hassan ali 
come lesbos 
eighty years since family settled rhodes seen grow small place great fortress 
tis wonderful place gervaise said 
know nothing fortresses europe seems well stronger among places natural advantages 
knights always abundance slaves merchant said many sufficient work able sell numbers european potentates 
yes rhodes wonderfully strong 
great fosse would seem could defy efforts army cross yet past shown even strongest defences held greatest bravery carried generals immense armies careless sacrifice succeed 
look acre example 
looking five days ago gervaise said thinking beyond might man take 
mean acre merchant asked surprise 
yes 
went hand captive ransomed 
course safe conduct glad indeed opportunity seeing famous fortress 
fortunate indeed sir knight pardon saying singular young knight chosen 
assuredly even senior knights order would rejoice opportunity beholding fortress intimately connected past history order 
due entirely able speak turkish gervaise said 
friend sir ralph mentioning studying hard speak language fluently necessity mission knights speak high office could hardly asked undertake unimportant service selected 
really speak turkish well accomplishment save greeks subject turkey possess 
intend may ask make rhodes home ask suppose would taken labor intended shortly return england 
yes hope remain permanently 
know first step towards promotion generally commandery home enter order idea gaining office dignity 
desire simply knight cross spend life faithful service order 
worthy ambition indeed one far experience goes knights entertain 
see yearly scores young knights depart small proportion never place foot rhodes although doubtless many hasten back soon danger assault turks becomes imminent 
see dwell protection order naturally talk things among although matter fortifications admit enormous efforts made render town secure clear matter knights defend much left desired 
well say knights parts europe would flock hither defend journey would long one would occupy much time would probably receive news turks sailed place already invested 
would difficult altogether impossible ships reinforcements make way turkish fleet enter port 
man walls properly would need force five times numerous 
recognize valor knights accomplished wonders 
even accomplish impossibilities 
time could hold walls number became reduced fire turkish cannon battles breaches would last weak longer repel onslaughts foes almost unlimited supply soldiers 
true enough gervaise admitted mind shocking four fifths least order pledged oppose infidels occupied inglorious work looking manors estates society throughout europe one fifth performing duties sworn 
revenues estates mere fraction finds way hither 
still trust greater part knights hasten soon danger becomes imminent without waiting news turkish armament actually set forth 
hour two young knights remained roof gervaise talking quietly merchant companion laughed chatted ladies friends host 
left promise would long repeated visit ralph bantered gervaise preferring society merchant daughters 
found pleasant well informed man ralph enjoyed talk enjoyed talking nonsense daughters listening songs 
man sitting next eldest daughter belong rhodes greek one islands though catch 
know whether relative family business connection merchant stranger brought letter introduction 
nothing said head ask like man face handsome fellow crafty expression 
say much seemed times appeared sitting carelessly sipping sherbet really trying listen vrados saying 
could side circle speaking somewhat low tones rest chatting laughing 
want listen sapient knight tell ralph certain trying listen 
well doubt talking sensibly us ralph laughed certainly showed discernment 
daresay wrong gervaise said quietly know spies constantinople probably sultan spies idea occurred perhaps man might one 
well bound say gervaise ralph said little irritably never heard grave accusation brought insufficient evidence rather far see without shadow evidence kind 
drop upon man one respected merchants whose family established many years whose interests must order guest care take active part joking girls imagine cunning expression face must straightway take head must spy 
excuse ralph simply said idea occurred might spy different thing accusing one 
ready admit chances infinitely greater honest trader relation merchant presence perfectly legitimate natural spy 
still chance one thousand may latter 
think suspicious nature really like learn little man 
mean going try 
would unworthy action pry another business concern one 
still like know 
ralph shrugged shoulders 
comes living life hermit gervaise 
people meet talk enjoy society city without troubling heads moment people come business still less whether spies 
ideas much occur must say think sooner fall ways people better 
harm done gervaise said composedly 
thinking asking bailiff order arrested suspicion 
remarked like man face way pretended thinking nothing trying overhear saying 
quite willing admit made mistake devoting turkish going merchant evening 
experience whatever call society far giving pleasure talk strangers especially women seems talk annoying rate present 
get age possibly ideas may change 
moment wish judge others apparently enjoy distraction serious work 
say simply amusement understand 
must remember entered order consequence solemn vow dead father regard profession make serious one present intention devote life entirely order active fulfilment vows 
right gervaise ralph said good temperedly 
think would pity turn fanatic 
jerusalem palestine lost admit really little chance ever regaining 
duties therefore changed army knights pledged war infidels way knights nobles home ever ready engage war france 
vow poverty long since obsolete 
many chief officials men great wealth indeed grand master bailiff langue expected spend spend sum vastly exceeding allowance order 
great body knights equally lax vows carry length know caused grave scandal 
see way incumbent us give pleasures life 
military order ready fight defense rhodes bygone days ready fight defense holy sepulchre 
kings great nobles endowed us large number estates order maintain us army islam duty 
affect asceticism date ridiculous 
certainly wish ascetic ralph 
objection hold estates hold 
think present great danger hanging us would better first place spend less time idleness amusement devote energies cause 
mean fighting time comes fighting endeavoring every way ward danger 
see danger best ward gervaise go nose air snuffing danger like hunting dog pursuit game 
rate bother accompany visits future 
chapter ix galley slaves gervaise consideration obliged ralph right saying ground whatever suspicion greek met signor vrados could see means following matter 
would felt honorable go merchant house avail hospitality watching guest 
determined dismiss matter mind indeed altogether done week later suddenly recurred memory 
party slaves escort overseers charge knight work fortifications passing along street way back barracks 
already dusk gervaise going way stood aside doorway let pass 
point stepping follow saw man standing shadow wall fall ranks walked engaged earnest conversation one slaves 
kept beside hundred yards passed something slave hand turned abruptly side opening 
people growing darkness action man passed unobserved overseers 
gervaise thinking occurrence strange one turned lane man 
slackened pace latter fifty yards ahead would looked round able perceive knight behind 
passing several streets man turned refreshment house 
door stood open place brightly lit gervaise pausing outside able see going inside 
man followed point seating one tables gervaise recognized greek met merchant house 
walked short distance paused think 
vague suspicions entertained man recurred double force certainly communication one slaves communication secretly effected could good purpose 
far however nothing could tax man 
would probably deny altogether spoken slaves gervaise could point one conversed 
rate nothing could done required time think steps could take follow matter 
resolved however wait follow greek came 
minutes repassed door saw man engaged earnest conversation another 
considering time gervaise thought would best follow man left ascertain rather keep watch movements greek likely would return merchant walked several times street last saw two men issue together 
stopped moment outside exchanging words separated greek going direction quarter lay house vrados walked towards gervaise 
latter passed carelessly man gone nearly end street turned followed 
could see lay brother order 
class consisted men inferior social position knights filled many minor offices eligible promotion 
following ten minutes gervaise saw approach one barracks prisons occupied slaves 
knocked door upon opened entered 
matter assumed much serious aspect 
young greek stranger rhodes communication slaves prison official matter appeared grave gervaise deliberation thought important endeavor follow alone necessary lay bailiff 
accordingly evening meal went sir john kendall asked could confer alone matter somewhat troubled 
bailiff assented gervaise followed private apartment 
matter sir gervaise asked pleasantly 
nothing serious trust know sir john 
matter consideration seems importance ought brought knowledge 
face bailiff grew grave seating chair motioned gervaise 
let hear said 
gervaise told story simply 
slight smile passed across bailiff face mentioned met greek roof house signor vrados liked expression face 
vrados fair daughters asked 
yes sir know little 
visit ever paid indeed house one town 
sir john face grew grave gervaise recounted seen man enter communication slave frowned heavily heard meeting afterwards one prison officers 
truth sir gervaise said pause seems right serious matter done wisely informing seen 
assuredly mischief sort wind 
question get bottom 
course grand master might order arrest greek prison officer may sure neither would commit unless torture applied one belief man says circumstances 
honest man may traitor racked torture may denounce innocent men 
best clumsy device 
think matter hardly thought yet sir john certainly plan yet occurred 
well think sir gervaise 
likely days make difference 
take measures see greek sail away island present speak port master 
give matter consideration shown quick witted following matter far rely upon carry farther 
may possibly simple explanation matter 
may come island turks masters perhaps brought message relatives slave talk prison officer may wholly innocent 
find keep matter possible shall get finely laughed comrades run upon false scent 
hand matter turn serious assuredly get great credit discovered 
therefore turn mind tonight see arrive scheme seeing take steps 
morning gervaise called upon sir john kendall 
well sir gervaise hope hit upon scheme getting bottom matter 
confess though sleepless night able see method getting root affair save application torture 
know whether plan thought commend opinion sir worked scheme think enable us get bottom matter 
believe galley expected back cruise today tomorrow 
sir idea go board small craft command knight upon whose discretion silence rely example sir john boswell intercept galley 
board disguise turkish slave sir john hand officer command galley giving letter private instructions disposal 
slaves board would ask kept apart well rowers galley 
landed sent prison saw officer enter last night slaves rowers distributed among prisons 
thus slaves placed would know arrived galley slaves captured 
doubt able maintain assumed character short time taken confidence others learn going

mean say sir gervaise knight order willing submit indignity treated slave keep disguise long enough taken confidence plotters might stay time prison officials believe ordinary slave put work either walls one galleys 
ready anything benefit order safety rhodes meet approval gervaise replied 
doubt unpleasant enter order pleasant things perform certain duties duties necessarily involve certain amount sacrifice 
think would able maintain character must remember detected might torn pieces slaves officers could interfere protect 
feel sure sir john 
story would tell would say come syria sailed acre trader perfectly true also taken ship galley would altogether false crossed one landed 
think would little questioning pretend state sullen despair give short answers questions soon left alone 
scheme good one sir gervaise though full danger difficulty 
ready render great service order willingly accept sacrifice offer make 
send one slaves town buy garments suitable also stains skin 
course necessary shave portion head turkish fashion 
also see sir john boswell ask arrange craft ready start noon 
galley expected evening course may arrive moment

knight go disguise infidel slave seems beyond bounds 
one ready give one life order sir john surely one need mind weeks inconvenience

well know sir john replied doubtfully 
necessity choice moreover accident exposed 
surely better thing one free one forced sir john knight silent 
stout fighting man unused argument 
well said long pause hope turn right promise strangled prison see every slave hand shall strung 
told kendall frankly place would permit try venture 
however could think plan would chance getting bottom matter words effect 
much cared officers gaol knew see treachery work would defeat object altogether 
suppose rascal greek intending say sir john 
may trying get exact plan fortifications may arranging plan communication case siege news condition state defences may conveyed turkish commander 
time reached port embarked trading vessel belonging one merchants sir john readily obtained use day two 
sails hoisted rowed port 
proceeded three four miles lowered sails lay course galley making port would take

gervaise retired cabin set aside use proceeded disguise 
hour later sir john came

entering crossed courtyard door standing open 
within vaulted room forty feet long twenty wide along side rushes strewn thickly 
others started work said today sleep

however helped 
presently strolled courtyard slaves disabled illness injuries seated sun

indeed one others exclaimed 
oh see dogs brought suffering suffered toiling oars one galleys fortifications one castles make amends suffering 
hard fight 
small craft vain attempt resistance 
would gladly fought sailors said would throw away lives 
little board allowed vessel go free sailors old made useful hard work 
questions asked 
men seemed interest save misery gervaise soon left sitting shady corner presently dropped sleep 
evening came various work 
officer man brought gervaise went overseer galley slaves informed told new slave pointing gervaise gang 
brought galley arrived last night said slave sent 
hear set aside appointed servitor vacancies sent till one occur ordered make useful ways meantime 
two three hands short overseer said

however fellow make even number strong active though present looks sulky enough bad fortune 
slaves spoke gervaise waiting food brought majority dropped upon rushes exhausted toil heat feel interest anything 
food consisted rye bread thin broth brought great iron vessel 
slave horn used soup water done rule enforced among take fountain courtyard wash added pile corner room 
cool evening aided meal restoring energies slaves 
several gathered round gervaise asked questions knew prospects early invasion rhodes soon officer left room closing locking door slaves became part silent 
men sat groups together talking undertones greater number threw rushes either sleep think alone 
gervaise struck manner lay without making slightest movement long light enable make figures

generally go hour two exercise well enough keeps us strong health 
away voyages work hard 
sometimes row morning night chase another craft really exert greatly 
terrible

chapter xii boy galley among pleased appointment gervaise command galley sir john boswell 
ever since adventure pirates knight exhibited almost fatherly interest encouraged studies ridden occasions permitted short holiday whenever together related stories war sieges battles escapes thought young knight might gain lessons future guidance 
doubt gervaise said one day riding quietly along road whether plan life altogether best 
founded know simply body monks bound devote solely care sick give hospitality pilgrims palestine 
monkish work men devoted solely life charity hospital jerusalem might well renounce human pleasures great change made master raymond du puy nursing body became brotherhood arms seems vows celibacy longer needful desirable 
crusaders many married men fought worse 
would far better methinks converted order pledged resist infidel without vows poverty celibacy never seriously regarded 
garrison might composed indeed principally young knights cared marry officers order whose wives families might dwell 
would many advantages 
among others presence many ladies rank would excellent effect discountenancing repressing extravagances dissolute habits common shame order 
knights possessing commanderies throughout europe would worse stewards married men scandals contributed largely downfall templars would avoided 
sole vow necessary far see would knights remain unmarried disposable times service ten years making profession afterwards ever ready obey summons arms occasions safety rhodes invasion christian country moslems rendered services needful would come knights richard lion heart went crusaders 
spent half life since joined order commanderies home dull life glad enough resign last command come 
able marry might son age whose career could watch feel pride 
life would far happier england respects better man 
methinks would strengthen rather weaken order 
fighting body way inferior liked respected throughout europe naturally sight many men leading luxurious life commanderies causes feeling 
suppose sir john great difficulty obtaining dispensation vows matters everything depends upon interest money 
course dispensations common doubtless knight served term active service could especially request backed grand master obtain pope dispensation vows 
commandery would make vacancy give grand prior grand master council whosoever gift might opportunity rewarding services gratifying powerful family 
agree would much better sir john 
understand monks ever living quiet life apart world content continue among body warlike knights must many time must come regret vows took boys 
cadet noble family might death elder brothers come head great family ruler wide domains 
surely would desirable man able marry heirs 
doubtless could managed cases gervaise pity managed 
see reason world knight ten years service free marry providing takes vow render full service order whenever called upon 
already vow poverty everywhere broken 
already defiance oaths many knights lead idle dissolute lives 
already knights countries disregard rule shall draw sword cause save holy sepulchre like knights nobles take part civil strife foreign wars 
scandal better far away oaths save obedience willingness war infidel make vows men know constantly shamelessly broken 
fond gervaise 
proud one brought honor langue time bring honor 
glad far young knight one middle age friendship us 
see greater pleasure would give life son could lay funds could well spare instead spending appointments neither kith kin give sigh regret news comes fallen engagement infidels 
often think things sometimes talk comrades hold would far better become purely military order like military orders courts european sovereigns remain half monk half soldier mixture far see accords badly either morality public repute 
however see chance change coming must content observe vows well may long willing remain monks try obtain dispensation vows desire alter mode life 
ought either remained monks pure simple spending lives deeds charity life suits many men last say anything else soldiers pure simple crusaders wrested holy sepulchre hands infidels 
present gervaise vocation lies wholly way fighting may time come may aims ambitions vows order gall 
hope sir john gervaise said earnestly 
young yet knight replied indulgent smile 
day may think differently 
went changing subject abruptly galley ready last ride sir john 
shipwrights finished tomorrow next day shall take possession begin practice man shall know duties galley slaves learn row well orders sail

contrary sir pedro hope improving

used quite giddy sick heat getting oars scarce strength work 
important point 
port slaves always sleep prison sea must rest benches clothes soaked heavy dew must severe trial prejudicial health 
awning cost ducats reckon putting aside comfort slaves speedily repaid better health capacity labor 
away galley sir louis ricord used feel greatest pity unfortunate wretches daybreak drenched clothes shivering cold wet rose commence work 
took vow ever come command galley would provide awning slaves 
two three knights standing expressed warm approval gervaise said 
days little sentiment humanity prevalent slaves everywhere regarded mere beasts burden rather human beings 
however question put gervaise done ready give hearty agreement although utilitarian rather humanitarian side question recommended 
three hours rest journey renewed nightfall galley anchored islet lying north carpathos 
servants laying tables along poop evening meal gervaise went see orders carried regarding food slaves

chapter xiii first prizes leaving slaves gervaise joined companions poop 
engaged animated discussion whether advisable grant indulgences slaves 
majority approved steps gervaise taken asserted concessions would lead look would create discontent among crews galleys favored 
well comrades said gervaise think far better qualified give opinion may fall lot slave turkish hands 
case affirm certainty keenly appreciate alleviation however small lot 
must remember one feeling slave dull despair 
death relief look forward 
think man feeling best either oar kind work sure would case 
brighten life little show regarded merely brute beast take interest work different spirit 
even viewed merely monetary point view must pay well render content possible lot 
know great mortality among slaves pine away die material malady detected simply hopelessness weariness life aided undoubtedly case galley slaves sleeping damp night air exposure day full heat sun 
brings answer second objection 
undoubtedly might cause discontent among slaves galleys hear others treated better 
hope return bring back slaves good condition health contrast appearance slaves galleys marked admiral may consider would well order awnings fixed vessels order even grant slaves away voyages little indulgences given 
expense would trifling would certainly add great deal average life slave would render capable better work 
another advantage 
turks learn countrymen hands treated certain amount kindness consideration might lead act similarly order may unfortunate enough fall hands

wind south sails oars prizes able keep fairly abreast galley 
short intervals rest slaves continued work night shortly daybreak land seen ahead pilot pronounced cape carbonara 
good landfall gervaise ralph said 
pilot done right well 
suppose mean anchor get certainly ralph 
slaves rowed nearly eighteen hours two hours rest 
must hours least sleep go 
night turn also 
send boat ashore try find natives may come across whether vessels bearing appearance moorish corsairs seen passing coast also find bays inlets would likely anchor 
italian knights best go boat though believe people speak different dialect mainland would chance understanding others 
sun risen little fleet came anchor close cape 
boat prepared go ashore gervaise begged fabricius caretto senior rescued italian knights endeavor find whether swift sailing craft kind could hired 
secure terms come galley 
gervaise already talked matter ralph agreed strongly manned craft kind would go faster taken moreover would pity weaken force sending one prizes away 
seen gervaise retired cabin threw short sleep leaving knights watch night see went well 
two hours roused 
native craft come alongside sir fabricius caretto 
think craft us knight said gervaise came deck 
belongs large fishing village round point left 
several boats villagers said speediest vessel anywhere along coast 
belongs two brothers four men constitute regular crew arranged twelve others go order may row along good pace wind falls light 
companions come yet hoist flag recall 

shall greatly obliged undertake mission seaports 
needs one name rank speak nobles officials authoritatively 
gladly sir gervaise 
give instructions rely upon carrying 
thank greatly sir fabricius shall glad take two knights may select 
write letters deliver authorities naples pisa genoa 
shall write briefly leave explain matters fully 
shall merely say intelligence arrival fleet moorish corsairs whose strength ignorant assuredly intention make raid commerce coast perhaps land unprotected places 
ostia warning authorities send orders along coast inhabitants guard pray carry word rome request holiness pope order armed galleys put sea soon possible 
beg naples pisa thing 
course genoa must hope assistance 
place possible see syndic council got quickly together 
moment done genoa sail island madalena lies northeastern point island 
either find us boat message direct course 
think perhaps best omit naples save fully day two 
pray ostia send news coast request papal authorities despatch mounted messengers 
tis likely first rate corsairs try narrower waters north 
ostia nigh two hundred miles wind brisk may arrive tomorrow afternoon start night arriving pisa noon following day allowing four five hours ascend river may genoa next morning 
three hours suffice gather authorities force despatch soon learned embark sail south 
may reach madalena two days 
thus earliest must six seven days bring us news meet calms foul winds may well nigh double time 
ostia get faster craft hire take relay fresh rowers 
furnish means give letters 
less half hour gervaise deck 
boat returned italian knights 
ample store provisions placed board sperondra crew three knights without minute delay took places board great sails hoisted craft glided rapidly away 
villagers spoke truly speed ralph said looked 
even light wind running fully six miles hour look sky soon make run ostia well within time calculated 
gervaise questioned italian knights information gained 
said peasants told several strange craft using oars sails noticed passing northwards strong opinion either algerines tunisians last three four days none fishing craft ventured put sea 
able tell little bays along coastline described rugged precipitous 
five six little streams ran knew mountains 
thought likely places corsairs rendezvous would deep indentation north cape bellavista behind cape comino 
places might meet great bay whose entrance stands tavolara island beyond several deep inlets northeastern coast island 
gervaise consultation ralph 
first thing find corsairs meeting place ralph must done without catching sight galley prizes would sure recognize 
ralph nodded 
difficult question gervaise 
course boat speedy enough row away corsairs would easy enough wind oars go fast boat could escape 
quite certain ralph therefore done boat must one small insignificant would pay little attention caught sight 
idea take little boat fast one paint black give appearance fisherman boat hire couple good rowers village 
one knight dressed fisherman go ahead us explore every inlet ships could sheltered 
would follow ten miles behind 
get near places natives think fleet likely boat must go night anchor 
way ought able discover corsairs unseen gain idea numbers position anchored bring us back news 
shall go gervaise could spare ralph 
risk capture seem great certainly risk dare part 
better italian doubtless opportunity landing villages questioning inhabitants therefore send fosco 
eight ten corsairs gathered bays news sure travel along shore may get tidings way 
first thing send village fetch two young fishermen must active fellows strong possessed courage 
ask da vinci go select 
away paint boat black make ready start sooner better 
italian knight undertook mission started shore 
fosco chosen principally light frame well shrewd intelligent called mission explained

gervaise took cabin consulted maps galley furnished 
row muravera twenty miles 
see village lies mouth river 
soon arrive land find whether report moorish pirates seen along coast

next day get lunasei five miles side cape bellavista certainly know pirates lying behind cape 
row back meet us remain come evening

fosco came board 
news beyond gained morning sir gervaise said 
strange ships certainly seen sailing north approach coast 
similar report given lunasei certainly corsairs lying behind cape bellavista news would assuredly reached village 
orosei next day report strange ships cape comino 
warned overnight coast beyond cape precipitous would villages make inquiries arranged fosco ships anchor north cape go inspect next bay 
found ships return daybreak land one villages bay make inquiries 
news brought night 
evident pirates bay gervaise ralph said came deck daybreak 
yes glad 
large bay genoese send half dozen galleys pirates might still escape next bays deeper narrower would easy entrap 
along thought probable would rendezvous 
maps show villages many miles round might lie weeks without much shepherd getting sight cliffs 
moreover nearest point cutting ships coming corsica mainland besides snap proceeding south marseilles part pass sardinia corsica 
eight clock boat seen coming round point 
news fosco gervaise asked approached galley 
none sir gervaise 
heard nothing pirates seen anything 
exclamations disappointment broke knights 
makes likely gervaise said lying one inlets north 
see lower kept comparatively close shore careless might notice approached rendezvous would careful might either pass along night keep far 
anxious conceal near presence would likely put bay search plunder captives tempe one largest sardinian towns lies short distance away must considerable amount traffic 
four five small craft lying fosco time stepped board put considerable number fishing boats 
came upon ships dark thought first lighted pirates letting boat drift closely soon saw corsair galleys 
shall get anchor go bay ralph asked 
safer ralph 
possibly one craft lying might presently captured might learn crew presence galley order 
therefore think best remain till nightfall proceed anchor north side island madalena find sheltered cove could seen either land passing ships 
day good deal discussion among knights whether corsairs might already sailed away 
evident ships arrived would motive delay 
three ships knew would never join others might detained cause another 
could doubt pirates already ample force capturing many merchant vessels might come across 
might intended carry daring project sack burn towns along coast carry leading people ransom fill vessels slaves attack made simultaneously several unprotected towns 
vast amount plunder could thus reaped together captives even greater money value 
plan would doubtless delay promised join expedition arrived 
balance opinion corsairs still hiding 
daybreak next morning moored sheltered little bay north madalena galley lying inside prizes concealed much possible view craft might happen pass mouth bay 
fosco started soon darkness fell evening returned early morning 
shouted neared galley hidden deep inlet runs one narrow bays

however mounted messengers sent coast give warning inhabitants towns put posture defense villagers fly wives families interior soon saw galleys doubtful appearance approaching 
four hours started genoa

knights turned gloomy mood caretto returned news hope assistance genoa fortnight seemed therefore pains thrown away

sards shared work rations wine distributed knights sat meal board galley able report everything perfect readiness work sewing mantles making good progress 
day passed slowly young knights burning excitement thought coming fray 
released christians less exultant prospect taking vengeance sufferings long endured scene board four ships animated 
talking ralph gervaise told three knights prizes ten board 
reduced strength board galley seventeen would assistance strong band sards considered ample circumstances 
arranged galley one prizes close first corsair came two prizes attack second 
capturing assist circumstances might dictate 
gervaise strongly impressed upon knights command prize single handed attack corsair unless one consorts near free give assistance 
must run risk reverse said 
certain destroying many vessels breaking fleet far better escape run risk losing ten number say nothing rescued captivity 
excitement fight order must strictly borne mind 
victory must marred misfortune brought headstrong rashness 
corsairs bound strongly manned ten knights even aided assistance may get christians might find altogether matched crowd desperate men 
soon dusk anchors drawn fleet got way 
proceeded slowly wind light fishing boats moved heavily water 
however occasion speed gervaise wish commence attack past midnight 
guns loaded starting pile ammunition placed near 
presently wind nearly died galley prizes took coasters fishing craft tow 
nearly one clock got within half mile inlet 
tow ropes thrown fishermen got sweeps galley led way fire ships followed body three prizes brought rear 
oars muffled slowly made way fosco standing next gervaise board galley said point ahead marked entrance inlet 
stopped rowing fire ships close 
previously arranged two lines 
five fishing boats manned four men small boat tow behind formed first line three coasters six men oars three fishing boats formed second 
torches lighted 
ralph took place center boat first line gervaise went board one coasters order given men row 
wind favourable blowing northwest therefore right inlet 
scarcely first boats reached entrance shout heard

soon boats alongside galley guns four vessels opened fire grape crowded ships lit flames clearly noontide battle cry order sounded high din 
nothing save ships near end line ralph said behind may make way others rocks 
see lowering yards sails prevent catching fire pass 
knights distributed among guns worked incessantly directing fire chiefly outside ships hinder crews endeavors arrest progress flames soon able fire impartially mass 
heat flames drove pirates back scores men leapt overboard made shore 
presently two three ships seen making way along narrow line water either side flaming group front 
first advanced galley one prizes rowed short distance forward meet 
deck crowded men among discharge cannon ships created terrible slaughter

fight lasted minute 
appalled disaster befallen terrible effect broadsides poured yards distance sight many dreaded warriors cross corsairs threw arms flung deck hold crying quarter resisted fell either swords knights vengeful axes late captives pikes sards great bulk leaping bow stern swam ashore 
back ships gervaise shouted moment resistance ceased 
leave floating help block way 
six vessels alone managed make escape blazing mass ships captured almost easily first

save wounded decks entirely deserted crews run soon found captors left vessels dropped water made way either swimming assistance oars shore 
remained slaves chained benches 
killed broadsides guns aimed poops forecastles corsairs clustered together consequently number galley slaves fallen comparatively small 
none galleys proportion christians anything like large three prizes first taken greater portion men inland tribes captured warfare malefactors instead executed sold corsairs 
nevertheless six galleys seventy christians found freed 
terrible think galleys destroyed large number christians must perished flames gervaise expressed bitter regret considered attack fire ships must necessarily involve loss many christian lives 
helped ralph said gervaise poured feelings 
many death must welcome attacked sailed italy hundreds thousands christians would killed many carried away captivity see balance favor course adopted 
gervaise admitted nevertheless regret fate many unfortunate captives quite overpowered time satisfaction complete success achieved 
victory almost bloodless one part assailants 
knights received wounds 
two among christian crews killed four sards two score received wounds less serious unlike knights defensive armor 
waiting daylight appear wounds dressed bandaged knights 
morning captured galleys towed anchored short distance away gervaise rowed head inlet followed three ships 
found eleven corsairs burnt satisfaction discovered four uninjured galleys lying deserted save slaves 
seeing fate comrades first issued commanders instead trying escape rowed quietly head inlet movement covered flame smoke landed laden stores support shore 
great satisfaction knights swell list prizes reduced thirty number christian slaves perished flames 
taking galleys tow rowed inlet whose banks strewn half charred timbers oars relics fight 
soon anchored side first prizes council held board santa barbara 
clearly impossible take thirteen prizes rhodes would three four knights fall one moorish pirate might suffer great disaster meet storm would fare badly indeed could depend upon rescued christians management sails oars heavy weather 
time anxious prizes carried rhodes 
never save result great battle fleet captured galleys brought knights prepared endure dangers rather part one 
finally much discussion determined make genoa 
thence rescued captives would able find way homes 
great majority italians spaniards former could proceed land sea respective homes spaniards would long time wait vessel nationality entered port even one lying arrived 
moreover case would necessary despatch vessel genoa order might known danger averted longer necessity getting galleys ready sea 
chief ostensible reason however going genoa would difficulty engaging many sailors might necessary take prizes rhodes 
underlying arguments another reason ralph laughingly stated 
well bring forward one argument another one courage say sure bottom hearts 
know well want go genoa enjoy triumph 
rhodians well many fair faces genoa 
fie sir knights spirit little accordance vows order

sir gervaise reason rate others brought forward suppose agreed sail genoa

young knights langue many friends name sure promise reception hearty sincere shall receive 
settled rescued captives divided equally among thirteen prizes three knights go 
moorish captives also divided equally among aid sails row oars case dead calm setting

shall great trouble one young fishermen spoke little italian said gervaise 
always great number swine herds goats among forests hills

sorry indeed trouble caused gervaise replied afraid give assistance 
shall hunt time sard said confidently 
many villages scattered tempe us fishermen woodmen charcoal burners shall soon get strong body together 
besides know mountains

nightfall gathered next morning set genoa

two days rowing took bastia approach created unbounded excitement banner order seen floating stern santa barbara smaller flags hastily manufactured flew mastheads thirteen prizes 
even inhabitants feared put believing flags ruse numbers fled families valuables mountains 
boat lowered ralph accompanied three four knights rowed ashore panic allayed 
soon understood galley knights captured thirteen corsairs destroyed eleven others thus annihilated fleet intended prey upon commerce italy ravage western coast alarm succeeded wildest enthusiasm

next morning fleet started genoa 
wind much stronger previous day therefore unnecessary oars put except indeed board galley 
nightfall christians relieved slaves hours benches next morning circle hills round genoa city nestling feet water edge climbing distance slopes view

mischance mention might indeed well occur lower sail lie return 
caretto away knights crews breakfasted former put armor gayest attire readiness landing

quite sure among fifty knights one feel well content done duty order gained share credit honor certainly given taken part crushing defeat corsairs 
moment pretend sensible fact second command galley chances obtaining promotion order greatly improved 
nearly two hours caretto returned 
well indeed went said gervaise found city uproar
