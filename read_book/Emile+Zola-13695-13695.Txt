clock struck three 
dismal dingy light came windows 
dark clouds sailing sky made still gloomier 
panes glass covered moisture paris could dimly seen watery vapor blurred far away outskirts seemed hidden thick smoke 
thus city even longer keep child company bright afternoons leaning little seemed though could touch district hand 
little arms tightened despair bosom 
desertion seemed mournful passing bounds characterized injustice wickedness enraged 
never known anything hateful struck everything going vanish nothing old life would ever come back 
caught sight doll seated near chair back cushion legs stretched eyes staring though human 
mechanical doll large one pasteboard head curly hair eyes enamel whose fixed look sometimes frightened 
two years constant dressing undressing paint got rubbed chin cheeks limbs pink leather stuffed sawdust become limp wrinkled like old linen 
doll night attire arrayed bed gown arms twisted one air hanging downwards 
jeanne realized still one felt instant less unhappy 
took doll arms embraced ardently head swung back neck broken 
chattered away telling jeanne best behaved friend good heart never went left jeanne alone 
said treasure kitten dear little pet 
trembling agitation striving prevent weeping covered kisses 
fit tenderness gave revengeful consolation doll fell arm like bundle rags 
rose looked forehead window pane 
rain ceased falling clouds last downpor driven wind nearing horizon towards heights pere lachaise wrapped gloom stormy background paris illumined uniform clearness assumed lonely melancholy grandeur 
seemed uninhabited like one cities seen nightmare reflex world death 
jeanne certainly appeared anything pretty 
idly dreaming loved since birth 
oldest sweetheart one early days marseilles huge cat heavy would clasp little arms carry one chair another without provoking anger least disappeared first misfortune remembered 
next sparrow died picked one morning bottom cage

never reckoned toys got broken grieve kinds wrongs caused much suffering sensitive 
one doll particular higher one hand driven despair getting head smashed cherished degree buried stealth corner yard time afterwards overcome craving look disinterred made sick terror whilst gazing blackened repulsive features 
however always others first fail love 
got broken disappeared 
separation events invariably fault 
never changed 
loved one love lasted life 
mind could grasp idea neglect desertion things seemed monstrously wicked never occurred little heart without giving deadly pang 
shivered host vague ideas slowly awoke within 
people parted one day went way never meet love 
eyes fixed limitless dreary expanse paris sat chilled childish passion could divine life hard blows 
meantime breath fast dimming glass 
hands rubbed away vapor prevented looking 
several monuments distance wet rain glittered like browny ice 
lines houses regular distinct fronts standing pale amidst surrounding roofs looked like outstretched linen tremendous washing spread dry fields ruddy grass 
sky clearing athwart tail cloud still cloaked city gloom milky rays sun beginning stream 
brightness seemed hesitating districts certain places sky would soon begin smile 
jeanne gazed quay slopes trocadero street traffic begin afresh violent downpor 
cabs passed jolting crawl omnibuses rattled along still lonely streets louder noise usual 
umbrellas shut wayfarers taken shelter beneath trees ventured one foot pavement another muddy streams rushing gutters 
jeanne noticed special interest lady little girl fashionably dressed standing beneath awning toy shop near bridge 
doubtless caught shower taken refuge 
child would fain carried away whole shop pestered mother buy hoop 
leaving however child running along full glee driving hoop 
jeanne melancholy returned intensified force doll became hideous 
longed hoop yonder run along mother slowly walked behind cautioned go far 
however everything became dim 
minute rub glass clear 
enjoined never open window full rebellious thoughts surely might gaze window taken walk 
opened leaned like grown person imitation mother ensconced lapsed silence 
air mild moist mildness seemed delightful 
darkness slowly rising horizon induced lift head 
imagination seemed gigantic bird outstretched wings hovering high 
first saw nothing sky clear last angle roof gloomy cloud made appearance sailing speedily enveloping whole heaven 
another squall rising roaring west wind 
daylight quickly dying away city grew dark amidst livid shimmer imparted house fronts rusty tinge 
almost immediately afterwards rain fell 
streets swept umbrellas opened passers fleeing every direction vanished like chaff 
one old lady gripped skirts hands torrent beat bonnet though falling spout 
rain traveled cloud kept pace water ragefully falling upon paris big drops enfiladed avenues quays gallop like runaway horse raising white dust rolled along ground prodigious speed 
also descended champs elysees plunged long narrow streets saint germain district bound filled open spaces deserted squares 
seconds behind veil grew thicker thicker city paled seemed melt away

stiffly erect little teeth displayed never fading smile doll sat one shoulder streaming water every gust wind lifted night dress 
poor body lost sawdust stuffing seemed shivering 
reason prevented mother taking wondered jeanne

left home see friends turn things topsy turvy done afternoon went bois de boulogne led gently hand stopped outside every shop rue de passy 
jeanne could get bottom black eyebrows frowned delicate features put stern jealous expression made resemble wicked old maid 
felt vague way mother gone place children never go 
taken something hidden 
thought filled unutterable sadness heart throbbed pain 
rain becoming finer curtain veiled paris glimpses buildings occasionally afforded 
dome invalides airy quivering first reappear glittering vibration downpor 
next districts emerged sight torrent slackened city seemed rise deluge overwhelmed roofs streaming every street filled river water vapor still ascended 
suddenly burst light ray sunshine fell athwart shower 
moment like smile breaking tears 
rain ceased fall champs elysees district sabring left bank cite far away suburbs sunshine drops could seen flashing like innumerable slender shafts steel 
right rainbow gleamed forth 
gush light streamed across sky touches pink blue appeared horizon medley color suggestive childish attempt water color painting 
sudden blaze fall golden snow city crystal

jeanne sleeves soaked seized fit coughing 
unconscious chill penetrating absorbed thought mother gone paris 
come last know three buildings invalides pantheon tower st jacques 
slowly went names pointed finger without attempting think might like nearer 
without doubt however mother settled mind pantheon astonished huge towering air like city head piece 
began question

host indefinable ideas suppositions brought verge weeping awoke trouble jeanne ignorant childish mind 
unknown world paris smoke endless noises powerful surging life odor wretchedness filth crime seemed wafted mild humid atmosphere forced avert head though leaning one pestilential pits breathe forth suffocation unseen horrors 
invalides pantheon tower saint jacques named counted knew nothing anything else sat terrified ashamed absorbing thought mother among wicked places spot unable identify depths yonder 
suddenly jeanne turned round 
could sworn somebody walked bedroom light hand even touched shoulder 
room empty still disorder helene left 
dressing gown flung across pillow still lay mournful weeping attitude 
jeanne pallid cheeks cast glance around heart nearly burst within 
alone alone heaven mother forsaking pushed force might fallen floor 
thought came back anguish seemed feel pain outrage wrists shoulders

usually spoken gentleness punishment received awoke feelings indignation within 
thrilled sensation childish fear old times threatened approach wolf looked saw lingering shady corner many things going overwhelm 
however full suspicion face paled swelled jealous fury 
sudden thought mother must love gone see far loved came upon crushing force little hands clutched bosom 
knew yes mother false

innermost recesses woman feelings aroused darted pang though received blow distance 
failing heart cried chokingly mamma mamma one could known whether called mother aid whether accused inflicted pain seemed killing 
moment tempest burst 
deep ominous stillness wind howled city shrouded darkness afterwards came long continued crashing window shutters beating fro slates flying chimney tops gutter pipes rattling pavements 
seconds calm ensued blew another gust swept along mighty strength ocean roofs seemed convulsed tossing waves disappearing whirlpool 
moment chaos reigned 
enormous clouds like huge blots ink swept host smaller ones scattered floated like shreds rag wind tore pieces carried thread thread 
second later two clouds rushed upon one another rent one another crashing reports seemed sprinkle coppery expanse wreckage every time hurricane thus veered blowing every point compass thunder opposing navies resounded atmosphere awful rending sinking followed hanging fragments clouds jagged like huge bits broken walls threatening paris imminent destruction 
rain yet falling 
suddenly cloud burst central quarters water spout ascended seine 
river green ribbon riddled stirred depths splashing drops became transformed stream mud one one behind downpor bridges appeared view slender delicately outlined mist right left trees edging gray pavements deserted quays shaken furiously wind 
away background notre dame cloud divided poured torrent water island la cite seemed submerged 
far drenched houses cathedral towers alone rose patch clear sky like floating waifs 
every side water rushed heavens 
three times succession right bank appear engulfed 
first fall inundated distant suburbs gradually extending area beating turrets saint vincent de paul saint jacques glistened rain 
two downpors following hot haste one upon streamed montmartre champs elysees 
times glimpse could obtained glass roof palace industry steaming splashing water saint augustin whose cupola swam kind fog like clouded moon madeleine spread flat roof looking like ancient court whose flagstones freshly scoured rear huge mass opera house made one think dismasted vessel hull caught two rocks resisting assaults tempest 
left bank seine also hidden watery veil perceived dome invalides spires sainte clotilde towers saint sulpice apparently melting away moist atmosphere 
another cloud spread colonnade pantheon sheets water streamed threatening inundate lay 
moment rain fell upon city directions one might imagined heavens precipitating earth streets vanished sank depths men reappeared drifting surface amidst shocks whose violence seemed foretell end city 
prolonged roar ascended roar water rushing along gutters falling drains 
last muddy looking paris assumed showers dingy yellow hue livid clouds spread uniform fashion without stain rift 
rain becoming finer falling sharply vertically whenever wind rose gray hatching curved mighty waves raindrops driven almost horizontally could heard lashing walls hissing sound till fall wind fell vertically peppering soil quiet obstinacy heights passy away level plain charenton 
vast city though overwhelmed lifeless awful convulsion seemed expanse stony ruins invisible heavens 
jeanne sunk window wailed mamma mamma terrible weariness deprived limbs strength lingered face face engulfing paris 
amidst exhaustion whilst breeze played tresses face remained wet rain preserved taste bitter pleasure made shiver within heart consciousness irretrievable woe 
everything seemed come end realized getting old 
hours might pass away even cast glance room 
forgotten alone 
despair possessed child heart around seemed black 
scolded old ill would surely wrong 
burning fever something like sick headache weighing 
surely moment ago something snapped within 
could prevent must inevitably submit whatever might fate 
besides weariness prostrating 
joined hands window bar rested head though times opened eyes gaze rain drowsiness stealing 
still ever rain kept beating livid sky seemed dissolving water 
final blast wind passed monotonous roar could heard 
amidst solemn quiescence sovereign rain poured unceasingly upon silent deserted city conquered behind sheet streaked crystal paris showed like phantom place quivering outlines seemed melting away 
jeanne scene brought nothing beyond sleepiness horrid dreams though mystery unknown evil rising vapor pierce make cough 
every time opened eyes seized fit coughing would remain seconds looking scene head fell back clung mind seemed spread crush 
rain still falling 
hour might jeanne could told 
perhaps clock ceased going 
seemed great fatigue turn round 
surely least week since mother quitted 
abandoned expectation return resigned prospect never seeing 
became oblivious everything wrongs done pain experienced even loneliness suffered remain 
weight chilly like stone fell upon 
certain unhappy ah unhappy poor little waifs gave alms huddled together gateways 
ah heaven coughing racked one penetrating cold nobody love one closed heavy eyelids succumbing feverish stupor last thoughts vague memory childhood visit mill full yellow wheat tiny grains slipping millstones huge houses 
hours hours passed away minute century 
rain beat without ceasing ever tranquil flow though time eternity allowed deluge plain 
jeanne fallen asleep 
close doll still sat astride iron window bar legs room head outside nightdress clinging rosy skin eyes glaring hair streaming water looked unlike drowned child emaciated appear comical yet distressing posture death almost brought tears pity eyes 
jeanne coughed sleep never opened eyes 
head swayed fro crossed arms cough spent wheeze without awakening 
nothing existed 
slept darkness 
even withdraw hand whose cold red fingers bright raindrops trickling one one vast expanse lay beneath window 
went hours hours 
paris slowly waning horizon like phantom city heaven earth mingled together indistinguishable jumble still ever unflagging persistency gray rain fall
