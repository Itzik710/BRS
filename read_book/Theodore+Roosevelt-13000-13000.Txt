lieutenant speaks one echelon seven companies two guns engaged th 
official report says distinctly general rubin column consisted companies detailed

page makes spanish loss las guasimas calls sevilla killed wounded 
possibly includes spanish regulars two spaniards slew left brown instead light blue regulars doubtless guerillas 
general rubin reported repulsed american attack lieutenant tejeiro states book general rubin forced americans retreat enumerates attacking force consisting three regular regiments infantry second massachusetts seventy first new york one fired gun anywhere near battle addition sixteen dismounted troops cavalry 
words five infantry regiments included twelve companies makes attacking force consist five times actual amount 
repulse line never went back ten yards place advance practically steady hour half fight began complete possession entire spanish position troops fleeing masses road men exhausted follow 
general rubin also reports lost seven men killed 
certainly incorrect captain neill went ground carefully counted eleven dead spaniards actually buried burying squads 
probably two three men missed think official reports incorrect stating forty two dead spaniards found based upon reports think spanish dead counted two three times 
indeed doubt whether loss heavy cover advanced often open main lines fled long could get close quarters 
difficult country force good soldiers resolutely handled could held pass ease two three times number 
force half regulars half volunteers drove superior number spanish regular troops strongly posted without suffering heavy loss 
although spanish fire heavy seem well directed though fired great spirit merely stood distance fired show much resolution advanced always went back long chance coming contact 
men behaved well indeed white regulars colored regulars rough riders alike 
newspaper press failed full justice white regulars opinion simple reason everybody knew would fight whereas good deal question rough riders volunteer troops tenth cavalry colored would behave tendency exalt deeds expense first regulars whose courage good conduct taken granted

note according official reports officers men kent infantry cavalry landed

words total represents total landed details etc included 
general wheeler report july th puts details fifteen per cent whole force transports eighty five per cent got forward fight 
note total spanish force santiago general linares regulars volunteers marines sailors ships 
diary british consul frederick w ramsden entry july st four thousand troops entered next day 
troops thereabouts el caney forts mouth harbor 
lieutenant tejeiro states men el caney forts mouth harbor lines counting cavalry civil guard reserve 
certainly much understates spanish force thus nowhere accounts engineers mentioned p figures would make total number spanish artillerymen 
excludes cavalry civil guard marines stationed plaza del toros yet later mentions marines brought commander bustamente severely wounded states cavalry advanced cover retreat infantry saw cavalry come forward part dismounted spaniards attempted forward movement late afternoon shot many horses later saw conversed officers men civil guard wounded time connection returning wives children latter fled city 
although engineers excluded lieutenant tejeiro mentions colonel well colonel artillery wounded 
four thousand five hundred surely understatement forces resisted attack forces wheeler 
lieutenant tejeiro careless figures 
thus one place states position san juan held two companies comprising soldiers 
later says held three companies whose strength puts thus making average instead men apiece 
mentions another echelon two companies situated cross fire others 
doubtless block house trenches fort san juan proper held three four hundred men taken sixth sixteenth infantry hawkins immediate command formed one point line hills trenches ranch houses block houses spaniards held drove 
city capitulated later unwounded troops rifles carbines surrendered time marines sailors course gone volunteers disbanded 
figures taken merely statements spanish side 
inclined think actual numbers much greater given 
lieutenant wiley book cuba shafter practically official statement states nearly spanish troops surrendered number given spaniards remarkable letter captured soldiers addressed general shafter wiley quotes full 
lieutenant tejeiro chap 
xiv explains volunteers disbanded end came marines sailors course gone nearly thousand men killed captured died wounds disease must least told 
subtracting reinforcements arrived nd would mean spaniards present st case kent wheeler opposed least equal numbers 
dealing spanish losses lieutenant tejeiro contradicts 
puts total loss day including killed missing prisoners 
yet states men caney got back remaining killed captured missing 
captured city found hospitals seriously wounded sick spaniards making inquiries found third wounded 
facts feel safe put total spanish loss battle least thousand killed wounded 
lieutenant tejeiro rightly claiming credit courage shown spaniards also praises courage resolution americans saying fought con un arrojo una decision verdaderamente admirables 
dwells repeatedly upon determination troops kept charging though unprotected cover 
spanish troops fought day freely admit courage showed 
el caney nearly hemmed made desperate defense san juan way retreat open though seven times numerous fought less desperation still gallantly 
think suffered heavily spaniards killed wounded though also captured scores prisoners 
would extraordinary reverse case charging carry earthworks foot dismounted cavalry earthworks held unbroken infantry armed best modern rifles serious task

moreover one hollow thought safe spaniards succeeded dropping shell fragment went head one men astonishing say lived although unconscious two hours afterward 
finally got eight troops settled men promptly proceeded make much home possible 
next twenty four hours however amount comfort small way protection covering blankets rain coats hammocks took dead spaniards 
ammunition course vital need brought abundance little food reached us 
afternoon enough allow man supper two hardtacks one hardtack extra every four men 
first night dug trenches sufficient length depth shelter men insure safety attack put traverses approaches arranged trenches points best places offensive work working night ground partially explored 
later engineer officer stated think work scientific assured doubt right never seen trench excepting captured spaniards heard traverse save vaguely remembered reading books 
work engaged however problem intrenchment comparatively simple work proved entirely adequate 
man regiment ever hit trenches going 
first day plenty excitement connected relieving firing line 
intense heat crowded cramped attitudes rank newly dug poisonous soil trenches men needed relieved every six hours 
accordingly late morning afternoon arranged release 
occasion waited lull firing started sudden rush relieving party tumbled trenches every way 
movement resulted occasion terrific outburst fire spanish lines proved quite harmless gradually died away men relieved got best could 
fortunately next day able abandon primitive though thrilling wholly novel military method relief 
hardtack came afternoon felt much sympathy hungry unfortunates trenches hated condemn six hours without food know get food 
little mcginty bronco buster volunteered make attempt gave permission 
simply took case hardtack arms darted toward trenches 
distance short though outburst fire actually missed 
one bullet however passed case hardtack disappeared trench 
trooper named shanafelt repeated feat later pail coffee 
another trooper george king spent leisure hour rear making soup rice stuff found spanish house brought general wood jack greenway nothing could tasted delicious 
time army trenches numbered men spaniards santiago reinforcements arrived 
nobody firing line whatever case rear felt slightest uneasiness spaniards able break plenty doubted advisability trying rush heavy earthworks wire defenses front

sharp shooters returned nightfall 
soon afterward established pickets outposts well front jungle prevent possibility surprise 
dark fires suddenly shot mountain passes far right

good deal consultation decided must signals spaniards santiago troops marching reinforce without ignorant reinforcements already reached city cubans quite unable prevent spanish regulars marching wherever wished 
thus pondering watch fires attributing spanish machinations sort appears spaniards equally puzzled setting attempt communication insurgents army 
sides accordingly alert spaniards must strengthened outlying parties jungle ahead us suddenly attacked one pickets wounding crockett seriously 
brought troopers 
evidently spanish lines felt little nervous sputter shooting immediately followed tremendous fire great guns rifles trenches batteries 
men trenches responded heavily word sent back commanders rear regiments along line spaniards attacking 
imperative see really going ran trenches looked 
night far easier place spanish lines day flame spurts shone darkness

troopers devoted would follow anywhere would anything said men get firing night rather difficult stop especially fire enemy front continues unabated 
first reached trenches impossible say whether actual night attack impending instructing men instructed mine fire low cutting grass front 
soon became convinced night attack ran line adjuring commanding troopers cease shooting words phrases doubtless wholly unlike old guard really use waterloo 
ran line could see coming saved trouble stopping fire right lines met men dropped everything listen cheer laugh

cosby badly wounded made way sea coast three days unassisted 
volunteer troops inclined think regulars time trial best work got men officers endure hardships face risks 
regiment whole cavalry division proportion loss killed wounded considerably greater among officers among troopers exactly 
moreover got hard pan officers men fared exactly alike regards shelter food 
prevented grumbling 
troopers saw officers nothing hardtack man regiment would ashamed grumble faring worse alike slept open rear trenches men always saw field officers night digging trenches going rounds outposts would tolerate number either complaint shirking work

red cross similar charitable organizations owe great deal 
also owed much colonel weston commissary department always helped us never let hindered red tape thus always let violate absurd regulation forbade even war time purchase food men stores although letting purchase officers 
course paid heed regulation violating could get beans canned tomatoes tobacco 
sometimes used money sometimes given woody kane sent brother law douglas robinson red cross people new york 
regiment fare well think fared better 
course one would minded least hardships endured need enduring none 
system sufficiency transportation needed 
one occasion foreign military attache visited head quarters together foreign correspondent turco greek war 
friendly critics knew aware correspondent finally ventured remark thought soldiers fought even better turks whole system military administration seemed rather worse greeks 
nation prided business ability adroitness arts peace outsiders rate credit us especial warlike prowess curious war came broken precisely business administrative side fighting edge troops certainly left little desired 
much touched devotion men showed 
become convinced would share hardships made point suffer hardships really extremely easy time 
whether food made difference sure certain troopers indeed certain troop messes lookout 
beans would send cupful would suddenly receive present doughnuts ex roundup cook succeeded obtaining little flour sugar man shot guinea hen could make keep half 
wright color sergeant henry bardshar orderly always pitched struck tent built bunk bamboo poles whenever changed camp 
personally endured little discomfort course one minded two three days preceding following fight get along best could 
indeed long fire immediate presence enemy plenty nothing could legitimately complain really regard hardships men object later leisure would given much complete solitude good books 
whether truce whether sometimes happened notified truce merely cessation hostilities tacit agreement whether fight kept equally vigilant watch especially night 
trenches every fourth man kept awake others sleeping beside behind rifles cossack posts pickets pushed advance beyond edge jungle 
least night irregular hour tried visit every part line especially dark rainy although sometimes lines charge officer like wilcox kane greenway goodrich became lazy took boots slept night 
sometimes night went along lines brigade brigades adjoining 
matter pride men lines occupied rough riders least vigilantly guarded lines regular regiment 
sometimes night met officers inspecting lines would sit talk matters wonder shape outcome siege would take 
knew would capture santiago exactly would could tell 
failure establish depot provisions fighting line hardly ever twenty four hours food ahead made risk serious 
hurricane struck transports scattering four winds three days heavy rain completely broken communication assuredly would done would starvation point front course would lived somehow would taken city would disagreeable experiences 
soon able accumulated regiment forty eight hours hardtack salt pork kept far possible intact provide emergency 
city could taken without direct assault intrenchments wire entanglements earnestly hoped would assault meant knew past experience loss quarter attacking regiments bound rough riders one attacking regiments attack made 
course nobody would rather assaulted run risk failure hoped city would fall without need arising us suffer great loss life assault would entailed 
naturally colonels captains nothing say peace negotiations dragged along week following sending flag truce 
day expected either see city surrender told begin fighting toward end grew irksome would welcomed even assault preference inaction 
used discuss matters officers regiment officers neighboring regiments struck friendship parker stevens beck ayres morton boughton

dorst peculiarly fitted command regiment 
although howze andrews brigade saw great deal especially howze would made nearly ideal regimental commander 
natural cavalry men enterprising natures ever desirous pushing front taking boldest course

week non fighting period truce part time passed kind nondescript arrangement told attack ready moment repulse attack make preparations meeting 
times busied putting trenches first rate shape building bomb proofs traverses 
one night got detail sixty men first ninth tenth whose officers always helped us every way sixty men dug long zigzag trench advance salient line knoll well front could command spanish trenches block houses immediately ahead us 
knoll made kind bastion consisting deep semi circular trench sand bags arranged along edge constitute wall loop holes

pickets thrown far jungle keep back spanish pickets prevent interference diggers 
men seemed think work rather good fun otherwise possibility brush spaniards lending zest prevented growing monotonous 
parker taken two gatlings removed wheels mounted trenches also mounting two automatic colts deemed could best service 
completion trenches bomb proofs traverses mounting guns fortifications hill assumed quite respectable character gatling men christened fort roosevelt name afterward went 
note see parker gatlings santiago 
truce various military attaches foreign officers came visit us 
two three newspaper men including richard harding davis caspar whitney john fox already see us trenches firing

foreign attaches always get well generals 
two english representatives never trouble heartily admired everybody indeed generally treated number seemingly regarded 
always true representatives continental europe 
one latter good fellow way altogether approved way treated climax came said good general special charge 
general question accustomed nice ethnic distinctions grouped representatives continental europe comprehensive title dutchmen 
attache question came say farewell general responded bluff heartiness perhaps note sincerity conspicuous entire good breeding well good sorry going anyhow german russian shortly midday th fighting began soon became evident spaniards much heart 
american field artillery command general randolph fought effectively 
mortar battery also established though utterly inadequate supply ammunition rendered service 
almost rough riders chance much firing men colt automatic guns twenty picked sharp shooters placed newly dug little fort extreme front 
parker splendid time gatlings colts 
machine guns completely silenced battery front us 
battery caused us good deal trouble first could place 
immediately front hospital many red cross flags flying one floating battery looked 
consequence time know hostile battery like spanish batteries using smokeless powder 
aid powerful glasses finally discovered real nature 
gatlings colts actually put action silencing big guns two field pieces 
furthermore machine guns sharp shooters together good work supplementing effects dynamite gun shell latter struck near spanish trench building spanish troops shock seemingly great spaniards almost always showed gave men chance execution 
evening th came men began make coffee sheltered places 
time knew take care well man touched spaniards second bombardment 
lying officers outside one bomb proofs saw new mexican trooper named morrison making coffee protection traverse high hill 
morrison originally baptist preacher joined regiment purely sense duty leaving wife children shown excellent soldier 
evidently exactly calculated danger zone found getting close traverse could sit erect make ready supper without cramped 
watched solemnly pounding coffee butt end revolver boiling water frying bacon lee roundup wagon somewhere plains 
noon next day th regiment one gatlings shifted right guard caney road

th city formally surrendered regiment like rest army drawn trenches 
american flag hoisted trumpets blared men cheered knew fighting part work 
shortly took new position first illinois volunteers came right 
next day result storm rain rivers roads quagmires hardly food reached front 
regiment right provided emergency illinois newcomers course done literally without anything eat 
fine fellows could see suffer 
furnished beans coffee elder officers two three cases hardtack men mounted horse rode head quarters half fording half swimming streams late evening succeeded getting half mule train provisions 
morning rd spaniards sent santiago many thousands women children non combatants belonging poorer classes among best families 
wretched creatures took little 
came lines part went el caney rear feed protect cubans 
barely enough food men rations refugees scanty indeed sufferings great 
long surrender begun come lines ask provisions men gave good deal scanty stores positively forbid insist refugees go head quarters however hard merciless seemed duty bound keep regiment highest pitch fighting efficiency 
soon surrender assured refugees came streaming back endless squalid procession caney road santiago 
troopers roughness ferocity fight rather tender hearted otherwise helped poor creatures especially women children every way giving food even carrying children burdens borne women 
saw one man happy jack spend entire day walking fro quarter mile sides lines along road carrying bundles series poor old women else carrying young children 
finally doctor warned us must touch bundles refugees fear infection disease broken rife among 
accordingly put stop acts kindness part men action happy jack respectfully strongly protested upon unexpected ground almighty would never let man catch disease good action 
venture take advanced theological stand 
vi return home two three days surrender cavalry division marched back foothills west el caney went camp together artillery 
beautiful spot beside stream clear water healthy 
fact ground neighborhood healthy 
tropics climate bad question man able take good care could live year round comparative impunity case entirely different army obliged suffer great exposure live conditions almost insured attacked severe malarial fever country 
men already suffering badly fever got worse rather better new camp 
true regiments cavalry division 
curious feature colored troops seemed suffer heavily white 
week week slight relative changes average six cavalry regiments rough riders white regulars colored regulars seemed suffer alike much weakened much regular infantry although naturally much volunteer infantry 
yet even circumstances adventurous spirits managed make way us 
fortnight following last bombardment city enlisted less nine recruits six harvard yale princeton bull former harvard oar back states crippled first fight actually got back us stowaway one transports bound share luck regiment even meant yellow fever 
twelve ambulances army quite inadequate work conditions large field hospitals bad long possible kept sick men regimental hospital front 
dr church splendid work although suffering much half time fever 
several men ranks equally well especially young doctor new york harry thorpe enlisted trooper made acting assistant surgeon 
greatest difficulty church thorpe able get proper medicine sick almost last day stay able get cots 
time lay ground 
food issued suitable half sick men doctor list two classes time included bulk command 
occasionally got hold wagon cuban carts times used improvised pack train animals however continually taken away us superiors went sent back sea coast siboney santiago get rice flour cornmeal oatmeal condensed milk potatoes canned vegetables

additional varied food utmost service merely sick preventing well becoming sick 
throughout campaign division inspector general lieutenant colonel garlington lieutenants west dickman acting division quartermaster commissary done everything power keep us supplied food mules wagons even able zealous officers could impossible 
camp policed thoroughly made men build little bunks poles sleep 
july rd ashore month able get fresh meat time fared well men already sickening 
chief trouble malarial fever recurrent 
days man would sick indeed would partially recover able go back work little time would struck 
every officer except one sickness one time another 
even greenway goodrich succumbed fever knocked days 
men indeed retained strength energy though percentage actually sick list never got twenty less fifty per cent fit kind work 
clothes rags even officers neither socks underwear 
lithe college athletes lost spring tall gaunt hunters cow punchers lounged listlessly dog tents steaming morasses torrential rains ovens sun blazed complaints 
blunder march intrenchments camp foothills surrender made heat day though five miles thereabouts nearly half men cavalry division dropped 
captain llewellen come back led troop march 
carried pick shovel one sick men reached camp walked back mule get another trooper fallen heat exhaustion 
result captain went became exceedingly sick 
last succeeded sending states 
never thought would live met montauk point practically entirely recovered 
orderly henry bardshar struck though ultimately recovered mere skeleton lost eighty pounds 
yellow fever also broke rear chiefly among cubans 
never became epidemic caused perfect panic among doctors especially minds one two generals home authorities 
found whenever sent man rear decreed yellow fever whereas kept front always turned malarial fever days back work 
doubt ever dozen genuine cases yellow fever whole cavalry division authorities washington misled reports received one two military medical advisers front became panic struck influence fears hesitated bring army home lest might import yellow fever united states 
panic absolutely groundless shown fact brought home single case yellow fever developed upon american soil 
real foe yellow fever malarial fever infectious certain troops left throughout summer cuba destroy either killing outright weakening would fallen victims disease attacked 
however time prospects gloomy washington authorities seemed determined stay cuba 
unfortunately knew nothing country circumstances army plans time time formulated department even occasional general surgeon front management army would comic possessed tragic possibilities 
thus one period proposed shift camp every two three days 
transportation pointed utterly inadequate 
theory regulations war department regiment least twenty five wagons 
matter fact regiment often none sometimes one rarely two never three yet better cavalry division 
consequence impossible carry much anything save men backs half men weak walk three miles packs 
whenever shifted camp exertion among half sick caused sick roll double next morning took least three days even shift short distance able bring officers luggage hospital spare food ammunition etc 
meanwhile officers slept wherever could men able carry bedding slept officers 
weak condition men labor pitching camp severe told heavily upon 
short scheme continually shifting camp impossible fulfilment 
would merely resulted early destruction army 
proposed go mountains make camps 
palm bamboo grew summits mountains soil along sides deep soft rains heavy much immediately coast every mile two inland bringing great increase rainfall 
could much difficulty got regiments mountains half men could got belongings would impossibility feed 
could done limited number wagons mule trains hand feed men existing camps travel rain gradually rendered road succession wholly impassable 
gone mountains would meant early starvation 
third plan department even objectionable either others 
twenty five miles interior called high interior plateau one period informed marched thither 
matter fact called high plateau sugar cane country summer rainfall prodigious 
rich deep soil covered rank tropic growth guinea grass higher head man horseback 
perfect hotbed malaria dry ground whatever camp 
sent troops would simple butchery 
circumstances alternative leaving country altogether stay hope half men would live cool season 
everything possible keep spirits men exceedingly difficult nothing 
weak languid wet heat lost energy possible indulge sports pastimes 
exceptions average man went shoot guinea hens tried vigorous game always felt much worse exertions 
twice took comrades climbed one another surrounding mountains result generally half party kind sickness next day 
impossible take heavy exercise heat day evening usually saw rain storm made country quagmire early morning drenching dew wet slimy soil made walking little pleasure 
chaplain brown held service every sunday low tree outside tent always congregation score troopers lying sitting round strong hard faces turned toward preacher

palace wood established military governor luna two three officers mexican border knew spanish sent duty 
great many men knew spanish new mexicans spanish origin although behaved precisely like members regiment 
probably spent summer sick camps losing half men hopelessly shattering health remainder general shafter summoned council officers hoping united action less public character wake washington authorities actual condition things 
spanish forces province santiago surrendered called immune regiments coming garrison conquered territory literally one thing kind whatsoever army purpose serve keeping santiago 
suppose peace hand ignorant negotiations 
anxious take part porto rico campaign would willing suffer amount sickness could get action 
take part porto rico campaign knew absolutely indispensable get commands north immediately trim great campaign havana would surely main event winter peace declared advance 
army included great majority regulars therefore flower american force 
every account imperative keep good trim keep santiago meant entirely purposeless destruction 
soon surrender accomplished fact taking away army north begun 
every officer highest lowest especially among regulars realized last day july general shafter called conference palace division brigade commanders

besides line officers chief medical officers present conference

almost regulars brought life long habits obedience without protest 
ready obey still felt quite rightly duty protest rather see flower united states forces destroyed culminating act campaign blunders committed retrieved valor splendid soldierly qualities officers enlisted men infantry dismounted cavalry 
dissenting voice could 
one side question 
talk continually shifting camp moving mountains moving interior idle one plans could carried utterly insufficient transportation season climate would merely resulted aggravating sickliness soldiers 
deemed best make record opinion shape letter report would show keep army santiago meant absolute objectless ruin recalled 
first naturally hesitation part regular officers take initiative entire future career might sacrificed 
wrote letter general shafter reading rough draft various generals adopting corrections 
finished making corrections determined send circular letter behalf us general shafter returned presenting mine found circular letter already prepared us signed 
letters made public 
result immediate

regiment officers began plan methods drilling men horseback fit use spanish cavalry go havana december 
us eyed captured spanish cavalry particular interest 
men small horses though well trained well built diminutive ponies much smaller cow ponies

thus regiment arrived tampa four days journey cars camp san antonio received food whatever twenty four hours travel rations completely exhausted food several troops purchased officers course reimbursed government 
way short one two meals time embarking port tampa transport think due failure quantity supplies lack system embarkation 
regiments information given advance transports take proceed get aboard anyone exercise supervision embarkation 
regimental commander far know left find best could dock transport taken get regiment aboard able regiment got 
regiment told go certain switch take train port tampa twelve clock midnight 
train never came 
three hours waiting sent another switch finally six clock morning got possession coal cars came 
reached quay embarkation proceeding everything utter confusion 
quay piled stores swarming thousands men different regiments besides onlookers etc 
commanding general last found told colonel wood know ship embark must find colonel humphrey quartermaster general 
colonel humphrey office nobody knew 
commanders different regiments busy trying find troops waited trains discover ships allotted ships dock mid stream 
couple hours search colonel wood found colonel humphrey allotted ship 
immediately afterward found already allotted two regiments 
coming dock 
colonel wood boarded mid stream keep possession double quicked men cars got ahead two regiments 
one regiments afterward informed spent next thirty six hours cars consequence 
suffered nothing beyond loss couple meals seems hardly put failure quantity supplies furnished troops 
two weeks troop ship yucatan given twelve days travel rations course fell short toward end trip eked things field rations troop stuff 
quality travel rations given us good except important item meat 
canned roast beef worse failure part rations effect amounts reducing rations much great majority men find uneatable 
coarse stringy tasteless disagreeable appearance unpalatable effort eat made men sick 
men preferred hungry rather eat 
cooked stew plenty onions potatoes ie one ingredient dish savory ingredients could eaten especially well salted peppered usual regard great mistake salt issued travel rations course potatoes onions 
cooking facilities transport 
men obtained bribing cook 
toward last began draw field rations eat bacon raw 
return trip difficulty rations obtained 
ie rations short men could eat canned roast beef salt 
purchased ship supplies flour pork little rice men relieve shortage much possible individual sick men helped private sources officers ate purchased santiago 
nine tenths men less sick unattractiveness travel rations doubly unfortunate

month following landing army cuba food supplies generally short quantity quality never best suited men undergoing severe hardships great exposure unhealthy tropical climate 
rations understand used klondike 
connection call especial attention report captain brown made orders brigade commander herewith appended 
also call attention report quartermaster 
usually received full rations bacon hardtack 
hardtack however often mouldy parts cases even whole cases could used 
bacon usually good 
bacon hardtack make poor food men toiling fighting trenches midsummer sun tropics 
ration coffee often short sugar generally rarely got vegetables 
circumstances men lost strength steadily fever speedily attacked suffered reduced bacon hardtack diet 
much shortage proper food tell upon health officers compelled draw upon private purses upon red cross society make good deficiency government supply 
sent improvised pack trains composed officers horses captured spanish cavalry ponies mules shot abandoned cured men 
expeditions sometimes chaplain sometimes quartermaster sometimes occasionally trooper would go sea coast red cross head quarters surrender city santiago get food well sick 
red cross society rendered invaluable aid 
example one expeditions personally brought pounds beans another occasion personally brought pounds rice pounds cornmeal pounds sugar pounds tea pounds oatmeal barrels potatoes two onions cases canned soup condensed milk sick hospitals 
every scrap food thus brought eaten avidity soldiers put new heart strength 
constant care men way enabled us keep trim 
sick hospital unless able outside sources get simple delicacies rice condensed milk usually alternative eating salt pork hardtack going without 
fight got good deal food spanish camps way beans peas rice together green coffee men used relished greatly 
respects spanish rations preferable notably use rice 
ashore month supplies began come abundance fared well 
time men fed weeks heaviest drain made upon vitality deficiency partially supplied aid red cross officers pockets pockets various new york friends sent us money 
immediately fights june th july st short even bacon hardtack

regimental pack train left behind tampa

whenever shifted camp leave things behind night fight marked sleeping without tentage little food far officers concerned everything sacrificed getting ammunition medical supplies 
colonel wood seized mules manner got medical supplies fight june th three days officers nothing wore 
repetition worse form fight july st course much simply natural incident war great deal could readily avoided enough transportation sorry let men comfortable possible rest much possible going fight july st nd might forty eight hours minimum quantity food sleep 
fever began make heavy ravages among men surrender time became serious matter shift camp sick ailing soldiers hardly able walk speak carrying heavy burdens transportation 
half men could carry rolls yet officers baggage provisions entire hospital appurtenances etc transported somehow 
usually three days reached new camp necessaries left behind could brought three days get along best could 
entire lack transportation first resulted leaving troop mess kits beach never able get 
men cooked utensils could carry 
rendered impossible boil drinking water 
closely allied lack transportation lack means land supplies transports

mr stephen bonsal however book fight santiago cast one permanent form shall discuss one two statements 
mr bonsal present fight indeed far know never time cavalry action 
puts book map supposed skirmish ground bears actual scene fight well known likeness borne monmouth macedon 
brook battle ground brook mr bonsal map 
real brook flowing mountains crossed valley road ran hill trail going nowhere near latter 
bonsal brook flows right angles course real brook crosses trails runs hill 
difficult believe bonsal map could made man gone hill trail followed rough riders knew fighting taken place 
position spanish line bonsal map inverted compared really 
page mr bonsal says making precipitate advance rivalry regulars rough riders resulted hurrying recklessly forward strike spaniards first 
contrary 
official reports show general young column waited time got spanish position allow rough riders difficult trail come 
colonel wood kept column walking smart pace merely regulars might left unsupported fight began matter fact began almost simultaneously wings 
page mr bonsal speaks foolhardy formation solid column along narrow trail brought rough riders within point blank range spanish rifles within unobstructed sweep machine guns 
also speaks advance made regiment deployed jungle 
course possible way rough riders could brought action time support regulars advancing column along trail good smart gait 
soon advance guard came contact enemy outpost deployed 
firing began least five minutes captain capron sent back word come upon spanish outpost 
particular point occurred dip road probably rendered capron opinion better keep part men 
event captain capron skilful gallant ample time discovering spanish outpost outbreak firing arrange troop formation deemed best 
troop solid formation men ten yards apart 
course walked forward deployed jungle prior reaching ground fight would course procedure foolish warrant summary court martial man directing 
could made half mile hour formation would least four hours late fighting 
page mr bonsal says captain capron troop ambushed received enemy fire quarter hour expected 
simply 
column stopped passed dead cuban killed preceding day skirmish general wood notified information received capron might come contact spaniards moment already said captain capron discovered spanish outpost halted partially deployed column firing began 
time exactly expected come across spaniards 
mr bonsal speaking l troop adds remaining troops regiment traveled leisurely half hour elapsed came capron support 
matter fact troops traveled exactly rate speed although stragglers capron halted sent back word come upon spanish outpost entire regiment closed halted men sat 
minutes first word received firing begun received instructions deploy 
right wing partially deployed first shots outposts took place 
within less three minutes g troop llewellen greenway leahy one platoon k troop kane firing line reached firing line heavy volley firing spaniards began 
page mr bonsal says vexatious delay occurred two independent columns could communicate advance concerted action 
two columns brought communication immediately decided make general attack upon spanish position purpose view following disposition troops made advance brigade along line ordered 
communication two columns prior general attack order issued advance brigade along line 
attacks made wholly independently first communication columns right wing rough riders course advance firing dislodged spaniards hill across ravine right saw regulars come hill 
mr bonsal account occurred among regulars parallels account occurred among rough riders 
states squadron tenth cavalry delivered main attack upon hill strongest point spanish position says troopers tenth cavalry better training enabled render valuable service troops engaged 
reality tenth cavalrymen deployed support first though mingled assault proper far difference amount work done favor first 
statement tenth cavalry better trained first rendered valuable service slightest basis whatsoever kind sort description fact 
tenth cavalry well required organization fight rather less heavily engaged suffered less loss actually relatively either first cavalry rough riders 
took part taken left wing rough riders wing similarly rather less heavily engaged right center regiment 
course reflection neither tenth cavalry left wing rough riders 
body simply ordered well 
claim tenth cavalry better first bore prominent part fight like making claim left wing rough riders 
troops engaged well alike entitled share honor day 
mr bonsal spaniards spaniards regards numbers loss 
points discussed elsewhere 
develops spanish side account retreat wholly new explanation viz retreated saw reinforcements arriving americans 
spaniards make claim 
lieutenant tejeiro asserts retreated news come wholly mythical american advance morro castle 
spanish official report simply says americans repulsed accurate statement two 
three explanations general rubin lieutenant tejeiro mr bonsal alike precisely par first spanish official report battle manila bay admiral dewey described repulsed forced retire 
one two minor mistakes made mr bonsal 
states roster officers rough riders ten west pointers 
three one resigned 
two fighting 
also states las guasimas brigadier general young made major general colonel wood brigadier general commanding officers first tenth cavalry ignored shower promotions 
first place commanding officers first tenth cavalry fight one squadron present 
next place shower promotions 
nobody promoted except general young save fill vacancies caused death promotion general young 
wood promoted fight 
general young deservedly promoted 
soon fight fell sick 
command brigade fell upon wood simply higher rank two regimental commanders brigade took command regiment exactly lieutenant colonels veile baldwin already taken command first tenth cavalry superior officers put charge brigades 
san juan fighting wood commanded brigade made brigadier general promoted nominal command regiment already commanding reality 
mr bonsal claim superior efficiency colored regular regiments compared white regular regiments merit discussion 
asserts general wheeler brought guasimas fight defiance orders 
lieutenant miley book cuba shafter page shows general wheeler made fight receiving order claimed disobeyed 
general wheeler command ashore told get touch enemy man fighting edge meant certain fight 
general worth salt would failed fight conditions question would fight made 
war means fighting soldier cardinal sin timidity 
general wheeler remained throughout steadfast retreat santiago
