myles ussher 
every one knows ireland sins maintains two distinct regularly organised bodies police duties one prevent distillation potheen illicit whiskey check riots created consumption 
forces fact military forces officers sub officers privates army dress full dress half dress arms field arms house arms barracks stations military regulations captains colonels commander chief called names fact body regularly disciplined force differing standing army carried expensive manner 
first preventing distillation potheen commonly called revenue police time story honored services myles ussher 
held office one sub inspectors county leitrim resided town mohill body five twenty men sergeant duty said prevent distillation potheen 
done seizing made process making considerable portion fine levied cases possible dealers trade became perquisite sub inspector officer effecting seizure situation wild lawless district one considerable emolument consequently gentlemen repute good family glad get sons service present time commission revenue police considered fashionable rate lucrative appointment commission army 
among officers course would active others would consequently make money easily imagined however much activity sub inspector revenue police might add character standing headquarters would likely make popular neighborhood resided 
myles ussher active situation filled whether impartial judge would said much would question difficult settle impartial judge subject refer persons among lived thought 
time allude ten years ago great deal whiskey distilled mountains running counties leitrim cavan different parts county leitrim 
father mathew pledge unknown district wild country much favored gentlemen residences poor though may seem anomaly always found case poorer people drink consequently captain ussher usually called neighborhood found sufficient occupation men 
case different revenue police remain duties districts gone may seen patrolling roads officers accompanying bound walk many miles day 
seldom one hears effecting seizure inactivity doubt owing prevalence father mathew pledge total abstinence 
myles ussher protestant county antrim north ireland illegitimate son gentleman large property procured situation held tolerably well educated could read write sufficiently understood somewhat nature figures learned since utterly forgotten latin grammar 
natural abilities somewhat par good looking strongly made possessed kind courage arises animal spirits yet experienced evil effects danger real capabilities enduring consequences 
myles ussher never yet hit duel would therefore hesitation fighting one never yet seriously injured riding would therefore ride horse boldly never head broken row therefore would readily go one cared little bodily pain incapacitate little least pain yet endured imagination strong enough suggest worse evil 
kind courage species far generally met sufficient life lead 
quality ussher chiefly excelled conducive give character certainly held country courage talent gallantry self confidence assurance 
believed inferior none powers body mind could accomplish whatever perseveringly attempted 
moreover overwhelming contempt poor amongst duties constantly brought therefore wonderful equally feared execrated 
also state myles ussher sagacity enough keep money received added little reputation standing country also real power possessed connaught ready money scarce scarcity creates importance 
feemy lover certainly love dearly chief ornaments novel heroes handsome carried arms man danger talked deeds courage wore uniform rode gracefully talked fluently seemed mighty personage one feemy usually met 
besides gloried title captain would sufficient engage heart girl feemy position let alone irish girl ornaments arms always dear 
whether loved truly might fear considered doubtful married larry macdermot broken hearted man low spirited objected myles ground protestant indifferent religion heart enough left energetic subject 
respects myles match daughter present fallen condition family 
matter even mentioned daughter lover 
ussher constantly ballycloran habit riding mohill three miles almost daily disengaged giving horse patsy male attendant ballycloran staying whole morning evening without invitation larry never seemed particularly glad rate never evinced dislike visits 
whatever war sub inspector might wage run spirits mountains bogs always appeared good terms ballycloran macdermots little else give way hospitality well 
young thady could see sister attached ussher knew could better marry considered much thought taking fun girls would come right 
thady warmly attached sister one else really love sullen prospects gloomy situation chosen loved one expend heart disposition saturnine though irishman go look love fall way give gave sister 
must remembered poor thady refinement though would let one injure feemy could help hardly knew effectually protect 
suspicions aroused counsellor pat brady effect rather create increased dislike ussher give rise properly concerted scheme sister welfare 
evening previous fair mohill mentioned last chapter captain ussher party men succeeded making seizure half malted barley cabin margin little lake low mountains lay mohill cashcarrigan

employment captain ussher made acquainted instead seizing man whilst possession whiskey sounded finding sufficiently villain taken pay spy trade cogan found lucrative even former also dangerous detected might reckon death certain 
still continued buy spirits people smaller quantities offered lower prices though nominally kept trade purpose knowing potheen buying selling 
wonderful therefore seizures ever lately made men getting cautious time irate violent language

though zeal enabled raise money church could never keep always little difficulties though sedulously strove live within income never really much outstripped always want money 
built house unlike neighbor managed pay always trouble rats roof flooring warped windows would neither open shut damp would get books

chapter xiv 
denis govery tidings 
soon finished breakfast morning night events recorded father john took hat stick walked drumsna still charitably intent finding means soften could avert storm saw must follow scenes witnessed previous evening 
ussher would considered want pluck stay away thady told feemy also would encourage visits would lean lover brother especially father attempted make aware state case would sure take feemy part 
father john felt would impossible induce old man desire ussher discontinue visits confident unless captain would take advantage unfortunate state affairs ballycloran consider invited guest spite efforts thady might make induce leave 
priest feared unfortunate girl would induced go lover knew circumstances would never marry present object take way temptation 
father john gave feemy credit principles feelings sufficiently high prevent falling immediately vice time feared strong influence ussher might easily persuade leave home partly promising early time marry partly threatening desertion 
thought present domiciled mrs mckeon ussher might brought hear reason made understand contented propose marry feemy proper decent manner must altogether drop acquaintance 
far wrong estimate formed characters 
though ussher loved feemy perhaps well ever likely love woman circumstances might easily induced give 
impediments way opposition met would give affair fresh interest eyes 
certainly intend marry poor girl sufficient tact might perhaps persuaded fervent love perfect confidence though gratifying vanity inspire feeling respect man would wish girl going marry 
say premeditated object persuade leave home father john far wrong fearing unless steps taken prevent would probable termination whole affair 
regard feemy quite right thinking love ussher strong enough induce take almost step might desire love joined obstinacy determined resistance advice listened render unlikely induced give though well understood weakness character aware opportunity trying strength

strong feeling father john give heroine credit still felt headstrong enough make difficult task manage way 
charity unbounded zeal courage great 
present plan induce friend mrs mckeon ask feemy come spend time daughters drumsna 
difficulties first place although feemy miss mckeons good friends still reports lately afloat affairs family might make mrs mckeon prudent woman unwilling comply priest wishes though indeed often contradicted anything talked mrs mckeon aroused charitable feelings excited good nature tell truth never dormant bosom difficult task persuading feemy accept invitation 
ordinary circumstances would willing enough go mrs mckeon present would likely suspect double meaning everything 
father john already mentioned mrs mckeon name reference attachment ussher probable brought invitation lady would perceive object separate lover would obstinately persist remaining ballycloran 
father john entering drumsna met curate cullen mcgovery considering married evening dancing kept guests till four five morning left bride rather early according custom slept first night wedding wife house though ten clock visit father cullen eagerly talking
