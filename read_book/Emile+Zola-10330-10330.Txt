began challenging impartiality boutan knew fervent partisan large families 
made merry declaring medical man could possibly disinterested opinion subject 
brought vaguely knew malthusianism geometrical increase births arithmetical increase food substances earth becoming populous reduced state famine within two centuries 
poor fault said led life starvation limit many children could provide

moreover one day like another morning set live life afresh never failing happiness 
day though visit said madame lepailleur woman mill yonder came tell fine chickens sale 
owe twelve francs eggs milk believe simply called see meant pay 
told would go place morrow 
speaking marianne pointed gloom towards big black pile little way yeuse 
old water mill still worked lepailleurs installed three generations 
last francois lepailleur considered fool come back military service little inclination work idea mill would never enrich enriched father grandfather 
occurred marry peasant farmer daughter victoire cornu whose dowry consisted neighboring fields skirting yeuse 
young couple lived fairly ease produce fields small quantities corn peasants district still brought ground old mill 
antiquated badly repaired mechanism mill replaced modern appliances land instead impoverished adherence old fashioned practices fallen hands intelligent man believed progress would doubt fortune 
lepailleur disgusted work treated soil contempt 
indeed typified peasant grown weary eternal mistress mistress forefathers loved much 
remembering spite efforts fertilize soil never made rich happy ended hating 
faith powers departed accused lost fertility used decrepit like old cow one sends slaughter house 
according everything went wrong soil simply devoured seed sown weather never seasons longer came proper order 
briefly premeditated disaster brought evil power spite peasantry foolish give sweat blood thankless creature 
madame lepailleur brought boy little fellow three years old called antonin resumed marianne fell talking children together 
quite surprised 
peasant folks know used large families 
declared one child quite enough

elected otherwise setting egotism pride son death snatched away motherhood longed denied 
nearly two years constance battle last despair seized idea consulting dr gaude 
told brutal truth useless address charlatans would simply robbed absolutely hope 
gaude uttered decisive words light jesting way though surprised amused profound grief

evening came complete rupture husband 
threw beauchene face contempt loathing felt years 
hopeless revenged telling everything heart mind 
slim dark figure upborne bitter rage assumed redoubtable proportions eyes felt frightened fled 
henceforth husband wife name
