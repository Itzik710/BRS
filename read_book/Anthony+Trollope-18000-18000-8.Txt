combatants felt without daring announce hope subject among present arena trial ground possible greater amphitheatre future debating club debates would lead action eloquence would power even though persuasion might question

lord well go 
never taken much part politics know boy phineas side

clergyman ireland stauncher given deanery kilfenora man never father though condescended ask cousin 
let wait till ask anything 
dr finn knew dick morris debts heard modes preaching surprised decision conservative bestower irish church patronage subject said nothing 
george continued earl never lift hand 
standing loughshane would quite question 
tenants vote ask 
peter blake mr peter blake lord agent told week ago would useless 
whole thing gone part wish disenfranchise borough 
wish disenfranchise whole country send us military governor 
use members send one gentleman among ten 
son welcome

suppose better come see 
doctor promised son ride castlemorris took leave specially flattered felt son returned earl would regard one gentleman among ten county might send leaven remainder members aware greatest impediment son way already removed 
certainly gone castlemorris idea canvassing son yet canvassed satisfactorily 
got home know speak matter otherwise triumphantly wife daughters 
though desired curse mouth would speak blessings 
evening prospects phineas loughshane spoken open enthusiasm doctor next day post letter written matilda informing earl prepared receive open arms 
papa managed said matilda 
told george morris going stand said barrington erle phineas night departure 
brother support 
brother means support said phineas 
hardly 
tell 
father known earl twenty years managed 
say finn going play us trick said mr erle something like dismay voice 
sort trick coming side know said phineas proudly 
let assure change views politics either earl though carried seats breeches pockets 
go parliament shall go sound liberal support party best country 
tell shall tell earl 
barrington erle turned away disgust 
language simply disgusting 
fell upon ears false maudlin sentiment falls ears ordinary honest man world 
barrington erle man ordinarily honest 
would untrue mother brother william mildmay great whig minister day earthly consideration 
ready work wages without wages 
really zealous cause asking much 
undefined belief much better country mr mildmay power lord de terrier 
convinced liberal politics good englishmen liberal politics mildmay party one thing 
would unfair barrington erle deny praise patriotism 
hated name independence parliament told man man intended look measures men regarded man unstable water dishonest wind 
good could possibly come one much evil might probably would come 
politician greek barrington erle whose hands feared accept even gift vote 
parliamentary hermits distasteful dwellers political caves regarded aversion either knavish impractical 
good conservative opponent could shake hands almost readily good whig ally man neither flesh fowl odious 
according theory parliamentary government house commons divided marked line every member required stand one side 
rate would said every representative people name great leader followed 
thought debates good people outside served create public opinion hereafter used creating future house commons think possible vote given great question either way result debate certainly assured opinion changing votes would dangerous revolutionary almost unparliamentary 
member vote except small crotchety open question thrown amusement crotchety members due leader member party 
mr erle idea english system parliament lending semi official assistance frequently introduction candidates house naturally anxious candidates candidates heart 
therefore phineas finn talked measures men barrington erle turned away open disgust 
remembered youth extreme rawness lad remembered also careers men 
barrington erle forty experience taught something 
seconds brought think mildly young man vanity vanity plunging colt resents liberty even touch 
end first session thong cracked head patiently assists pulling coach hill without producing even flick tail said barrington erle old parliamentary friend 
come wrong side said parliamentary friend 
erle admitted trick would unpleasant thought old lord tulia hardly equal clever stratagem 
phineas went ireland walked course loughshane 
called upon lord tulla heard venerable nobleman talk great deal nonsense 
tell truth phineas must confess wished talk nonsense earl would hear put quickly 
discuss politics please mr finn already said throwing aside political considerations 
phineas therefore allowed express views government country earl sitting room castlemorris 
however good time coming present allowed earl ramble sins brother george want proper pedigree part new dean kilfenora 
conference ended assurance part lord tulla loughshaners chose elect mr phineas finn would least offended 
electors elect mr phineas finn perhaps reason given one dublin conservative papers declared fault carlton club sending proper candidate 
great deal said matter london dublin blame supposed fall joint shoulders george morris elder brother 
meantime hero phineas finn duly elected member parliament borough loughshane 
finn family could restrain triumphings killaloe know would natural done 
gosling flock become something real swan getting parliament 
doctor misgivings great misgivings fearful forebodings young man elected could help 
could refuse right hand son withdraw paternal assistance son specially honored among young men country 
pulled hoard sufficed pay outstanding debts heavy undertook allow phineas two hundred fifty pounds year long session last

chapter iii phineas finn takes seat phineas many serious almost solemn thoughts journey towards london 
sorry must assure female readers reference mary flood jones 
however carefully packed tress could bring proper acts erotic worship seasons mind might less engaged affairs state present 
would make failure great matter taken hand could tell chances twenty one 
looked nearer difficulties loomed larger ever rewards seemed less difficult approach evanescent 
many members could never get hearing many spoke fail many spoke well could speak effect far worldly prospects concerned already known many members parliament outward respect sign honor ever given one seemed thought irish members parliament generally treated indifference others 
b c one cared straw could hardly get men dine club yet genuine members parliament 
ever better b c way begin better idea fashion would duty strive might excel gentlemen 
give credit much earnestness country behalf minded earnest 
would go work honestly conscientiously determined duty best might let results would 
noble resolution might pleasant remembered smile derision come friend erle face declared intention duty country liberal supporting party 
b c keen enough support party sometimes little astray knowing party nonce 
knew erle men would despise fall regular groove barrington erles despised would left moody thoughts somewhat dissipated found one laurence fitzgibbon honourable laurence fitzgibbon special friend clever fellow board boat steamed kingston harbor 
laurence fitzgibbon also election returned matter course father county 
laurence fitzgibbon sat house last fifteen years yet well nigh young man 
man altogether different b c laurence fitzgibbon could always get ear house chose speak friends declared might high office long since would taken trouble work 
welcome guest houses best people friend one might proud 
two years feather cap phineas knew laurence fitzgibbon 
yet people said laurence fitzgibbon nothing men wondered lived 
youngest son lord claddagh irish peer large family could nothing laurence favorite child beyond finding seat parliament 
well finn boy said laurence shaking hands young member board steamer made right loughshane 
phineas beginning tell story wonderful story george morris earl tulla men loughshane elected without opposition supported conservatives well liberals unanimous loughshane electing phineas finn representative 
mr fitzgibbon seemed care little went far declare things accidents fell sometimes one way sometimes another altogether independent merit demerit part candidate 
marvellous almost painful phineas friend fitzgibbon accept fact membership little congratulation absolutely blowing trumpets whatever 
elected member municipal corporation loughshane instead representative british parliament laurence fitzgibbon could made less fuss 
phineas disappointed took cue friend quickly show disappointment 
half hour meeting fitzgibbon reminded companion house last session phineas able make remark though thought little house old accustomed member 
far see yet said fitzgibbon sure seventeen 
seventeen said phineas quite understanding meaning number quoted 
majority seventeen 
four irish counties three scotch returned yet know pretty well 
doubt tipperary course whichever gets seven standing vote side 
government live 
uphill strain much 
according idea nothing justify trying live majority 
gammon 
thing equal anything fair 
see like 
course among hungry dubby would give toes fingers remain 
dubby ordinary name among friends foes mr daubeny known mr daubeny time leader conservative party house commons 
continued mr fitzgibbon prefer game care money upon word pleasanter game two 
country gets nothing done tory government 
six one half dozen 
never knew government yet wanted anything 
give government real strong majority tories used half century since matter course nothing 
things call bidding power patronage pay 
country service done country gets quite much service pays perhaps little 
clerks offices work country 
ministers work got anything manage 
plenty work done work parliament less better according ideas 
little ever done little generally much 
people come glass brandy water leave people alone present 
people take care great deal better take care 
mr fitzgibbon doctrine commonwealth different barrington erle still less taste new member 
barrington erle considered leader mr mildmay intrusted make necessary changes laws obedient house commons implicitly obey leader authorising changes proposed according barrington erle changes numerous great importance would duly passed law lord behest gradually produce whig utopia england never yet seen face earth 
according mr fitzgibbon present utopia would good enough might put possession certain semi political place court heretofore drawn per annum without work much comfort 
made secret ambition chagrined simply prospect return electors could enjoy good things expected receive undoubted majority seventeen would achieved 
hate change rule said fitzgibbon upon word ought alter 
fellow got crumb comfort waiting years years perhaps spending thousands elections go back try hand last moment merely obedience antiquated prejudice 
look poor jack bond best friend ever world 
wrecked upon rock ever 
spent every shilling contesting romford three times running three times running got 
made vice comptroller granaries shot get spilt romford standing election became god knows 
think heard married old woman settled somewhere 
know never came 
call confounded shame 
suppose safe mayo knowing may happen days 
parted euston square phineas asked friend little nervous question best mode making first entrance house

must rate go lord brentford dinner wednesday enable join conversation must attend debates monday tuesday 
reader may perhaps best made understand terrible hero state doubt told awhile thought absenting debates likely weaken purpose withdrawing altogether house 
often strong fury rages party party commencement session division taken upon address 
customary leader opposition occasions express opinion courteous language right honorable friend sitting opposite treasury bench wrong everything thinks says public life anything like factious opposition never adopted side house address queen answer fatuous speech put majesty gracious mouth shall allowed pass unquestioned 
leader house thanks adversary consideration explains men happy country ought government fallen disgracefully incapable hands right honorable friend opposite address carried amidst universal serenity 
order day present occasion 
mr mildmay veteran leader liberal side house moved amendment address urged upon house strong language expediency showing commencement session country returned parliament strong majority determined put conservative inactivity 
conceive duty mr mildmay said assume country unwilling right honorable gentlemen opposite keep seats bench upon sit performance duty called upon divide house upon address majesty 
mr mildmay used strong language reader may sure mr mildmay followers used language much stronger 
mr daubeny present leader house representative ministry lord de terrier premier sitting house lords man allow amenities pass without adequate replies 
friends strong sarcasm failed argument lacked nothing words though might perhaps proved short numbers 
considered speech mr daubeny reviewed long political life mr mildmay showed mr mildmay one time bugbear nightmare latterly simply fungus one severest attacks severe heard house since reform bill 
mr mildmay sitting hat low eyes many men said like

nobody house least found nobody within half hour phineas walking grounds 
mr ratler declared delighted opportunity writing letters doubt writing dozen dated loughlinter detailing facts mr gresham mr monk plantagenet palliser lord brentford house 
phineas letters write therefore rushed across broad lawn river heard noisy tumbling waters 
something air immediately filled high spirits desire investigate glories place forgot going dine four cabinet ministers row 
soon reached stream began make way ravine 
waterfall waterfall little bridges looked half natural half artificial path required climb yet path arranged pleasant splashing rush waters lost visitor

took ravine side mountain another path woods back house 
went relapsed usual silence conversation kept two 
point far castle far one could see break ground castle stood kennedy left 
mr finn take back safety sure said go farm moment 
show think indifferent bestials 
mr kennedy said lady laura going pretend understand sheep oxen 
mr kennedy owning went away farm phineas lady laura returned towards house 
think upon whole said lady laura good man know 
think idle one said phineas 
doubt 
perhaps neither zealous active 
thoughtful high principled method purpose use makes money 
see poetry nature get upon right string 
fond scenery place man would fond 
ashamed say almost makes envy 
certainly never wished mr robert kennedy london like laird loughlinter 
laird linn laird linter summer gone winter 
ballad old lairds belongs time mr kennedy heard branch mackenzies lived wretched old tower see first come upon lake 
old mr kennedy bought hardly hundred acres property cultivation

mr kennedy old man first called loughlinter 
linn castle lived hundreds years 
highlanders said family pride forgotten mackenzies already quite proud rich landlord 
unpoetical said phineas 
yes poetry usually false 
doubt whether scotland would prosaic country sun walter scott doubt henry v owes romance character altogether shakspeare 
sometimes think despise poetry said phineas 
false

tom moore always false 
false byron said phineas energy 
much friend 
discuss 
seen mr monk since seen one 
came mr ratler 
mr ratler find mr ratler companion much taste 
chance brought us together 
mr ratler man sense lady laura despised 
always seems said lady laura nothing gained politics sitting feet little gamaliels 
great gamaliels novice footstools 
sit man feet 
astonishing price generally put upon article world owner puts specially true man self herd ratler men take granted ratlerite 
consort greshams pallisers equally supposed know place 
never knew mentor said phineas apt fill telemachus pride 
think fault lies way 
thought telemachus may sure resign position mentor 
mr kennedy lady glencora mrs gresham steps 
went ionic columns broad stone terrace door found crowd men women 
legislators statesmen written letters ladies taken necessary rest 
phineas dressing considered deeply lady laura said much reference advice given though also importance fact given 
first called mentor accepted name addressed telemachus 
yet believed older indeed difference ages 
possible female mentor love telemachus love phineas desired loved lady laura would say impossible 
perhaps mistakes mistake manner addressing another addressing 
perhaps old bachelor forty three thinking wife 
old bachelor forty three really love lady laura would allowed walk home alone phineas leaving flimsy pretext look sheep phineas resolved must rate play game whether lose win playing must possible drop something mentor telemachus style conversation 
advice given herding greshams pallisers instead ratlers fitzgibbons must use circumstances might direct 
thought sufficiently astonishing even ratlers fitzgibbons admit among one 
think father old house killaloe remember hitherto done nothing understand loughlinter 
one way understanding 
lady laura really loved riddle might read 
rooms loughlinter splendid much larger much richly furnished saulsby 
certain stiffness movement things perhaps manner present felt saulsby 
phineas missed grace prettiness cheery audacity violet effingham felt time violet effingham would element loughlinter 
loughlinter met business 
least semi political perhaps rather semi official gathering became aware ought look simply amusement 
entered drawing room dinner mr monk mr palliser mr kennedy mr gresham sundry others standing wide group fireplace among lady glencora palliser lady laura mrs bonteen 
approached seemed though sort opening made could see though others movement came lady laura 
believe mr monk said lady glencora two whole party really know would 
must divided many friends said mr monk happy go astray company lady glencora palliser 
might ask said mr gresham peculiar smile famous mr monk really making men women equal said lady glencora 
take gist political theory 
lady glencora must cry said mr monk 
yes doubt 
cabinet admit much 
reticences course 
official discretion 
mean say lady glencora would really advocate equality said mrs bonteen 
mean say mrs bonteen 
mean go tell liberal heart unless likewise unless basis political aspirations 
pray let speak lady glencora 
means criticising politics 
wish make lower orders comfortable certainly said mrs bonteen 
educated happy good undoubtedly 
make comfortable good better possible 
sure wish make good comfortable anybody else anybody admit yes understand 
admitted everything advocate general equality mr monk 
getting mr kennedy dinner announced mr kennedy walked french republican arm 
went whispered mr kennedy ear understand 
saying people equal tendency law making governing reduce inequalities 
answer mr kennedy said word 
lady glencora politics fast furious nature 
week passed loughlinter end phineas found terms friendly intercourse political magnates assembled house especially mr monk 
determined would follow lady laura advice selection companions driven even seeming intrusion 
made attempt sit feet anybody would stand aloof bigger men talking content less indeed less mr bonteen mr ratler 
end week found without effort part almost opposition efforts part fallen easy pleasant way men delightful 
killed stag company mr palliser stopped beneath crag discuss question duty irish malt 
played chess mr gresham told gentleman opinion trial mr jefferson davis 
lord brentford last called finn proved nothing known ireland sheep 
mr monk long discussions abstract questions politics week almost disposed call disciple least follower mr monk 
mr monk well one else mr monk cabinet members cabinet advanced liberal 
lady glencora far wrong night mr monk said 
equality ugly word used 
misleads frightens bugbear 
using perhaps clearly defined meaning mind 
wish every honest man assist lifting till something nearer level finds 
phineas assented degrees found assenting great many things mr monk said 
mr monk thin tall gaunt man devoted whole life politics hitherto without personal reward beyond came reputation name honor seat parliament 
one four five brothers besides trade 
prospered trade whereas prospered solely politics men said dependent altogether relatives supplied support 
parliament twenty years known radical democrat 
ten years since risen fame repute among men governed england nobody dreamed joshua monk would ever paid servant crown 
inveighed one minister another though deserved impeachment 
advocated political doctrines time seemed altogether variance possibility governing according english rules government 
regarded pestilent thorn sides ministers 
member cabinet terrified old days began find much unlike men 
horses put harness highest spirit generally work best 
phineas eyes thought could perceive mr palliser shoot deer mr ratler mr gresham played chess mr bonteen 
bonteen indeed noisy pushing man nobody seemed like phineas wondered loughlinter office 
friend laurence fitzgibbon indeed endeavored explain 
man vote hard call speak words wanted without ambition way may always price 
pretty wife bargain ought pleasant time 
mr ratler doubt useful man thoroughly knew business yet seemed phineas great distinction shown mr ratler loughlinter 
got high said think miracle luck 
yet nobody seems think anything ratler 
nothing unless one go top 
believe right accept office mr monk said one day sat together rock close one little bridges linter 
indeed unless man bonds office tendered made compatible views declines proceed open path towards prosecution views 
man combating one ministry another striving imbue ministers convictions hardly decline become minister finds convictions henceforth least time come ministerial convictions day 
follow clearly said phineas 
would denied children refused 
unless indeed man feel way unfitted office work 
nearly provided escape plea came sift thought would false 
let tell delight political life altogether opposition 
freedom slavery fire clay movement stagnation inaccuracy permitted opposition charm worth patronage prestige ministerial power 
try say agree 
give full swing benches gangway needed care one could always enjoy legs long felt true sent 
got harness shoulders sore

mr mildmay made another speech 
gist whole thing reform bill generous enlargement franchise ballot

evidently expected speak seconds sat waiting might say 
last found incumbent begin

ever hunt oh yes home county clare 
irishmen hunt

phineas thought proposition answered made reply made 
would lady laura money hunting england 
alas alas said smiling 
hits one every side might manage couple days march

hear mr kennedy 
papa told 
still see papa almost every day 
must call upon 
mind 
phineas said certainly would 
papa lonely sometimes feel almost cruel deserting 
think horror house especially later year always fancying meet oswald 
unhappy mr finn 
brother marry said phineas knowing nothing yet lord chiltern violet effingham 
marry well would bring father round 
yes would 
lady laura paused answered told whole story 
violently love girl loves refused twice 
miss effingham asked phineas guessing truth remembering miss effingham said riding wood 
yes violet effingham father pet favorite loves next almost well would really welcome daughter 
would gladly make mistress house saulsby 
everything would go smoothly 
like lord chiltern believe loves heart afraid 
says girl bound careful 
seeming frolic violet effingham wise 
phineas though conscious anything akin jealousy annoyed revelation made 
since heard lord chiltern love miss effingham like lord chiltern quite well done 
simply admired miss effingham taken pleasure society though like hear another man wanting marry almost angry lady laura saying believed miss effingham loved brother 
miss effingham twice refused lord chiltern ought sufficient 
phineas love miss effingham 
still violently love lady laura love course impossible nevertheless something offensive story told 
wisdom part said answering lady laura last words find fault decision 
find fault think brother would make happy 
lady laura left alone reverted tone phineas finn answered remarks miss effingham 
phineas ill able conceal thoughts wore heart almost upon sleeve 
possible cares nature lady laura first question upon matter 
asking question thought nothing disparity rank fortune phineas finn violet effingham 
occur improbable violet might accept love lately lover 
idea grated wishes two sides 
anxious violet ultimately become brother wife could pleased phineas able love woman 
must beg readers carried away last words erroneous conclusion 
must suppose lady laura kennedy lately married bride indulged guilty passion young man loved 
though probably thought often phineas finn since marriage thoughts never nature disturb rest 
never occurred even think regarded feeling offence husband 
would hated idea presented mind 
prided pure high principled woman kept strong guard upon nearly free dangers rocks upon women made shipwreck happiness 
took pride would blame pride 
though blamed never occurred think might danger shipwreck 
put away idea love first perceived phineas regarded friendship accepted mr kennedy offer assured conviction acting best happiness concerned 
felt romance position sweet phineas stood top falls linter told hopes dared indulge 
bottom falls presumed take arms forgiven without difficulty telling would alpha omega romance life 
felt bound tell mr kennedy occurred felt could hardly angry even told 
often thought lover since love telling lover never regarding husband light thoughts frightened guilty thoughts 
come romance pleasant gone 
soon banished left sweet flavor loved taste sweetness though knew gone 
man friend especially husband friend 
care see life successful especially husband care 
great delight know husband liked man 
man would marry man wife friend 
pure pleasant 
idea flitted across brain man love one else like therefore become afraid least realize danger position 
immediate glance matter go beyond falseness men 
suspected phineas truth transferred affections violet effingham little value love man occur moment also transferred robert kennedy done worse 
remember autumn young phoebus among men turned back upon upon mountain might hide agony heart learned wife another man winter could hide fact heart elsewhere speculated counted facts satisfied phineas could even seen violet effingham since two stood together upon mountain 
false men false weak heart chiltern violet effingham said phineas walked away grosvenor place 
fair sacrificed rich winning fascinating lord brentford would receive even son sake receiving also daughter law phineas also liked lord chiltern seen fancied seen fine things looked forward regeneration hoping perhaps might hand good work 
recognize propriety sacrificing violet effingham even work good 
miss effingham refused lord chiltern twice surely ought sufficient 
occur love girl violet would great treasure 
regarded still love hopelessly love lady laura kennedy chapter xviii mr turnbull wednesday evening house seven clock phineas mr monk hall door 
first guests found mr monk alone dining room 
butler said mr monk brace decanters hands proceeded put neighborhood fire 
finished go stairs receive two great men properly

minute early 
seven seven late 
lord bless think ashamed found act decanting wine remember lord palmerston saying committee salaries five six years ago daresay english minister hall door opened maid servant 
english minister got nobody maid servant open hall door obliged look wine 
wonder whether improper like means injuring british constitution 
perhaps resign soon nobody follows example grave evil results may avoided 
sincerely hope love british constitution love also respect members english cabinet held 
turnbull moment hates rich man powdered footmen hanging house ever lord palmerston 
still business 
oh yes makes thirty thousand year 

turnbull talking maid servant 
hope opened door properly 
certainly far perceived said mr turnbull better speech joke 
respectable young woman say 
one london said mr monk finn seems think ought man livery 
matter perfect indifference said mr turnbull 
one never think things 
either said mr monk 
laird loughlinter announced went dinner 
mr turnbull good looking robust man sixty long gray hair red complexion hard eyes well cut nose full lips 
nearly six feet high stood quite upright always wore black swallow tail coat black trousers black silk waistcoat 
house least always dressed dinner tables 
difference might costume home staleybridge saw london means knowing 
nothing face indicate special talent 
one looking would take fool none fire genius eye lines mouth play thought fancy generally found faces men women made great 
mr turnbull certainly made great could hardly done without force intellect 
one popular popular politician country 
poor men believed thinking honest public friend men poor believed power thinking counsels must surely prevail 
obtained ear house favor reporters opened voice public dinner public platform without conviction words spoken would read thousands 
first necessity good speaking large audience advantage mr turnbull made sure 
yet could hardly said great orator 
gifted powerful voice strong may perhaps call broad convictions perfect self reliance almost unlimited powers endurance hot ambition keen scruples moral skin great thickness 
nothing said pained attacks wounded raillery touched least 
sore spot probably first thoughts waking every morning told least totus teres atque rotundus 
course thorough radical mr monk 
mr monk first waking thoughts probably exactly reverse friend 
mr monk much hotter man debate mr turnbull mr monk ever doubting never doubted much violent also effective debate 
mr monk jeered cabinet minister keeping attendant grander parlor maid substratum self doubt joke 
mr turnbull certainly great radical enjoyed great reputation 
think high office state ever offered things said justified seemed justify declaring possible circumstances would serve crown 
serve people said much respect servants crown think office higher 
greatly called task speech mr mildmay present premier asked whether recognize called servants crown hard worked truest servants people 
house press supported mr mildmay mr turnbull quite indifferent assertion made three four thousand persons manchester effect specially friend servant people received acclamation felt quite satisfied gained point 
progressive reform franchise manhood suffrage acknowledged far distant end equal electoral districts ballot tenant right england well ireland reduction standing army till standing army reduce utter disregard political movements europe almost idolatrous admiration political movements america free trade everything except malt absolute extinction state church among principal articles mr turnbull political catalogue 
think learned art arranging words stood upon legs mastered voice obtained ear house work life difficult 
nothing construct could always deal generalities 
free responsibility called upon either study details master even great facts 
business inveigh existing evils perhaps easier business privilege audience attained 
work cut forest trees nothing subsequent cultivation land 
mr monk told phineas finn great charms inaccuracy permitted opposition 
mr turnbull doubt enjoyed charms full though would sooner put padlock mouth month owned much 
upon whole mr turnbull doubt right resolving would take office though reticence subject might becoming 
conversation dinner though altogether political subjects nothing special interest long girl change plates gone door closed gradually opened came pleasant sparring match two great radicals radical joined governing powers radical stood aloof 
mr kennedy barely said word phineas almost silent mr kennedy 
come hear discussion quite willing listen guns great calibre fired amusement 
think mr mildmay making great step forward said mr turnbull 
think said mr monk 
believe would ever live go far 
hardly suffice even year still coming great deal 
shows far man may made go proper force applied 
matters little ministers

little indeed 
mind whether lord de terrier mr mildmay mr gresham choose get made first lord treasury 
ambition turnbull

went kind thing like go top ladder 
feel could good becoming minister could becoming first minister 
doubt fitness position doubt fitness position minister said mr turnbull 
mean grounds said mr kennedy 
mean every ground said mr turnbull rising legs standing back fire 
course fit diplomatic intercourse men would come simply desire deceiving 
course unfit deal members parliament would flock around wanted places 
course unfit answer every man question give information one 
could answer give information said mr kennedy 
mr turnbull intent speech may doubted whether heard interruption 
took notice went 
course unfit maintain proprieties seeming confidence crown powerless people powerful 
man recognizes unfitness work clearly mr monk 
took hand work like leader led 
tell us fairly convictions worth mr mildmay cabinet question man may hardly answer said mr monk 
question man least answer consents sit said mr turnbull tone voice almost angry 
reason supposing omitted duty said mr monk 
simply reconcile known opinions practices colleagues 
tell convictions may worth mr mildmay cabinet 
take upon say worth chair sit 
tell aspirations consented fill chair shall judge worth 
thought might possibly leaven batch bread bake giving whole batch flavor reform would possessed absented 
thought asked join mr mildmay mr gresham fact request indicated liberal progress refused request declining assist good work 
could supported anything proposed worthy support said mr turnbull 
yes could effective taking care measure proposed worthy support may possibly 
thought good deal believe decision right 
sure right said mr kennedy 
juster object ambition seat cabinet said phineas 
sir must dispute said mr turnbull turning round upon hero 
regard position high ministers respectable 
thank much said mr monk 
orator went regardless interruption position gentlemen inferior offices gentlemen attend rather nods winks superiors downing street interest constituents regard highly respectable 
man begin top said phineas 
friend mr monk begun pleased call top said mr turnbull 
profess think even raised going office 
independent representative really popular commercial constituency estimation highest object englishman ambition 
commercial mr turnbull said mr kennedy 
commercial constituencies really elect members accordance judgments whereas counties small towns coerced either individuals combination aristocratic influences 
yet said mr kennedy half dozen conservatives returned counties scotland 
scotland much honored said mr turnbull 
mr kennedy first take departure mr turnbull followed quickly 
phineas got go time stayed host request sat awhile smoking cigar 
turnbull wonderful man said mr monk 
domineer much fault arrogance much ignorance difference public private life 
house commons man mr turnbull position must speak dictatorial assurance 
always addressing house country large country believe unless believe 
forgets always addressing country large 
wonder sort time mrs turnbull little turnbulls phineas went home made mind mrs turnbull little turnbulls must probably bad time 
chapter xix lord chiltern rides horse bonebreaker known whatever might details mr mildmay bill ballot would form part strong party house commons numerous party desirous voting ballot made part electoral law decided independent motion brought anticipation mr mildmay bill 
arrangement probably one mr mildmay making might hampered opposition subject followers doubt motion lost 
expected debate would last one night phineas resolved would make maiden speech occasion 
strong opinions inefficacy ballot good purposes thought might able strike convictions sparks fire used plentiful old debating clubs

ordinary occasions could saunter whisper ease neighbor 
occasion went direct bench ordinarily sat began rehearse speech 
truth day spite effort made rid memory occasion 
collecting heads speech mr low talking refreshing quotations presence lord chiltern dumb bells 
taxed memory intellect various tasks feared would adjust one another 
learned headings speech one heading might follow nothing forgotten 
learned verbatim words intended utter heading hope one compact part destroyed injured compactness treachery memory course debate compact part might entirety ready use least many compact parts treachery memory accidents debate might leave speech might like vessel watertight various compartments would float buoyancy stern bow even though hold waterlogged 
use composed words even though able carry would complete work would duty answer sort gone order must able insert without prearrangement words ideas little intercalatory parts compact masses argument occupying many laborious hours 
looked round upon house perceived everything dim original awe house returned present quaking fear made feel pulsations heart became painfully aware task prepared great

debate began leisure afforded long tedious speech could served might leisure enough 
tried first follow advocate ballot might say hoping thence acquire impetus strong interest soon wearied work began long speech might ended although period martyrdom would thereby brought nearer 
half past seven many members deserted seats phineas began think might saved pains count 
reckoned members present found mystic forty first two four five seven one time eleven 
ask speaker count house wondered one else

malicious member present else known lords treasury lords admiralty would flock speaker ponderous counting thus slow length ballot lover verbosity permitted evolve without interruption 
eight clock completed catalogue illustrations immediately mr monk rose treasury bench explain grounds government must decline support motion house 
phineas aware mr monk intended speak aware also speech would short

phineas also informed mr turnbull would reply mr monk purpose crushing mr monk dust phineas prepared speech something intention subsequently crushing mr turnbull 
knew however could command opportunity 
chapter accidents must accommodate program evening 
mr monk made speech though short fiery energetic 
quick lightning words wrath scorn flew painted cowardice meanness falsehood ballot 
ballot box said grave true political opinion 
though spoke hardly ten minutes seemed say enough ten times enough slaughter argument former speaker 
every hot word fell phineas driven regret paragraph taken away choicest morsels standing ground cut feet 
mr monk sat phineas felt mr monk said phineas finn intended say 
mr turnbull rose slowly bench gangway

mr turnbull proceeded fashion crush mr monk 
prosaic clear voice language harsh unscrupulous 
mr monk joined together politics twenty years one would thought mr turnbull words bitterest enemies 
mr monk taunted office taunted desertion liberal party taunted ambition taunted lack ambition

mr turnbull still going clear loud unpleasant voice knowing long might go

expected work fall hands one would perform warmth heart could expected mr bonteen 
mr bonteen ceased two three short speeches made members fired little guns
