lastly high born lady blanche aleys fortune thrown strangely day

stared low sighing exclamation one fell upon faces rubbed brows upon ground 
lay kari addressed waving arms pointing towards time time 
afterwards learned telling god lie may soul forgiven 
end bade rise led certain wore white robes across planks ship 
hung back advanced towards bowing kissing air till drew near went upon knees laid hands upon steel clad feet 
bosom robe drew flowers placed upon knees though offering 
master whispered rise wave sword shout aloud show alive image 
sprang circling wave flame head roaring like bull bashan voice always loud carried far 
saw bright sword whirling air heard bellowings uttering cries fear poor folk fled 
indeed fell plank mud one stuck fast like drown kari rescued brethren great haste 
gone kari came said everything went well henceforward man spirit sea come earth spirit never dreamed even wizards 
thus hubert hastings become god among simple people never much heard white man seen armor sword steel 
chapter ii rocky isle another week remained upon blanche waiting till full strength returned also kari said must 
asked replied reason wished news coming spread far wide throughout land one tribe another would great swiftness flying put like bird 
meanwhile every day sat upon poop armor hour people others afar came look bringing presents quantity knew 
indeed built altar sacrificed wild creatures birds burning fire 
seen folk long way made offering 
last one night eaten kari seated together moonshine slept turned suddenly hoping thus surprise truth secret heart said plan kari know weary life 
waiting master ask question replied gentle smile 
give words spoke bad english substance 
master pleased listen told master believe gods god god brought back part world unknown master born 
believed first hour eyes opened swoon knew trees flowers smell earth saw stars heavens stood used see 
went ashore mingled natives discovered belief right since could understand something talk could understand something mine 
moreover among man came far away said seen past years wandering like one mad man seen wore image certain god neck whose name high mention 
opened robe showed wear neck fell worshipped crying man 
marvellous said

stop simple people make king give wives desires live life since return land whence came hope 
would go interrupted 
went kari try travel country 
far away 
something journey made mad comes back tells far away 
first yonder mountains must crossed till another sea reached great journey though rough 
coast sea must followed southward know far think months years journeying till length country people reached 
moreover journeying hard terrible since road runs forests deserts dwell savage tribes huge snakes wild beasts like planted flag country famine sicknesses common 
therefore counsel master leave unattempted 
thought awhile asked meant took counsel 
replied shall wait awhile till see master made king among people established rule 
shall start journey alone hoping could mad shall able mad 
thought said 
tell kari make journey perchance live reach people would welcome us know master think master would make god people country 
perhaps sacrifice god strength beauty may enter 
try kill others cling 
conquer know matters little 
go take avenged seeking vengeance die well die honor 
understand said 
kari let us start soon possible become mad staring trees flowers big eyed natives say would make king tell left country 
whether shall ever find country say 
least shall done best fail shall perish seeking way lot brave men 
master spoken said kari even quietly usual though spoke saw dark eyes flash trembling joy run body 
knowing made choice whatever happens blame 
yet master thus chosen say reach country perchance become king even shall master servant 
easy promise kari time talk reach land said laughing asked start 
replied yet awhile must make plans meantime must walk upon shore legs might grow strong 
every day walked cool morning evening going sight wreck 
went armed carrying big bow saw one since natives warned walk must looked upon 
therefore even passed one villages huts built mud thatched leaves seemed deserted 
still end bow come amiss one evening hearing little noise big tree pass reminded purring cat looked saw great beast tiger sort lying bough tree watching 
drew bow sent arrow beast piercing side side came roaring writhing biting arrow till died 
returned ship told kari happened 
said fortunate killed beast fierce kind seen would leapt passed tree 
also sent natives skin saw pierced arrow amazed thought even greater god bows feeble arrows tipped bone 
three days killing beast started journey land unknown 
long kari engaged collecting knives could find ship also arrows nails axes tools carpentering clothes know else besides goods tied bundles wrapped sailcloth bundle weighing thirty forty pounds serve presents natives trade away 
asked would carry kari answered see 
dawn following morning arrived upon shore great number men quite hundred indeed brought two litters made light wood jointed like reeds harder kari said carried 
among men parcelled loads bear upon heads said time us start litters 
started first went cabin kneeling knees thanked god brought safe far prayed st hubert protect wanderings died receive soul 
done left ship natives bowed entered litter comfortable enough grass mats lie mats curtains finely woven would turn even heaviest rain 
away went eight men bearing pole litter slung shoulders others carried bundles upon heads 
road ran forest uphill crest first hill descended litter looked back 
creek lay wreck blanche small black blot showing water beyond great sea traveled 
yonder broken hulk last link bound distant home thousands miles across ocean home heart told never see could win back land white foot ever trod deck ship blanche stood smiled talked visited together shortly marriage remembered kissed cabin 
blanche dead hand great london merchant outcast among savages country even know name everything new different 
ship rich cargo bearing us bravely weeks tempest must lie rotted sun rain never would eyes behold 
oh sense misery loneliness gripped heart done since rode away killing deleroy sword wave flame wondered born almost hoped soon might die go seek reason 
back litter crept hid face wept like child 
truly prosperous merchant london town might lived become mayor magistrate win nobility outcast adventurer humblest 
well god decreed say 
night encamped upon hilltop past rushed river vale troubled heat insects hummed bit yet accustomed ate food brought us dried flesh corn 
next morning light started mountains forests following course river shores lake 
went third evening high land saw sea beneath us different sea left seemed crossing isthmus wide skill canal might cut across joining two great seas 
real travels began staring stars brooding apart long kari turned southwards 
nothing greatly care way turned 
speak matter except say god memory remained time madness told land people lay towards south though far away 
southwards went following paths forests ocean right hand 
week wearisome marching came another tribe natives whose talk us could understand enough tell story 
indeed rumor white god appeared land sea already reached therefore prepared worship 
people left us saying dared go country 
scene departure strange since every one came rubbed forehead dust went away walking backwards bowing 
still going make great difference us since new tribe much old one though anything rather less clothed dirty 
also accepted god without question gave us food needed 
moreover left land men provided carry litters loads 
thus passing tribe tribe traveled southward ever southwards finding always rumor coming god gone us 
gentle people meet tried harm us steal goods refused us best 
adventures true many 
thus twice came tribes war tribes though appearance laid arms rate time bore litters forward 
sometimes met tribes cannibals suffered much want meat since dared touch food unless grain 
town first cannibal people moved fury killed man found murder child eat sweeping head sword 
deed expected would murder us 
shrugged shoulders saying god pleases took away slain man ate 
sometimes road ran terrible forests great trees shut light day path must hacked undergrowth 
sometimes haunted tigers tree lions spoken must watch continuously especially night keeping brutes means fires 
sometimes forced wade great rivers worse still walk swaying bridges made cables twisted reeds grew accustomed caused head swim though never permit show fear natives 
came swampy lands full snakes terrified much especially seen natives bit die within minutes 
snakes also thick man body four five paces length lived trees killed food coiling round pressing death 
snakes said would take men fashion though never saw one 
rate terrible look reminded forefather whose mouth satan talked mother eve garden eden thus brought us woe 
bank great river saw snake sight knees knocked together 
st hubert beast sixty feet length head bigness barrel skin colors rainbow 
moreover seemed hold eyes till slipped away river could move foot 
month month traveled thus covering matter perhaps five miles day since sometimes country open crossed speed 
yet although dangers many strangely enough time even heat neither us fell sick think herb kari carried bag found named coca whereof obtained went ate time time 
ever really suffer starvation since hungry took herb supported us could find food 
mercies set good offices st hubert watching heaven poor namesake godson though perhaps skill courage kari provided everything something 
length ninth month traveling kari reckoned means knots tied pieces native string long lost count time came borders great desert natives said stretched southwards hundred leagues without water 
moreover east desert rose chain mountains bordered precipices man could climb 
therefore seemed though journey must end since kari knowledge crossed went round desert madness bygone years indeed ever traveled road matter certain 
week remained among tribe lived beautiful watered valley upon borders desert wondering 
part tired traveling upon endless quest glad stay among tribe gentle friendly people like rest believed god make home till died 
kari mind set fiercely upon winning back country believed lie towards south 
day day sat regaining strength upon good food valley staring first desert south precipices left hand lastly ocean upon right 
people say drew wealth sea well land since great fishermen went upon rude boats rafts made wooden frame lashed blown skins bundles dried reeds 
upon boats frail seemed south called balsas made considerable journeys distant islands caught vast quantities fish used manure land 
moreover besides oars rigged square cotton sail upon balsas enabled run wind without labor steering craft means paddle stern 
observed springing wind north although great strength balsas came shore drawn reach waves 
inquired kari answer given fishing season since wind north would blow long time without changing went upon sea might driven southwards return 
stated indeed often happened venturesome men vanished away lost 
wish travel south way said kari 
time made answer following day asked suddenly dared attempt journey 
answered 
easy die water land weary journeying endless swamps forests crossing torrents climbing mountain ridges 
end knife nails kari purchased largest balsa people provisioning much dried fish corn water earthenware jars would carry together remaining goods wished take us 
announced god come sea desired return sea servant 
certain fine morning wind blowing steadily strongly north embarked upon balsa simple savages made obeisance wonder eyes hoisted square canvas sailed away upon suppose one maddest voyages ever made man 
although clumsy balsa moved water good rate covering quite two leagues hour say strong steady wind 
soon village left vanished mountains behind grew dim time vanished also remained nothing great wilderness upon left vast sea around 
steering clear land avoid sunken rocks sailed day night followed light came perceived running past coastline backed high mountains lay snow 
second evening mountains become tremendous saw valleys ran streams water 
thus went three days nights wind north blowing balsa taking hurt end time reckon traveled far along coast done six months journeyed land rejoiced 
kari rejoiced also said shape greatness mountains passing reminded country believed drawing near 
fourth morning however troubles began since friendly wind north grew steadily stronger till length rose gale 
soon little rag canvas torn away still rushed following seas great speed 
thought trying make land found could oars current set towards ocean impossible urge clumsy craft 
therefore must content trying keep head straight steering oar even often whirled round round 
two hours noon sky clouded burst upon us great thunder storm torrents rain also wind grew stronger stronger 
could longer steer anything except lie flat upon bottom balsa gripping cords tied together save washed overboard since often foaming crests waves broke upon us 
indeed marvellous frail craft hang together owing lightness reeds blown skins tied still floated whirling round round sped upon southward path 
yet knew could endure long committed soul god well able half drowned state wishing miseries ended 
darkness came still thunder roared lightning blazed flare caught sight snow capped mountains far away upon coast also kari clinging reeds balsa side time time kissing golden image pachacamac hung neck 
presently set lips ear shouted bold gods still us storm 
yes answered soon shall gods peace 
heard fell thinking wits left many perils passed since saw shores thames seemed sad nothing since would better die beginning end much misery 
glare lightning shone upon handle sword wave flame still strapped remembered rune written upon mother rendered upon morning fight frenchmen 
run lifts wave flame high love shall live battle die 
storm tossed er wide seas shall roam strange lands shall make home 
conquering conquered shall far away shall sleep 
fitted well though love known little unhappy battle must die one water 
also conquered nothing conquered fate 
short thing could read two ways like prophecies one line true beyond doubt namely wave flame sleep together 
awhile later lightning shone awesomely like swords whole army destroying angels sky became alive fire 
light instant saw ahead us great breakers beyond looked like dark mass land 
first hungry curling waves got hold balsa tossed dizzily flung deep valley water 
another came another till senses reeled went 
cried st hubert land saint could help cried another greater 
last vision riding huge breaker though horse 
came crash darkness 
lo seemed though one calling back depths sleep 
trouble opened eyes shut glare light 
sat gave pain felt beaten looked 
shone sun sky deepest blue sea almost calm around rocks sand among crawled great reptiles knew turtles seen many wanderings 
moreover kneeling side sword taken body deleroy still strapped kari bled wound almost white encrusted salt otherwise seemed unharmed 
stared unable open mouth amazement spoke first saying voice note triumph tell gods us faith white man look brought back land prince 
kari tone weak state angered 
scold faith address white man instead master reached country great nothing supposed answered subjects noble kari pointed crawling turtles 
rich wondrous land gold silver mud pointed barren rocks sand around 
smiled jest answered humbly nay master yonder land 
looked following glance saw many leagues way across water two snowclad peaks rising bank clouds 
know mountains went without doubt one gateways land 
might well london hope passing gate kari 
tell chanced 
think 
great wave caught us threw us right rocks shore 
look balsa pointed broken heap reeds pierced skins 
help rose went 
none could know boat 
still balsa nothing else tied tangled mass still remained things brought us black bow armor though jars broken 
borne us well never bear us said 
master 
country yonder would set fragments case gold place temple sun memorial 
went pool rainwater lay hollow rock near drank fill thirsty 
also among ruins balsa found dried fish left us washed filled 
limped crest land behind perceived little island perhaps two hundred english acres extent whereon nothing grew except coarse grass 
island however haunt great numbers seafowl nested also turtles mentioned certain beasts like seals otters 
least shall starve said though dry season may die thirst 
island remained four long months 
food ate turtles cooked fires kari made cunningly twirling pointed piece driftwood hollow another piece filled dust dried grass 
lacked knowledge must starved lived raw flesh 
plenty meat birds eggs also fish caught pools tide 
shells turtles help stones built us kind hut keep sun rain hot place sufficient shelter also stench used shells catch rainwater stored best could seasons drought 
lastly big bow saved armor shot sea otters pelts made us garments rubbing skins turtle fat handling make soft 
thus lived moon moon upon desert place till thought go mad loneliness despair help came near us 
mountains mainland far away us stretched leagues sea could swim anything make boat 
must remain die last cried wretchedness 
nay answered kari gods still us save us season 
indeed strange fashion 
chapter iii daughter moon fourth time since cast away island huge full moon shone sky wondrous blue 
kari watched rise two snow clad peaks far away called gateway land near us yet would seem distant heaven 
heaven might hope reach upon wings spirit died country could come watched great moon climb higher higher ladder little bar like clouds till wearying let eyes fall upon glittering pathway light made upon bosom placid sea

bow balsa quilla stern us others long night journey speech must content gazing shoulder beauty best could well kari ever seemed come eyes 
thus long hours went till length near land moon sank sailed twilight 
came dawn front us saw lovely strand green palms within ring snow clad mountains two great peaks seen isle 
shore city white flat roofed houses rising perchance half mile sea hill four five hundred feet height terraced 
top hill stood mighty building painted red look took one churches people center gleamed great doors found afterwards covered plates gold 
behold temple pachacamac master whispered kari bowing head kissing air token reverence 
time watchmen set search sea boat quilla noted approach

men rose humbler sort creeping balsa suddenly seized lifted shoulders light thing reeds blown skins could easily enough 
preceded chiefs advanced beach town still remaining seated boat kari crouching behind 
strange business almost laughed aloud wondering grave merchants cheap known london would think could see thus 
kari said without turning head going us set us yonder temple worshipped nothing eat think master answered kari since lady quilla could come speak would 
think take house king country understand dwelling

passing gates bearers placed balsa ground fell back 
door house appeared quilla accompanied tall stately looking man wore fine robe woman middle age also gorgeously apparelled 
lord said quilla bowing behold kinsman caraca name lesser sort king yuncas named quismancu wife mira

led large room flat roof hastily prepared hanging beautiful broideries walls sat carven stool presently quilla ladies brought food kind intoxicating drink called chicha many months water drinking found cheering pleasant taste 
food noted served platters gold silver cups also gold strangely fashioned knew come rich land 
afterwards learned however money gold silver produced used ornament decorate temples palaces incas called kings great lords 
chapter iv oracle rimac town quismancu remained seven days going abroad little people pressed stared countenance

told story rather kari told namely risen sea found hermit named zapana desert island

evening alone chamber none could hear us told kari quilla promised marriage prince would inca land 
said kari

think choose go lady quilla would come us since perhaps would like also hear oracles 
go done secret say night weary stared people 
said desired learn religion nation see new things 
perhaps ordered master 
ask matter 
seemed kari ask perhaps high priest pachacamac worshippers god brotherhood perhaps lord quismancu perhaps quilla know 
least day quismancu inquired whether would please visit temple night matter settled 
accordingly darkness fallen two litters brought entered quilla waiting woman seating one kari quismancu wife come say 
preceded another litter priest god surrounded guard soldiers rain storm borne hill little way temple 
golden doors lightning glimmered fitfully descended led white robed men bearing lanterns various courts inner sanctuary god threshold crossed loving company heathen idols 
far could see lamplight great glorious place everywhere eye fell gold places gold walls offerings gold upon floor stars gold upon roof 
strange thing holy place however seemed quite empty except aforesaid gold 
neither altar image nothing lamp lit void 
prostrated save alone prayed silence 
rose whisper asked kari god 
answered nowhere yet everywhere 
thought true saying indeed solemn place felt though surrounded divine 
priests gorgeously apparelled led us across sanctuary door opened upon stairs 
stairs went long passage seemed run beneath earth air heavy 
walked hundred paces narrow place came steps another door passing found second temple smaller visited like rich gold 
center temple sat image man rudely fashioned gold 
behold rimac speaker whispered kari 
gold speak asked 
kari made answer 
presently priests began mutter prayers incantations thought unholy laid offerings looked like raw flesh set cups gold idol thought unholier still 
lastly drew back asked would learn 
made answer like business 
kari say anything quilla spoke boldly saying would learn future would befall us 
long silence confess fear got hold seemed though spirits moving air darkness behind us yes though could hear whisperings rustle wings 
suddenly end silence golden image front us began glow though molten emerald eyes set head sparkle terribly frightened much shame sake would run away stood still prayed st hubert protect devil works 
presently prayed still harder image began speak yes horrid whistling voice spoke although one near 
words said clad silver whose skin white whose hair yellow one seen thousand years shall possess land tavantinsuyu shall steal wealth shall slay people shall cast gods 
yet yet therefore command pachacamac uttered voice rimac speaker none harm cross mighty seaborn lord since shall strong wall many sword shall red blood wicked 
whistling voice ceased priests stared seemed think words fateful 
suddenly began came sea shining one wandered ancient blood know 
know yet may say since spirit spirits whose image wears upon heart bids silent 
bold bold prosper grow great child pachacamac thy wanderings yet done 
still mountain climbed crest hangs fringe heaven gold 
voice ceased time stared kari shook head humbly though bewildered could understand 
image spoke daughter sun whose veins play moonbeams fairer evening star one think men shall desire shall flow blood great 
one whose thought swift lightning subtle snake one passion burns like fire womb mountain filled spirit dances fire longs things afar 
daughter sun whose blood run moonbeams thou shalt slip hated arms sun shall thy shelter beloved arms thou shalt sleep last 
yet vengeance god betrayed fly fast far voice ceased thought 
little space golden figure oracle glowed fiercely emerald eyes shone terribly kind scream spoke saying snows tavantinsuyu shall red blood waters rivers shall full blood 
yes ye three shall wade blood rain blood shall pluck fruit desires 
still gods tavantinsuyu shall endure kings shall reign children shall free 
end death gods death kings death people 
still yet yet none live shall see children children children 
rimac voice spoken treasure ye words interpret ye 
whistling voice died away like thin cry starving child desert great silence 
moment figure gold ceased glow eyes emerald burn leaving thing dead lump metal 
priests prostrated rising led us place without word light lamps saw faces full terror full doubted whether could feigned 
come went last found outside glittering temple doors litters awaited us 
mean whispered quilla side 
know answered hurriedly think means death 
yet ceased 
moment moon appeared behind rain clouds shone upon upturned face eyes glory 
learned afterwards words famous oracle went land caused great talk wonder mixed fear none import spoken generations 
shaped fortunes came know quismancu people determined allowed go among 
every day white god rise sea desired come bide defense boast hermit named zapana believed appeared upon desert isle 
rimac spoken changed said depart accompany quilla upon journey home father huaracha king chancas swift messenger king invited quismancu answered desired must obeyed god rimac commanded nevertheless sure meet 
thinking things wondered much whether oracle came golden rimac perchance heart quilla kari desired leave yuncas travel chancas 
know ever learn since matters gods people secret grave 
asked kari asked quilla stared innocent eyes replied inspire golden tongue rimac indeed ever learn whether rimac speaker spirit lump metal priest talked 
know one end tavantinsuyu believed spirit spoke god could understand words though christian man could credit 
came days later quilla kari certain old men took priests ambassadors departed journey 
went people wept around litter sorrow real feigned traveled litters guarded two hundred soldiers armed axes copper bows cast flowers feet bearers 
weep though kindly treated indeed worshipped glad see last city people wearied 
moreover felt midst plots though knew nothing save quilla outward eye lovely innocent maiden hand 
plots indeed came understand time nothing less preparing great war chancas yuncas wage lord inca king mighty nation quichuas home city called cuzco far inland 
indeed alliance arranged quilla quilla proposed sacrifice gift person heir throw dust eyes inca whose dominion father planned take imperial crown tavantinsuyu 
leaving coastland borne forward passes great mountains upon wonderful road finely made never seen like england 
times crossed rivers thrown bridges stone 
mayhap came swamps yet road still ran built upon deep foundations mud 
never turn aside always went conquering every hindrance one inca roads pierced tavantinsuyu end end 
came many towns land thickly populated part slept one night 
always fame gone curacas chiefs towns waited upon offerings though indeed divine 
first five days journey saw little quilla length one night forced camp kind rest house upon top high mountain pass cold deep snow lay 
place curacas trouble went alone kari elsewhere climbed certain peak far rest house thence might see sunset think quiet 
glorious scene high point 
round stood cold crests snow clad mountains towering skies lay deep valleys rivers ran like veins silver 
immense landscape seemed end grand crushed spirit arched perfect sky whose rich blue gorgeous lights evening began gather great sun sank behind snowy peaks 
far heavens floated one wide winged bird eagle mountains larger fowl ever seen red light playing turned thing fire 
watched bird wished pinions could bear far away sea 
yet wish go home left earth kind heart would welcome awhile ago answered yes anywhere loneliness sure 
least kari friend jealous one though late could see thinking things friendship dark plottings high ambitions yet said little 
strange beautiful woman quilla heart went beautiful thought times looked kindly 
avail seeing promised marriage high placed native man would king surely known enough women promised marriage men well let 
thinking thus desolation took hold sat rock covered face hands might see tears knew gathering eyes fell 
yes midst awful solitude hubert hastings whose soul filled sat like lost child wept 
presently felt touch upon shoulder let fall hands thinking kari found hear soft voice voice quilla say seems gods weep 
weep god waves named hurachi weep answered stranger strange land weep wings whereon fly away like great bird us 
looked awhile said gently whither would fly god sea back sea cease call god answered know well man though another race 
thought know 
whither would fly lord hurachi land born lady quilla land shall never see 
ah doubtless wives children heart hungry 
nay neither wife child

bowed went presently without words followed 
front palace great square open ground surrounded houses except towards east square marshalled army men splendidly arrayed carrying copper headed spears 
front pitched great pavilion made cloths various colors 
king huaracha simply dressed robe white cotton wearing little crown gold carrying large spear took seat upon throne right smaller throne sat quilla left stood yet another throne ornamented gold empty 
throne huaracha empty stood chair covered silver bidden take seat placed could see behind around lords generals 
scarcely arranged dip beyond open space appeared heralds carried spears fantastically dressed 
shouted inca upanqui child sun god ruled earth drew near 
let approach said huaracha briefly departed 
awhile later arose sound barbarous music chanting dip emerged glittering litter borne upon shoulders richly clothed men told afterwards princes blood surrounded beautiful women carried jewelled fans councillors 
litter inca upanqui marched guard picked warriors perhaps hundred 
litter set front throne gilded curtains drawn came man whose attire dazzled eyes 
seemed consist gold precious stones sewn mantle crimson wool 
wore head dress also many colors joseph coat surmounted two feathers alone might bear head dress scarlet fringe made tasselled wool hung upon forehead

old man white locks beard hung upon splendid garments supported upon royal staff headed great emerald 
fine cut face also though still kingly weak age eyes blear 
sight rose huaracha descended throne saying loud voice welcome land chancas upanqui inca quichuas 
old monarch eyed moment answered thin voice greeting huaracha curaca chancas 
huaracha bowed said thank among people title curaca king inca 
upanqui drew full height replied incas know kings throughout land tavantinsuyu save huaracha 
inca yet chancas unconquered know king 
pray seated inca 
upanqui stood still moment frowning thought make short answer suddenly glance fell upon changed current mind 
white god sea asked almost childish curiosity 
heard tell truth came look bandy words huaracha say talked spear point 
red beard coat shines 
let come worship 
come think worship 
say god inca 
well remember strange prophecies white god rise sea forefather incas 
say god shall much mischief land comes

mayhap one shall take done broke furious huaracha would quieted councillors whispering ears 
moment minister high priest larico noting passed impassive face said coldly wroth king huaracha lay much weight upon idle words glorious inca since even gods doze times weighed cares empire 
affront meant least inca one us dream would tarnish honor offering violence guests day night

therefore accept serve cause seems noble faithfully end huaracha 
stretched hand compact sealed 
next day work began 
huaracha made known captains commanding obey things looking half divine readily enough 
soldiering knew little seaman bred yet learned man english race however strange country finds make path ends

still let lie 
fell discussing terms alliance came battle help kari could bring among clung cuzco 
huaracha took another chamber debated business 
kari kari bigot said way neither ever set eyes quilla sacrilege 
say answered would best make alliance kari knew honest pretender since without help think would possible defeat armies people incas 
rest must trust chance making promises quilla 
would avail little said huaracha seeing without doubt dead vengeance remains us 
poison cuzco white lord eight days later marching cuzco great host us numbering least forty thousand chancas twenty five thousand rebellious yuncas joined standard 
marched great road mountains across plains driving us numberless herds native sheep food meeting man since soon territory chancas fled approach 
length one night camped upon hill named carmenca saw beneath us distance mighty city cuzco standing valley river ran 
huge fortresses built great blocks stone temples palaces open squares countless streets bordered low houses 
moreover beyond around saw things namely camps vast army dotted thousands white tents 
urco ready us said kari grimly pointed tents

prince appeared suspected conspiracy rumor kari lived everywhere obtained names connected spies pursued murder sudden death 
poisoned food stabbed walked streets night wives young fair vanished away believed houses desired even children kidnapped doubtless become servants knew 
complained things old inca upanqui without avail since matters powerless urco command armies 
therefore would even welcome triumph huaracha meant kari would become inca lessened territory 
parted play parts kari brought foolishness worshipped believing truth god 
told fear since would command armies huaracha battle 
surveyed ground light lasted night together huaracha kari toiled making plans great fight come 
ready lay sleep awhile wondering whether last time upon earth tell truth caring overmuch believing quilla dead sins weighed upon none might confess glad leave world troubles whatever might lie beyond even sleep 
comes time men everything desire rest hour exiled desolate 
strange country among alien people found one soul akin mine beautiful woman loved come love desire 
end owing necessities statecraft nobleness separated although would seem yet escaped defilement spirited away temple barbarous worship almost sure death found 
best blinded lay darkness man might come superstitions folk 
even kari became inca would help still live since fiercest bigot swore would kill friend rather touch vowed false gods 
perhaps priests save sorrow would kill

sacrifice little fire burned upon altar sunk low though told hundreds years never extinguished suddenly inca began speak 
many particulars heard told tale kari estrangement past years plottings mother urco dead like mother kari 
woman would appear persuaded inca kari conspiring therefore urco ordered take prisoner returned kari wife saying kari killed 
upanqui became overcome emotion aged apt beat breast even shedding tears unjustly allowed things happen wicked triumph good sin said felt sure father sun would bring punishment indeed chance sooner thought 
continued story setting urco iniquities sacrileges gods also murders people high low degree stealing wives daughters 
lastly told coming kari supposed dead story set 
finished tale much solemn ceremonial deposed urco heirship empire gave back kari belonged right birth calling upon dead forefathers one one witness act great formality bound prince fringe brow 
said words soon prince kari must change yellow circlet wear take burden empire know quickly may purpose withdraw palace yucay make peace god called hence dwell mansions sun 
finished kari homage father quiet even voice told tale wrongs suffered hands urco brother escaped living maddened hate 
told also wandered across sea though england said nothing saved misery death great person country 
still since suffered wrong kari persuaded accompany back land wisdom might shine upon darkness owing divine magical gifts hither come safety 
lastly asked assembled priests lords content accept inca stand war urco might wage 
answered content would stand 
followed many rites informing dead incas one one solemn declaration mouth high priest offering many prayers sun father 
long prayers chants choirs hidden side chapels interspersed day drew towards close done 
thus came dusk gathering inca followed kari priests congregation left temple present kari heir throne vast crowd waited upon open square outside doors 
ceremony went 
inca us space although packed closely together hastings herrings basket took stand upon platform surrounded marvellous cable made links solid gold said needed fifty men lift ground 
upanqui whose strength seemed restored perhaps drug eaten spur great event stepped forward edge low platform addressed multitude eloquent words setting matter done temple 
ended speech asking formal question children sun accept prince kari first born inca roar assent died away upanqui turned call kari might present people 
moment gathering twilight saw great fierce faced man bandaged head knew urco leap golden chain 
sprang upon platform shout accept thus pay back treachery plunged gleaming copper knife sword inca breast 
instant could stir packed crowd urco leapt back golden chain edge platform vanish amongst beneath doubtless men following disguised citizens peasants 
indeed beheld seemed frozen horror 
one great sigh went silence since deed known annals empire 
moment aged upanqui stood upon feet blood pouring white beard jewelled robe 
turned little said clear gentle voice kari inca sooner thought 
receive god father pardon murderer think true son mine 
fell forward face lifted dead 
still silence hung though tongues men smitten dumbness 
length kari stepped forward cried inca dead inca live avenge 
declare war upon urco murderer cling urco spell lifted dim hordes went yell hatred urco butcher parricide men rushed fro searching 
vain escaped darkness 
following day ceremonies though many omitted terror trouble times kari crowned inca exchanging yellow crimson fringe taking throne name upanqui father 
cuzco none say nay whole city horror struck sacrilege committed 
also clung urco fled away town named huarina borders great lake called titicaca island marvellous temples full gold town lay distance cuzco 
civil war began raged three whole months though happened time labor set little would get forward story 
war played great part 
fear kari chancas seeing inca realm thus rent two would attack cuzco 
became business prevent 
ambassador kari visited camp huaracha bearing offers peace gave could ever hope win strength arms 
found old warrior king still sick wasted hurt urco club though could walk upon crutches set case 
answered wish fight kari offered honorable terms especially waging war urco huaracha hated striven poison daughter dealt blow sure would end death 
therefore ready make firm peace new inca addition offered would surrender quilla heiress would queen chancas 
words went back kari find matter hard rock mountains 
vain plead vain high priest larico subtle hints arguments strive gentle mind 
brother said kari soft even voice heard patiently end forgive tell advancing prayer one word say behalf king huaracha say two unhappily bewitched desire virgin sun lady quilla wife 
brother take everything else give leave lady alone 
handed huaracha told bring upon upon people curse father sun pachacamac spirit sun 
upanqui father according flesh dared look upon entered house sun learned bloody cruel death came upon magicians wise men assured oracles declare 
therefore rather crime crimes would choose huaracha renew war us join even urco strive tear throne even slain die honor 
could never answered sadly 
brother hubert called english name could never know well 
like rest us must bear burden 
mayhap may please gods gods end way foresee give woman seek 
free never give 
deed would though land england king commanded consecrated bread cups wine snatched hands priests temples cast dogs given cheer infidels within gates dragged away nuns convents become lemans 
would think king country added meaning would thought stolen one nuns beautiful desired wife although kari words stung truth answered matter wore another face 
also quilla become virgin sun free escape urco 
yes brother answered believe religion idolatry understand sun symbol garment god inca blood us inner knowledge talk father mean children god though common people taught otherwise 
rest lady took vows free secret reasons know nothing know offered marriage urco found upon island 
grieve also yet would remember priests teach every life brutal must loss sorrow sacrifice since steps man climb towards things spirit 
pluck flowers garden fate gives leave one white bloom alone 
words preached till length could bear said roughly evil thing inca separate love one pleasing heaven 
therefore great friend mine tell face take lady quilla golden grave shall 
know brother answered therefore incas cause holy spouse travel quickly skies nature take 
know also destiny things destiny decrees happen unhelped man 
still tell thwart succeed ends kill lady also committed sacrilege 
yes although love better man kill 
king huaracha able snatch away force make war either people people destroyed 
let us talk matter rather plans urco since least woman concerned know faithful sorely need help 
heavy heart went back camp huaracha told kari words 
wroth heard since gods different incas thought nothing holiness virgins sun talked renewing war

also told much desired quilla could fight upon side since sworn aid kari urco word might broken 
moreover yuncas allies wearying long absence home satisfied gentle forgiveness redress grievances new inca promised gone departed long march coast many chancas slipping back country 
therefore huaracha hour passed 
length agreed would foolish attack cuzco order try rescue quilla since even huaracha face desperate defense probably would find daughter dead vanished away unknown distant convent 
could trust fortune deliver hands 
agreed obtained honorable peace else desired would well huaracha return land leaving body five thousand picked men willing serve assist war urco guard quilla perchance could deliver house sun
