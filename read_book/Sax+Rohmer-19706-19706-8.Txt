egyptologists think egypt little nothing teach pyramid yd lost interest directly learned apparently contained treasure 
little know really contained sime mariette suspect sir gaston maspero suspect late sir michael ferrara camped pyramid yd camped made discovery well said sime growing interest 
point upon lips sealed believe black magic altogether sure well entitled opinion

even assuming entrance doubt escape means would impossible 
one could climb face pyramid one ever succeeded climbing
