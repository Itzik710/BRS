fortune rougons chapter quitting plassans rome gate southern side town find right side road nice little way past first suburban houses plot land locally known aire saint mittre 
aire saint mittre oblong shape level footpath adjacent road separated strip trodden grass 
narrow blind alley fringed row hovels borders right left end closed bits wall overgrown moss seen top branches mulberry trees jas meiffren extensive property entrance lower road 
enclosed upon three sides aire saint mittre leads nowhere crossed people stroll 
former times cemetery patronage saint mittre greatly honored provencal saint old people plassans could still remember seen wall cemetery standing although place closed years 
soil glutted corpses found necessary open new burial ground end town 
old abandoned cemetery gradually purified dark thick set vegetation sprouted every spring 
rich soil gravediggers could longer delve without turning human remains possessed wondrous fertility 
tall weeds overtopped walls may rains june sunshine visible high road inside place presented appearance deep dark green sea studded large blossoms singular brilliancy 
beneath one feet amidst close set stalks one could feel damp soil reeked bubbled sap 
among curiosities place time large pear trees twisted knotty boughs none housewives plassans cared pluck large fruit grew upon 
indeed townspeople spoke fruit grimaces disgust 
delicacy however restrained suburban urchins assembled bands twilight climbed walls steal pears even ripe 
trees weeds vigorous growth rapidly assimilated decomposing matter old cemetery saint mittre malaria rising human remains interred greedily absorbed flowers fruit eventually odour one could detect passing strong perfume wild gillyflowers 
merely question summers 
last townspeople determined utilise common property long served purpose 
walls bordering roadway blind alley pulled weeds pear trees uprooted sepulchral remains removed ground dug deep bones earth willing surrender heaped corner 
nearly month youngsters lamented loss pear trees played bowls skulls one night practical jokers even suspended femurs tibias bell handles town 
scandal still remembered plassans cease authorities decided bones shot hole dug purpose new cemetery 
work however usually carried discreet dilatoriness country towns entire week inhabitants saw solitary cart removing human remains mere rubbish 
vehicle cross plassans end end owing bad condition roads fragments bones handfuls rich mould scattered every jolt 
briefest religious ceremony nothing slow brutish cartage 
never town felt disgusted 
several years old cemetery remained object terror 
although adjoined main thoroughfare open comers left quite deserted prey fresh vegetable growth 
local authorities doubtless counted selling seeing houses built upon evidently unable find purchaser 
recollection heaps bones cart persistently jolting streets may made people recoil spot perhaps indifference shown due indolence repugnance pulling setting characteristic country people 
events authorities still retained possession ground last forgot desire dispose 
even erect fence round left open comers 
time rolled people gradually grew accustomed barren spot would sit grass edges walk gather groups 
grass worn away trodden soil become gray hard old cemetery resembled badly levelled public square 
effectually efface memory objectionable associations inhabitants slowly changed appellation place retaining name saint likewise applied blind alley dipping one corner field 
thus aire saint mittre impasse saint mittre 
dates however considerable time back 
thirty years aire saint mittre presented different appearance 
one day townspeople far inert indifferent derive advantage let trifling consideration suburban wheelwrights turned wood yard 
present day still littered huge pieces timber thirty forty feet long lying piles looking like lofty overturned columns 
piles timber disposed intervals one end yard continual source delight local urchins

sometimes dozen sit closely packed one thin end pole raised feet ground see saw hours together 
aire saint mittre thus serves recreation ground quarter century little suburban ragamuffins habit wearing seats breeches 
strangeness place increased circumstance wandering gipsies sort traditional custom always select vacant portions encampments 
whenever caravan arrives plassans takes quarters aire saint mittre 
place consequently never empty 
always strange band troop wild men withered women among groups healthy looking children roll grass 
people live open air regardless everybody setting pots boiling eating nameless things freely displaying tattered garments sleeping fighting kissing reeking mingled filth misery 
field formerly still deserted save buzzing hornets around rich blossoms heavy sunshine thus become rowdy spot resounding noisy quarrels gipsies shrill cries urchins suburb 
one corner primitive saw mill cutting timber noise serves dull continuous bass accompaniment sharp voices

wood saw stacked plank plank along wall end carefully arranged piles six eight feet high often remain several seasons constitute one charms aire saint mittre 
stacks mysterious retired little alleys leading broader path timber wall deserted strip verdure whence small patches sky seen 
vigorous vegetation quivering deathlike stillness old cemetery still reign path 
country round plassans spot instinct languor solitude love 
delightful place love making 
cemetery cleared bones must heaped corner even day frequently happens one foot comes across fragment skull lying concealed damp turf 
nobody however thinks bodies slept turf 
daytime children go behind piles wood playing hide seek 
green path remains virginal unknown others see nought wood yard crowded timber gray dust 
morning afternoon sun warm whole place swarms life 
turmoil ragamuffins playing among timber gipsies kindling fires cauldrons sharp silhouette sawyer mounted beam stands sky moving fro precision clockwork regulate busy activity sprung spot set apart eternal slumber 
old people sit planks basking setting sun speak occasionally among bones saw carted streets plassans legendary tumbrel 
night falls aire saint mittre loses animation looks like great black hole

place becomes quite sinister particularly winter time 
one sunday evening seven clock young man stepped lightly impasse saint mittre closely skirting walls took way among timber wood yard

frigid silence wintry moon motionless recumbent poles stiffened sleep cold recalled corpses old cemetery 
young man cast rapid glance round empty space creature sound danger seen heard 
black patches end caused anxiety brief examination plucked courage hurriedly crossed wood yard 
soon felt cover slackened pace 
green pathway skirting wall behind piles planks 
footsteps became inaudible frozen grass scarcely crackled tread

young man still gazing anxiously direction suddenly one town clocks slowly solemnly struck seven 
counted strokes jumped apparently surprised relieved

strong sturdy looking lad fine mouth soft delicate skin bespoke youthfulness 
looked seventeen years age handsome characteristic way 
thin long face looked like work master sculptor high forehead overhanging brows aquiline nose broad flat chin protruding cheek bones gave singularly bold relief countenance 
face would advancing age become bony fleshless knight errant 
stage youth chin cheek lightly covered soft latent harshness attenuated charming softness certain contors remained vague childlike 
soft black eyes still full youth also lent delicacy otherwise vigorous countenance 
young fellow would probably fascinated women one calls handsome man features whole expressed ardent sympathetic life enthusiasm energy doubtless engaged thoughts girls part sunburnt girls south passed doors sultry july evenings 
remained seated upon tombstone wrapped thought apparently quite unconscious moonlight fell upon chest legs 
middle stature rather thick set developed arms labourer hands already hardened toil feet shod heavy laced boots looked large square toed 
general appearance particularly heaviness limbs bespoke lowly origin 
however something upright bearing neck thoughtful gleams eyes seemed indicate inner revolt brutifying manual labor beginning bend ground 
doubt intelligent nature buried beneath oppressive burden race class one delicate refined minds embedded rough envelope vain struggle free 
thus spite vigor seemed timid restless feeling kind unconscious shame imperfection 
honest lad doubtless whose ignorance generated enthusiasm whose manly heart impelled childish intellect could show alike submissiveness woman courage hero 
evening question dressed coat trousers greenish corduroy 
soft felt hat placed lightly back head cast streak shadow brow 
neighbouring clock struck half hour suddenly started reverie 
perceiving white moonlight shining full upon gazed anxiously ahead 
abruptly dived back shade unable recover thread thoughts

spoke word brothers youthful emphasis 
contest becoming inevitable added rate right side shall triumph 
miette listened silvere eyes meantime gazing front without observing anything 
tis well said finished speaking 
fresh pause continued warned yet still hoped however decided 
neither knew else say 
green path deserted corner wood yard relapsed melancholy stillness moon chased shadows piles timber grass 
two young people tombstone remained silent motionless pale light 
silvere passed arm round miette waist leaning shoulder 
exchanged kisses naught embrace love showed innocent tenderness fraternal affection 
miette enveloped long brown hooded cloak reaching feet leaving head hands visible 
women lower classes provence peasantry workpeople still wear ample cloaks called pelisses fashion must lasted ages 
miette thrown back hood arriving 
living open air born hotblooded race never wore cap 
bare head showed bold relief wall moonlight whitened 
still child doubt child ripening womanhood 
reached adorable uncertain hour frolicsome girl changes young woman 
stage life bud like delicacy hesitancy contor exquisitely charming distinguishes young girls 
outlines womanhood appear amidst girlhood innocent slimness woman shoots forth first embarrassment still retaining much child ever unconsciously betraying sex 
period unpropitious girls suddenly shoot become ugly sallow frail like plants due season 
however like miette healthy live open air time delightful gracefulness passed never recalled 
miette thirteen years age although strong sturdy look older bright childish smile lit countenance 
however nearly tall silvere plump full life 
like lover common beauty 
would considered ugly might appeared peculiar many young exquisites 
rich black hair rose roughly erect forehead streamed back like rushing wave flowed head neck like inky sea tossing bubbling capriciously 
thick inconvenient arrange 
however twisted tightly possible coils thick child fist wound together back head 
little time devote toilette huge chignon hastily contrived without aid mirror often instinct vigorous grace 
seeing thus naturally helmeted mass frizzy hair hung neck temples like mane one could readily understand always went bareheaded heedless alike rain frost 
dark locks appeared low forehead curved golden like crescent moon 
large prominent eyes short tip tilted nose dilated nostrils thick ruddy lips regarded apart one another would looked ugly viewed however together amidst delightful roundness vivacious mobility countenance formed ensemble strange surprising beauty 
miette laughed throwing back head gently resting right shoulder resembled old time bacchante throat distending sonorous gaiety cheeks round like child teeth large white twists woolly hair tossed every outburst merriment waving like crown vine leaves 
realize child thirteen one notice innocence underlying full womanly laughter especially child like delicacy chin soft transparency temples 
certain lights miette sun tanned face showed yellow like amber 
little soft black already shaded upper lip 
toil beginning disfigure small hands left idle would become charmingly plump delicate 
miette silvere long remained silent 
reading anxious thoughts pondered upon unknown terrors morrow tightened mutual embrace 
hearts communed understood useless cruel would verbal plaint 
girl however could last longer contain choking emotion gave expression one phrase mutual misgivings 
come back whispered hung silvere neck 
silvere made reply half stifling fearing lest give way tears like kissed brotherly fashion cheek loss consolation 
disengaging lapsed silence 
moment miette shuddered 
longer leaned silvere shoulder becoming icy cold 
yet would shuddered thus deserted path previous evening seated tombstone several seasons tasted much happiness 
cold said pulled hood head

yet nine clock take stroll along road 
miette reflected long time would probably pleasure another meeting another evening chats joy served sustain day long 
yes let us walk little eagerly replied 
let us go far mill

rose tombstone soon hidden shadow pile planks 
miette opened cloak quilted lining red twill threw half silvere shoulders thus enveloping stood close beside 
garment cloaked passed arms round waist became one 
thus shrouded pelisse walked slowly towards high road fearlessly crossing vacant parts wood yard looked white moonlight 
miette thrown cloak silvere submitted quite naturally though indeed garment rendered similar service every evening 
road nice either side suburban houses built year lined ancient elm trees grand gigantic ruins still full vigor fastidious town council replaced years since little plane trees 
silvere miette found elms huge boughs cast shadows moonlit footpath met black forms silently skirted house fronts 
amorous couples closely wrapped one cloak strolling darkness 
style promenading instituted young lovers southern towns 
boys girls among people mean marry sooner later dislike kiss two advance know spot kiss ease without exposing recognition gossip 
accordingly strolling suburbs plots waste land footpaths high road fact places passers numerous shady nooks conceal identity wrapping long cloaks capacious enough cover whole family 
parents tolerate proceedings however stiff may provincial propriety apprehensions seemingly entertained 
hand nothing could charming lovers rambles appeal keenly southerner fanciful imagination 
veritable masquerade fertile innocent enjoyments within reach humble 
girl clasps sweetheart bosom enveloping warm cloak doubt delightful able kiss one sweetheart within shrouding folds without danger recognized 
one couple exactly like another 
belated pedestrian sees vague groups gliding hither thither tis merely love passing love guessed scarce espied 
lovers know safely concealed within cloaks converse undertones make quite home frequently converse walk along random silence content embrace 
climate alone blame first instance prompted young lovers retire secluded spots suburbs 
fine summer nights one walk round plassans without coming across hooded couple every patch shadow falling house walls 
certain places aire saint mittre instance full dark dominoes brushing past one another gliding softly warm nocturnal air 
one might imagine guests invited mysterious ball given stars lowly lovers 
weather warm girls wear cloaks simply turn skirts 
winter passionate lovers make light frosts 
thus miette silvere descended nice road thought little chill december night 
passed slumbering suburb without exchanging word enjoying mute delight warm embrace 
hearts heavy joy felt side side tinged painful emotion comes thought approaching severance seemed could never exhaust mingled sweetness bitterness silence slowly lulled steps 
houses soon grew fewer reached end faubourg

events proved falsity accusation 
year went adelaide son 
faubourg annoyed could admit wrong determined penetrate supposed mystery accordingly gossips kept watch upon rougons 
soon found ample matter tittle tattle 
rougon died almost suddenly fifteen months marriage sunstroke received one afternoon weeding bed carrots

every respect first born 
would sometimes go holding pierre one hand antoine never noticing differently two little fellows already regarded 
strange home 
nearly twenty years everyone lived fancy children like mother 
everything went free control 
growing womanhood adelaide retained strangeness taken shyness fifteen 
insane people faubourg asserted lack equilibrium nerves blood disorder brain heart made lead life ordinary different rest world 
certainly natural consistent eyes neighbors consistency became pure insanity 
seemed desirous making conspicuous thought wickedly determined turn things home bad worse whereas great naivete simply acted according impulses nature 
ever since giving birth first child subject nervous fits brought terrible convulsions 
fits recurred periodically every two three months 
doctors consulted declared could nothing age would weaken severity attacks 
simply prescribed dietary regimen underdone meat quinine wine 
however repeated shocks led cerebral disorder 
lived day day like child like fawning animal yielding instincts 
macquart rounds passed time lazy pensive idleness

people least study appearances tolerant women would say 
adelaide understand meant studying appearances 
happy proud door assisted macquart knock stones wall even mixed mortar work might proceed quicker came childish delight inspect work daylight morrow act deemed climax shamelessness three gossips observed contemplating masonry

nobody ever knew life lovers led two three days spent distant intervals 
used shut little dwelling seemed uninhabited 
gossips declared macquart simply seduced adelaide order spend money astonished time see still lead wonted life ever hill dale badly equipped previously 
perhaps young woman loved seeing rare intervals perhaps disregarded entreaties feeling irresistible desire life adventure 
gossips invented thousand fables without succeeding giving reasonable explanation connection originated continued strange manner 
hovel impasse saint mittre remained closed preserved secrets 
merely guessed macquart probably acquired habit beating adelaide although sound quarrel never issued house 
however several occasions seen face black blue hair torn away

mother absent days together would make uproar hit upon diabolical devices annoying people neighbors threaten whipping 
moreover adelaide inspire much fear less obnoxious people home made victim shirking school five six times week everything could receive punishment would allow squall hearts content 
never beat even lost temper lived well placidly indolently state mental abstraction amidst uproar

moreover brother actually playing gentleman money stolen 
whenever macquart touched upon subject became fiercely enraged clamoured hours together incessantly repeating old accusations never wearying exclaiming brother ought moneyed man present time anyone asked brother ought would reply galleys formidable voice 
hatred increased rougons gathered conservatives round thus acquired certain influence plassans 
famous yellow drawing room became hare brained chatter cafe cave bandits assembly villains every evening swore daggers would murder people

tactics thus tended rouse poor people repetition absurdly ridiculous tales often came believe 
personal animosity desire revenge ill concealed beneath professions patriotism heard frequently loud voice one would dared doubt genuineness convictions 
bottom members family brutish passions 
felicite clearly understood macquart wild theories simply fruit restrained rage embittered envy would much liked purchase silence 
unfortunately short money dare interest dangerous game husband playing 
antoine injured much among well people new town 
sufficed relation 
granoux roudier often scornfully reproached man family

antoine knew consternation demeanor must cause rougons solely purpose exhausting patience day day affected fiercer opinions
