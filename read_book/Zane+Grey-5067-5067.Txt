air biting cold yet stimulated shefford stung 
horse drank rather slowly disgustedly 
shefford mounted reluctantly turned back upon trading post 
rode away pool saw large flock sheep approaching 
closely even densely packed solid slow moving mass coming precision almost like march

incidents new pleasing shefford 
ignorant life wilderness received subtle intimations might learn open less weighted heart faced gateway huge yellow bluffs left slow rise ground black mesa right 
looked back time see trading post bleak lonely bare slope pass sight behind bluffs 
shefford felt fear really little experience physical fear certain gritted teeth welcomed whatever come 
lived narrow insulated life mind spiritual things family congregation friends except one new friend whose story enthralled people quiet religious habit man deep never chance 
breathed hard tried imagine world opening almost dared glad doubt sent adrift 
tracks indian girl pony plain sand

trotted horse made good time stretch 
day contrasted greatly yet experienced 
gray clouds obscured walls rock miles west shefford saw squalls snow like huge veils dropping spreading 
wind cut keenness knife

squall swooped roared upon wind bore driving white pellets snow almost like hail freezing bitter cold former wind seemed warm comparison 
squall passed swiftly come left shefford benumbed could hold bridle 
tumbled horse walked 
sun came soon warmed melted thin layer snow sand 
still trail indian girl tracks could see 
morning gradually climbed limited view last mounted point country lay open sight sides except endless black mesa ranged north 
rugged yellow peak dominated landscape fore far away 
red jagged country extended westward huge flat topped wall gray rock 
lowering swift clouds swept across sky like drooping mantles darkened sun 
shefford built little fire dead greasewood sticks blanket round shoulders hung blaze scorching clothes hands 
cold life never appreciated fire 
desert blast pierced 
squall enveloped thicker colder windier better fortified suffer much 
howled away hiding mesa leaving white desert behind 
shefford walked leading horse exercise sun warmed 
last squall rendered indian girl trail difficult follow 
snow quickly melt besides sheep tracks tracks horses gave trouble last compelled admit could follow longer 
faint path trail led north however following soon forgot girl 
every surmounted ridge held surprise 
desert seemed never change vast whole encompassed yet near always changing 
red lake seen peaked walled canyoned country rough stormy sea rode country sharp broken features held distance 
glad get sand 
long narrow flats gray grass dotted patches greasewood lined low bare ridges yellow rock stretched away leading toward yellow peak seemed never gained upon 
shefford pictures mind pictures stone walls wild valleys domed buttes painted colorful vivid words friend venters 
believed would recognize distinctive remarkable landmarks venters portrayed certain yet come upon one 
second lonely day travel grown susceptible influence horizon different prominent points 
attributed gradual change feelings loneliness increasing wildness 
tuba flagstaff met indians occasional prospector teamster

saw many sheep trails horse tracks vicinity mountain sure espied indian watching bold ridge top 
day bright warm air clear magnified objects knew far away 
ascent gradual many narrow flats connected steps grass grew thicker longer 
noon shefford halted first cedar tree lonely dwarfed shrub seemed hard life

view became restricted lost sense slow gradual uplift rock increase scale proportion 
half way ascent compelled rest sun slanting low entered cedar forest

felt alarm 
presently heard sound 
recognized crack unshod hoofs upon rock 
horse coming trail 
shefford rather resented interruption though still alarm 
believed perfectly safe

kayenta stamping horses awoke shefford 
saw towering crag rosy morning light like huge red spear splitting clear blue sky

moreover led gang rods farther slope would worse make mistake would facing double peril 
fearless horsemen indians shadd mounted three others gang 
evidently white men outlaws ones foot

fugitives listening 
every bend canyon turns numerous might hold rapid 
shefford strained ears 
imagined low dull strange rumble 
ears yet growing sensation silence 
shore dead place muttered lassiter 
slowed bigger plunge replied joe 
listen hear true sound joe imagined expected hated dreaded hear 
mile mile drifted silent gloom vast magnificent walls 
speed turmoil whirling shrieking thundering never ceasing sound change motion rapids slow quiet drifting utter absolute silence eddying stretches still water worked strangely upon shefford mind feared going mad 
change silence help slow drift lessening strain 
hours day passed moments sun crossed blue gap golden lights hung upper walls gloom returned still dead vast insupportable silence 
came bends current quickened ripples widened long lanes little waves roughened surface made sound 
fugitives turned v shaped vent canyon 
ponderous walls sheered away river 
space sunshine far beyond league wide open rose vermilion colored cliffs 
mile river disappeared dark boxlike passage came rumble made shefford flesh creep 
mormon flung high arms let stentorian yell rolled fugitives waited mouth nonnezoshe boco 
wilder exultant note 
strange shifted gaze fay larkin girl get look called 
ferry ferry bent brawny back steering oar clumsy craft slowly turned toward left hand shore long low bank green willows cottonwoods gave welcome relief eyes 
upon opposite side river shefford saw boat similar one moored bank 
shore losin eyes seen injun red blanket said lassiter 
yes lassiter cried shefford 
look fay look jane see indians hogans mustangs green bank boat glided slowly shoreward 
deep hungry terrible rumble remorseless river became something dread
