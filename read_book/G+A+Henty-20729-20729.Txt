preface 
story war power great mahratta confederacy broken one stirring pages campaigns begun clive ended firm establishment great empire indian peninsula 
struggle began mahrattas masters small portion india territory comprising whole country bombay delhi stretching rajputana allahabad south lords district cuttack thereby separating madras calcutta 
jealousies great mahratta leaders holkar scindia constantly war peishwa poona greatly facilitated operations enabled us although cost much blood free large portion india race scourge faithless intriguing crafty cruel reckless life 
mahrattas conquering race yet failed one virtue courage 
could sweep land hordes wild horsemen could harry peaceful districts tyrannize towns conquered unable make effective stand british bayonets british sabres 
race freebooters even sentimental humanitarian feel regret overthrow power possessed single claim admiration weighed like incubus upon peoples oppressed 
history mahrattas written grant duff whose account throughout followed one long record perfidy murder crime sorts 
chapter faithful nurse 
swell ground wild country extending bombay foot ghauts stood small camp 
center large pavilion residence time major lindsay officer whose charge keep peace district 
easy matter 
inhabitants wild lawless lived small villages scattered rough country part covered forest subject depredations robber bands strongholds among hills 
major lindsay party twenty troopers defense little fear attack natives concan add authority aid collection small tax paid community deter mountain robbers descending plain 
generally spent cool season going rounds hot weather headquarters bombay 
wife infant child 
child three months old looked ayah major lindsay service ten years three elder children born however dying effects climate reaching age five 
ayah nursed succession become greatly attached family especially youngest charge 
come speak english well child always talked native tongue major saw advantage would prove boy grew able speak fluently one least native languages 
nurse mahratta 
service british resident poona recalled entered major lindsay time captain acted secretary resident 
young officer bombay ridden spend day two major sitting entrance tent 
news army said unsatisfactory 
know astonishment everyone colonel egerton appointed command spite fact infirm altogether unfit active service mostyn late resident poona carnac accompanied deputies council 
altogether bad arrangement major said 
always great disadvantage general accompanied civilians power thwart combinations 
mostyn appointment one could raise objection years poona understands mahrattas indeed much liked negotiations would far chance success stranger carnac hot headed obstinate high idea importance certain difficulties egerton 
sorry say major anticipations speedily verified 
know advance party landed aptee november rd seized roads gorge th main body disembarked panwell 
sooner got quarrel egerton carnac 
unfortunately mostyn would acted mediator taken ill day landing obliged return bombay hear hardly chance recovery 
army reach top ghauts till rd december instead latest three days landing actually spent eleven days arrived karlee eight miles advance bhore ghauts 
course encouraged enemy gave plenty time assemble make arrangements last heard harassing march 
past two days news arrived seems little doubt mahrattas closed round rear cut communications 
monstrous march slowly 
whole thing hideous blunder idea encumbering force four thousand men something like thirty thousand camp followers train less nineteen thousand bullocks say nothing draught animals preposterous thing ever heard 
fact whole thing grossly mismanaged 
say conduct mahrattas time doubtful threatening 
well known governor general council calcutta strongly disapproved whole conduct council bombay 
indeed explanation ever given took cause rugoba scoundrel grasped crown privy instigate murder nephew young peishwa 
unopposed nana furnuwees hurry punt two leading mahratta ministers formed regency gunga bye widow murdered peishwa 
matters undecided bombay council opened communications rugoba thought likely successful promised assist would advance considerable sum money cede company salsette small islands contiguous bombay bassein captured portuguese mahrattas altogether inexcusable arrangement mahrattas peace us rugoba position hand islands 
matter however settled sending expedition captured salsette tannah four years ago 
since rugoba become fugitive without shadow reason making war whole force mahratta confederacy although divided amongst frequently engaged struggles supremacy united us say scindia holkar hurry punt command army 
send four thousand men less six hundred europeans whole mahratta power desperate step 
know fought greater odds many times history india forces always well led marched smallest amount baggage possible made inferiority numbers speed activity dash 
contrary force hampered unheard degree baggage camp followers invalid head controlled two civilians moving rate testifies divided councils utter incompetency part commander 
almost impossible even hope success conditions 
lookout certainly bad younger officer agreed 
however fighting powers british soldier made blunders commanders may hope case 
disaster happen major said shall mahrattas gates bombay soon hear rumor news travels wonderfully fast among natives shall return city 
oh think need fear anything sort major besides direct line ghauts city 
even find push say force would able secure retreat 
mahratta horse never able break squares course case abandon baggage baggage animals 
agree mahrattas would doubtless hang skirts force follow bhore ghaut would come anywhere near us might detach flying parties burn plunder custom 
brave mahrattas fight love fighting simply hope plunder enlarging territories 
well may hope day two hear battle fought victory 
one victory would settle matter mahratta force consists almost entirely cavalry handful would beaten simply ride ready fight another day 
pushed occupied poona directly landed easy enough baggage train left behind forty miles panwell mahratta capital position would altogether different 
mahrattas would time collect forces probably met opposition poona could held whole mahratta force 
besides certain chiefs seeing rugoba likely made peishwa would come conclusion would best side 
course baggage left panwell case force could entered poona three days landing instead delaying th november today th january even present rate advance may another fortnight arrive poona 
think disgraceful business since first put foot india 
rate shall send mary child bombay tomorrow 
well everything peaceable although think actual risk well turbulent times like nothing force incompetent leading us powerful active enemy safe bombay 
daybreak next morning sudden shout one sentries first time posted round camp 
warning followed fierce rush large body horse foot charged camp

willing enough stay week month different thing becoming inmate house 
wait till tomorrow made long two days journey top ghauts accustomed walking feet sore 
morning go see brother 
much know alive 
feel sure take willingly two years older always kind 
accordingly next morning retraced steps difficulty finding farm ramdass 
choosing time would likely dinner soyera walked door house standing open 
stood hesitating ramdass came 
man forty years age pleasant kindly face 
looked enquiringly 
know ramdass asked 
tis soyera exclaimed 
come back years thirteen since went away welcome back little sister raised voice called anundee young woman two three twenty years age came door 
wife said sister soyera often heard speak 
soyera wife 
married six years come let us talk things 
come home good hope said 
married come alone child suppose misfortune lose husband yes alone world came hither knowing whether alive dead feeling sure welcome found 
mistaken said heartily 
anundee sure join welcome willingly give sister child place home assuredly 
pleasant fields one talk perhaps help house 
soyera saw speaking sincerely

accustomed work take much hands look two children two boys three four years old standing staring newcomer 
pleasant soyera indeed sometimes hinder much work 
accustomed children anundee years nurse english children know ways 
well let us dinner ramdass broke 
hungry want 
much fields 
woman took pot embers wood fire poured contents dish 
meal consisted species pulse boiled ghee peppers condiments added 
like among english soyera liked well woman said 
kind considerate nurses although get angry gorrawallah men neglect duty punish mahratta master would 
double faced say thing mean word always trusted 
people doubt anxious extend dominion wish personal gain 
like princes go war gain territory revenue 
reasonable wish increase lands almost shut bombay salsette islands occupied us may day enemies 
brother laughed 
seems soyera come prefer english people countrymen 
say ramdass 
asked liked told 
know tax collectors grind people scindia holkar peishwa always fighting 
know bombay meanest man could put death unless fairly tried among mahrattas men executed merest excuse executed murdered true enough ramdass said none three princes would hesitate put death anyone stood way seems strange even brahmins would take life even troublesome insect yet support men killed scores people 
use grumbling thing always suppose always 
deccan nizam dominions mysore far know oude delhi 
seems natural us powerful oppress weak one prince go war another hardly give matter thought though say english bombay may rule wisely dislike taking life princes making war us 
true heard english sahibs speaking together everything prince favourable rule poonah holkar scindia become powerful place one people seat peishwa next step might great mahratta force would descend ghauts capture bombay slay every white man 
mere handful ramdass said 
think invading nation like know least believe scindia holkar peishwa jealous never act together 
see done round madras bengal battles great princes lastly mistress told although many home could chose send twenty soldiers every one 
besides alone fight 
natives enlist aid conquests shows least well treated confidence good faith english 
well soyera talk way would willingly believe stars fall sky englishmen simply live bombay suffer ever conquer mahrattas subdued portions india everyone knows people warlike always conquered without difficulty 
look power delhi emperor puppet hands districts plain great river

harry lindsay acquired quite reputation jooneer surrounding country shikaree spoke freely bravery intelligence skill arms 
width shoulders strength muscles caused regarded prodigy generally considered grew would become great fighter attain wide renown leader bands service holkar peishwa 
sixteen sufder watched progress great approval said scarce man years yet puntojee strong skilful weapons far man many ten years older 
time see something war 
since death scindia months back succession nephew doulut age things become even unsettled 
scindia great man although times worsted rivals always managed repair fortunes add power whether young scindia keep wide territory uncle doubtful 
holkar although times scindia united english marched poona rival enemy 
peishwa sometimes alliance one great princes sometimes 
minister nana furnuwees man commanding talent 
probable scindia holkar would long since become altogether independent always contrived play one securing services secondary chiefs rajah nagpore rajah kolapoore hold balance power old man death saying things go 
matters complicated fact scindia service sixteen battalions drilled infantry commanded french officers proved valuable various sieges undertaken holkar obliged imitate example 
many think introduction infantry end prove disastrous power mahrattas whose strength hitherto lain cavalry could perform long journeys strike blow match infantry indian princes 
infantry altered marches must longer faster journey 
order battles changed altogether shall depend upon foot horse almost invincible become secondary importance 
however question present 
first thing considered three great leaders attach 
know many years scindia service death position changed 
scindia knew active capable lived soon gained much promotion 
however chief minister took dislike felt maharajah gone doulut would easily swayed counsels around instead promotion likely lose command perhaps put way

puntojee said sounds like madness 
young secured powerful protectors peishwa may hope reach high office state grow older 
know though went speaking rather lad high office thing desired 
means mixed intrigues kinds object jealousy hatred running terrible risk ruin every change government 
turned harry 
thinking speak frankly highness 
mahratta everyone else suppose 
son english parents 
went give account killing father mother saved soyera brought son times might advantage go bombay 
nana listened great interest 
strange tale said harry brought story conclusion explains things times surprised 
first place color eyes always struck peculiar 
figure countrymen 
many tall width shoulders strong build 
lastly wondered young mahratta endowed much energy readiness willing take heavy responsibilities shoulders full resource 
told story think right go join people 
everything disturbed nothing certain day day 
fugitive short time ago ere long may exile 
moreover one tell may happen 
people quarrelling tippoo quarrelled father hyder think long possible overthrow take possession territory 
various powers india united could english always find ready enter alliance enlarge dominions 
mahrattas may laugh idea overthrown small armies english generals command constant dissensions mutual jealousy holkar scindia peishwa rajah berar others prevent ever acting together 
may shall conquered piecemeal 
watched closely taken place southern india bengal 
seen handful traders gradually swallowing native powers seems may well time may become masters india 
say much princes would scoff prediction business learn passing elsewhere agents madras calcutta reports ever power english increasing 
years ago seemed french going carry like native princes gone english seem moreover get better french natives win respect liking 
well young sir shall sorry lose good reason seldom able trust give absolute confidence around always felt could wholly rely 
past year seen much freely told plans done others chosen missions could safety entrusted followers knowing scindia holkar would ready pay great sums secrets 
none except bajee sent particulars aware extent plans communication one rajahs 
played part marvellously well deemed possible one race could live long among us without exciting suspicion 
remain bombay hope act confidential agent 
ask divulge secrets may learn relating projects connected deccan like informed course affairs generally 
course dealings council must carried english resident much information respecting views council regard tippoo nizam bengal valuable know 
could act excellency without permission council imagine would averse arrangement especially perhaps would give private information state parties would care tell resident 
certainly would 
change residents frequently would impossible new men really understand situation intimate knowledge poona could readily grasp 
course arrangement could temporary position uncertain case life long one 
propose salary private agent thousand rupees month 
thank much sir stay bombay obtain permission council correspond readily undertake part 
little objection arrangement doubtless agents bombay already 
certainly natives necessarily send rumors current bazaars known generally public news part worthless 
another favor request harry said namely give leave absence sufder order may accompany bombay 
old nurse could alone substantiate birth identity would necessary give evidence legal authority 
readily 
sufder honest faithful rely upon absolutely anything sphere duty today appointed command two hundred men although hand ready strike brain capable planning 
raised higher position 
returns bombay grant revenues village shall patal mayor old age able live comfort 
leaving minister harry went sufder camp 
back puntojee yes brought soyera 
great news tell soldier went 
news sufder 
know command doubled captain two hundred men tell much 
accompany bombay day tomorrow give evidence birth furthermore nana return bestow upon jagheer revenue village district says grow old service able live comfortably 
good news indeed better even command two hundred men truth beginning weary service 
nearly fifty feel growing stiff 
nothing would please patal village community hold jagheer 
however long nana lives retains power shall remain soldier death shall serve master shall take country life 
nana know english yes told story 
obliged give reasons resigning nana support government bombay risk 
long get quite rid color sufder say 
think fortnight greater part faded maybe soyera knows something remove rapidly 
soyera asked said knew nothing would remove dye washed hands face two three times day strong lye made ashes plant grows everywhere plain would help get rid 
go tomorrow morning fetch 
made lye mixed oil made strong soap 
mean dress go harry choice even ride best court suit change english clothes got ghauts 
may come aught know better therefore one know english 
mr malet however solved difficulty evening harry went enquire time would start said thinking offering suit ride unfortunately clothes would great deal small 
however think best go 
first place would show advantage english clothes would feel tight uncomfortable first second place think perhaps well council see would better understand able pass mahratta years 
introduce colonel palmer 
important know possibly may sent mission favor nana would specially fitted 
accordingly next morning started early 
soyera prepared liquid soap decided go native dress harry thought well use especially dye gradually wearing 
party consisted mr malet sufder harry escort ten cavalrymen belonging one native regiments 
mission clerk transferred colonel palmer knowledge affairs would useful newcomer 
soyera carried dhoolie followed close behind troopers 
evening descended ghauts concan encamped following day rode bombay mr malet took hotel principally used natives rank visiting bombay 
best stay till send said harry 
shall see council tonight 
doubt formal meeting tomorrow ask opinion probability present state things continuing poona 
shall course tell story likely request go see therefore leave hotel hear 
sufder previously visited bombay next morning early went soyera guide inspect european part town 
much struck appearance neatness order fort solidity buildings 
strong place assuredly said harry return 
first place would necessary force attacking cross narrow isthmus causeway uniting island land would impossible face force provided artillery guarding 
succeeded winning would make way native town get maidan would defended guns batteries addition artillery land might swept guns board ship 
truly talked driving english sea known anything strength position 
carrying assault could done could garrison starved since could always obtain supplies sorts sea 
yet except causeway place natural strength 
mahrattas acted unwisely indeed allowed english settle 
could foresee future sufder 
doubtless sorry future british become masters india mahrattas reason regret given foothold 
wherever powers extend natives far better rule princes 
british masters would wars jealousies intrigues peasants would till fields peace men take soldiering would find peaceful modes earning living 
think surely harry leaving poona told call english ever become masters india conquered carnatic even safe forays hyder ali 
mysore bars way farther north 
nizam dealt berar mahrattas comes rajputana beyond sikhs fierce chiefs scinde 
true english beaten peoples lower bengal always looked upon despised cowardly effeminate fighting men india 
besides white soldiers say french promised tippoo send big army help drive english sea 
french quite work enough home harry said 
true got egypt shut fleets 
moreover even cross arabia could march across dry almost waterless country thousand two miles arrived scinde would find fighting men province sikhs opposed would never able fight way mysore 
thing absurd 
conversation interrupted arrival messenger government house request mr lindsay attend

next morning started daybreak 
miles town took uniforms harry put dress trader 
occasion disguise abdool like native troops accustomed drill day put native garments 
uniforms folded stowed wallets behind saddles 
brought good supply grain horses provisions might stop village 
rode steady pace mounted ghauts eleven clock 
waited three hours feed rest animals sun setting entered poona accomplished journey fifty miles 
knowing place well harry rode quiet street near bazaar seeing old man one doors asked knew anyone could afford accommodation servant 
man said 
alone house 
two merchants staying left yesterday let house except one room 
stables suppose sahib outhouse would hold two horses 
illustration little haggling terms 
little haggling terms would altogether contrary indian usages agreed price without demur 
finally matter arranged price halfway man demanded offered harry short time settled two rooms second floor 
harry went bought two thick quilted cushions used mattresses two native blankets 
still provisions enough evening 
furniture scanty consisting raised bed place divan two tables raised foot ground brass basins large earthenware jars water 
harry however well accustomed consider accommodation insufficient 
tomorrow said get carpet sitting upon get copper vessels cooking 
abdool presently went returned two large bundles forage horses 
soon afterwards lay feeling stiff tired unaccustomed exertions 
next morning harry went residency 
painted caste marks face completely changed appearance 
telling guard come bombay message colonel palmer shown 
bring message colonel said shortly time writing despatch 
yes sir harry answered mahratti 
come assistant 
mr lindsay resident exclaimed dropping pen rising feet 
received despatch yesterday saying coming 
course remember seen day came dress altogether different expression face seems changed 
result adopted different caste marks larger lines almost cover forehead 
expect come disguise 
governor thought colonel might greater service finding passing town going elsewhere come native 
officer residency parties would keep lips sealed 
thoroughly agree resident said 
disguise differs much former appearance think acquaintances days would likely recognize 
present supposed trader dress peasant small cultivator used went scindia camp 
also dress brahmin one better class thought necessary would enable enter house nana leaders without exciting surprise 
also uniform 
staying present street faces market house man named naroo 
bhaskur 
soldier servant confidently rely send chit news give send word hour better call 
colonel orders indicate nature news wish gain person want watched best 
present know nothing changes taken place since left 
event publicly known peishwa carried engagement scindia rajah berar refused ratify treaty nizam consequence latter general quitted poona without taking leave bajee rao returned great indignation hyderabad 
matter might smoothed scindia intervened peishwa made suitable advances nizam done 
doubt thoroughly dislikes nana furnuwees instead grateful placed throne would gladly weaken power 
rate nana formed confederacy know greatest wish keep intact secure peace country 
moreover matters complicated death holkar 
left two sons behind khassee mulhar 
unfortunately khassee next door imbecile mulhar bold able prince 
brothers quarrelled two half brothers took part mulhar left brother camp small body troops took abode village outside city believe favored nana whose interest naturally active able prince ruler holkar dominions 
scindia suspect delighted quarrel holkar camp supported khassee sent body troops arrest mulhar refusing surrender maintained desperate defense killed 
jeswunt went nagpore wittoojee fled kolapoore almost adherents mulhar effected escape 
matters stand present 
fact imbecile khassee owes elevation scindia naturally give latter predominating influence 
thus see confederacy gone completely pieces 
nizam estranged rajah berar gone home nagpore holkar power time subservient scindia nana furnuwees therefore deprived aided bring back power 
well known nana yes colonel kind enough place good deal confidence 
think better see begin gather views matter 
heard nothing time 
knows company well disposed towards also knows give assistance sudden crisis 
surely colonel bajee rao owes everything desert opinion peishwa man without spark good feeling neither conscience gratitude would betray brother thought would obtain advantage 
born schemer sole idea politics play one faction another 
would rather take word man lowest class oath bajee rao 
sorry hear sir 
seemed fine fellow many accomplishments 
handsome face figure winning manner manner part stock trade colonel said angrily 
born actor deceive time even perfectly aware unscrupulous character 
remember one thing mr lindsay difficulty tumult breaks city best make way 
trooper escort thrown horse killed day attire uniform pass one 
whatever happens likely touched 
parties wish stand well even found englishman would safely sheltered claim assistant officer army declare truthfully assumed guise order ascertain feelings populace 
thank sir 
certainly come soon serious trouble begins 
evening rubbing caste marks assuming brahmin putting dress suitable padding largely give appearance stout bulky man went nana house 
tell minister said doorkeeper kawerseen brahmin kshittree caste desires speak man gave message one attendants two three minutes returned asked harry follow 
minister alone 
say holy man enquired looking fixedly visitor exclaimed puntojee right nana 
sent ascertain possible going things likely tend 
first must tell colonel palmer assistant 
take entirely confidence nana said 
told englishman took leave two years ago could quite understand felt could confide older men around 
esteem english highly especially admire honesty truthfulness 
impressed one possessing qualities know english understand feeling inspired 
glad come 
doubt government well informed state affairs 
feel power slipping hands without seeing way recover lost ground 
scindia solely domination ghatgay whose daughter shortly marry 
course made business enquire antecedents man 
find reputation brutal ruffian remarkable alike greed cruelty worse adviser scindia could 
holkar poor reed lean upon weak mind body 
rate true friend mine succeeded one even imbecile puppet hands scindia whose troops owes accession power dominions practically scindia doubt whatever bajee rao acting secretly scindia say pretending act master duplicity even interests concerned seems unable carry honestly agreement made 
old man mr lindsay longer struggle two years ago fate indeed see means contending powerful enemies 
rajah berar although well disposed towards could venture alone support united power scindia holkar backed peishwa 
one direction could seek help namely government bombay even given would scarcely avail much power enemies 
even sure could would call 
aim life uphold power peishwa lessen scindia holkar playing one avert horrors civil war 
call aid english acting contradiction principles ever held 
arrival force english would unite whole mahrattas last ascended ghauts believing great valor discipline amply shown conduct scindia infantry mainly officered europeans beyond belief withstand whole power mahratta empire 
granting might would result see country shaken center capital hands strangers end simply old worn man years remain power 
would necessary placed remain guardians mere cypher hands 
nothing therefore would persuade seek english aid retain power 
english would doubtless act alliance nizam probably rajahs berar kolapoore 
possibly might would result leaders would return aid bargain increased territory expense peishwa believe trusted great mass people become object execration brought invaders country 
mr lindsay enemies believe capture throw prison 
scarcely take life would excite storm indignation always carry poison applied torture preliminary death power releasing hands 
established residency sir living disguises several town 
way better discover going uniform assistant colonel palmer 
tumult city find disguise detected make residency either put uniform declare true character attire one resident escort 
come often nana said 
shall always glad see 
relief speak one whose friendship feel secure 
brahmin pass without suspicion always tell matters stand 
yet spoken nana work agent bombay 
sent reports time time nothing could value 
present attentions authorities bombay madras calcutta centred upon probability war mysore 
tippoo continually broken conditions made peace us six years ago known preparing war 
received honor many frenchmen communication french government believes supported army general bonaparte certain war breaks need fighting strength three towns make head army mysore far able learn given little attention state affairs deccan 
therefore able furnish useful information beyond telling sympathies governor council wholly consider fact power secures trouble mahrattas 
therefore sir put aside allowance given considering way earned written order upon bankers placed authorizing pay money anyone may depute receive handed letter nana 
latter took without opening tore 
offer honor mr lindsay impossible accept 
information without advantages 
foreseen nizam would probably enter alliance people large increase made battalions foreign officers intended make alliance valuable 
however deemed necessary imitate example scindia raising similar force 
communications therefore real value saved large outlay even question returning pay 
undertook certain work best powers carried consider information sent sufficiently valuable way failed carry part contract 
consider great value 
first place said relieved anxiety nizam intentions increasing army second place eased mind showing neither scindia holkar intriguing bombay knowledge worth crore rupees 
first time sir since taken part politics anyone offered return money received ground sufficiently earned indeed upon ground whatever 
confirmed opinion honesty people would feeling common among countrymen 
negotiations carried alliance formed without demand large sum money addition territory 
petty wars waged question principle entirely greed 
let us say 
course heard wealthy man distributed money among shroffs india whatever may happen shall lose comparatively little glad know small portion goes one regard genuine friend draw tenth part many around accept without consideration given 
thank sir rate stationed assistant resident continue receive pay 
regard disgraceful action absolutely incompatible duty 
well far humor mr lindsay though hear carnatic bengal british officers civil military hesitate accept large sums native princes 
harry well aware many british officials amassed considerable fortunes gifts native sources 
replied matter consciences sir 
may rewards services rendered hesitate accept sum generously bestowed upon 
judge men think custom officials accepting presents bad one 
find nana said changing subject need communicate call harry gave address 
messenger must enquire bhaskur trader ahmedabad lodging 
chatted time longer nana took leave returned lodging 
chapter act treachery 
months passed quietly 
scindia openly assumed supreme power imprisoned several leading men transferred jagheers relations 
colonel palmer gone bombay leave place filled temporarily mr uhtoff 
bajee usual playing deep game 
desired become independent scindia nana furnuwees 
former believed must sooner later return dominions desired aid get rid nana therefore latter intrigues present directed 
minister still object affection people believed goodness character put every act oppression work scindia 
harry saw nana frequently 
change position little talk politics minister generally turned conversation upon england power relatively france extent resources modes life among population methods government 
differs widely nana said one conversations respects better 
changes made force representatives people assembly 
minister defeated retires chief opponent succeeds 
army determining voice conduct affairs wholly orders minister may happen power 
seems strange us undoubtedly system far better population 
bloodshed burning villages plundering confiscation estates 
change personnel government change general course affairs 
strange soldiers fight well tell never carry arms enter army trained childhood use weapons 
enemies french nana far civil life concerned none carry weapons trained use 
one wide point difference 
french go soldiers reach certain age however much may dislike us compulsion whatever men enlist army might take trade 
however body called militia 
like army consists volunteers liable service abroad goes short period training annually 
however law supply volunteers fall short battalions kept full strength men chosen ballot population 
practically dead letter told ballot never resorted though doubtless would case national emergency 
ah pleasant minister country fear plots treachery assassination 
younger man like visit england stay time return could model institutions upon 
fear would much powerful minister effect 
people wedded old customs would change others however much might benefit 
order none save army carry arms would unite whole people issued 
last day nana furnuwees made formal visit scindia return one latter paid days

harry enjoyed much luxurious method traveling quite new three weeks leaving coast arrived nagpore 
previous day native officer sent beforehand inform rajah arrival high officer governor general taken letter lord mornington accrediting harry act name 
accordingly party arrived within mile town met two officers rajah welcomed name said residence prepared use escort 
surprised harry perfect knowledge language hitherto british agents come nagpore slight acquaintance carry conversation means interpreter

harry conducted one largest brick houses town 
host sweepers work carpets laid furniture placed principal rooms 
doubt requisitioned owner rajah furniture supplied palace 
principal rooms upper floor ample accommodation escort 
harry requested officers ascertain rajah would ready receive visit returned word would receive private audience eight clock evening 
accordingly hour followed four troopers rode palace 
guard honor drawn entrance saluted passed 
entrance hall staircase lined attendants bowed profoundly passed 
conducted large audience chamber rajah attended principal officers seated 
conversation usual ceremonial kind prince expressing satisfaction governor general sent one officers confer assuring harry goodwill friendship towards english harry part expressed strong desire lord mornington relations rajah continued unbroken nothing ever occur disturb amity 
presents sent governor general brought displayed appeared give much satisfaction chief 
durbar latter told harry would receive privately ten clock next morning 
arriving time shown prince private apartment explained governor general desire join confederacy nizam english 
quarrel tippoo rajah said 
present none say affair end 
say peishwa agreed assist tippoo 
match nizam know whether english company tippoo strongest 
remain neutral peishwa tippoo might eat 
true rajah must remember last war english showed much stronger tippoo glad make peace giving nearly half territories 
much stronger 
ships arrive day troops believe tippoo assuredly unable stand english power even backed whole strength poona 
course know messages sent tippoo promised large slice nizam dominions invade prevent aiding english 
harry saw change prince countenance surprised find negotiations tippoo known english government 
replied however true tippoo sent given answer 
matter important settled hurry 
certainly tippoo offers advantageous 
understand tempting rajah yet entailed war english nizam finished tippoo 
instead gaining territory would find much would lost 
undoubtedly join us governor general would show unthankful service assistance would handsomely recompensed 
governor general offer desirous knowing views rajah assuredly meet possible 
thought yet prince said 
must talk matter councillors 
good friends peishwa also nizam tippoo 
know english great people nothing save complimentary messages exchanged 
therefore matter upon one come hasty decision 
governor general would wish think matter well deciding rajah indeed occasion undue haste seeing english army still lying near madras yet ready advance 
therefore leave matter present believing wisdom able see matters likely go whether english company tippoo likely best friends 
nearly fortnight harry heard rajah 
latter returned visit sent presents sweetmeats food guests 
end time came one evening two attendants 
come speak matter privately said 
ministers altogether divided opinion 
say fight tippoo cruel implacable foe slaughtered hindus territory refused embrace religion 
others say better friends seems white men intend eat india 
already taken carnatic bengal want take mysore 
take next wish well english 
though brave strong council know offer tippoo made us unless show english also ready give us material advantages shall able persuade chiefs interest must lie alliance 
rajah inform expectations see far tally governor general authorized offer 
greedy prince said 
wish fair 
think aid worth two crores rupees pounds company put possession lands purseram bhow together land lies us malwan including territories rajah bhopal 
demand harry said gravely far beyond authorized offer fear altogether useless submit governor general 
would sure consider naming terms resolved make acceptance impossible 
means intention rajah said 
nothing could thoughts order secure alliance believe would advantageous might able make slight concession 
send messenger submitting offer asking instructions requesting may allowed meet concessions part fear strained english treasury preparations war tippoo would impossible company pay sum name think would disposed guarantee territory bhopal seeing quarrel rajah country 
doubt might willing grant portion territories mysore lying side godavery would valuable bhopal 
rajah still uncertain side would advantageous take thought campaign tippoo would last many months offered objection harry proposal 
latter sent two troopers next day letter lord mornington saying rajah demands knew altogether question sent simply gain time hoping answer arrived army would gained successes tippoo would induce prince greatly modify terms 
troopers charged use undue haste travel quietly rate exceeding twenty miles day 
two months passed 
rajah hurry two parties among councillors evenly divided means sure even wished could put army motion support either english tippoo next place believed latter would win reluctant extreme take step would draw upon vengeance lord mysore 
occasionally saw harry although expressed anxiety return messengers harry could see feeling feigned heart sorry yet called upon decide 
end month harry received letter governor general brought messenger disguise peasant 
said march th 
army left vellore 
th nizam contingent also marched bombay 
st month reached plateau bombay army sedaseer forty five miles west seringapatam main army eighty miles east town 
end month tippoo capital 
siege probably occupy month 
even berar decides us army arrive time aid tippoo 
therefore extend negotiations month receive mission fulfilled 
messenger course sent arrival troopers calcutta lord mornington calculations correct seringapatam would invested could return 
three days later indeed report reached nagpore tippoo fallen upon advance guard bombay army repulsed th attacked general harris defeated th main army forded cauvery marched sosilly 
news caused great excitement town although seringapatam generally supposed impregnable english failed take last war believed another futile siege would forced fall back want food upon previous occasion 
rajah like majority believed seringapatam could defy assault surrounded british army would mysore cavalry would speedily forced retire although tippoo might yielded wishes general attempted check advance could portion army 
including contingent furnished nizam bombay army amounted forty three thousand men 
tippoo credited least twice force uniform successes neighbors created belief invincible 
rajah therefore well content let matters rest decisive news reached 
th april messengers returned letter longer want active assistance berar 
army within striking distance seringapatam thousand native horse one way another make little difference 
done well gaining two months referring matter 
rajah demands course ridiculous 
evidently playing double part defeated tomorrow would join tippoo attack nizam 
still however offer five lakhs rupees guarantee additional territory 
peishwa acting precisely way 
army come assistance yet moved like berar simply awaiting events seringapatam 
rajah came evening 
hear messengers returned sir 
yes sorry say governor general considers demands altogether excessive 
treasury almost empty guarantee extension dominions would bring war peishwa rajah bhopal willing pay five lakhs rupees cover maintenance troops field 
rajah flushed anger 
altogether insufficient said 
say final offer rajah offer authorized make first place 
possibly willing make concessions reasonable kind may able meet must remember friendship company slight advantage would assuredly infinite value territory invaded scindia peishwa 
may moment make differences 
purseram bhow may become commander peishwa army manner troops last two three years raided jagheer would bitterest enemy 
harry saw consideration made powerful impression upon rajah latter said must think matters 
sum offer altogether insufficient entertained moment 
however time reflection 
next four weeks harry saw rajah occasionally latter made attempt talk business 
evidently undecided mind best course take 
feared tippoo feared english still believed latter would assuredly fail capturing seringapatam 
tippoo offers considerably higher calcutta promised large slice nizam dominions assistance 
therefore determined reject english offer march nizam country soon heard besieging army fallen back 
harry suspicions case certain extent confirmed fact bodies armed men began arrive considerable numbers 
felt position beginning precarious native officer commanding escort brought almost hourly reports passing city 
population mixed one nearly divided hindus mahommedans 
latter naturally sympathized altogether tippoo former favor taking part either side 
matters continued th may horseman rode town news seringapatam captured british tippoo killed 
feeling akin stupefaction excited news seemed first must false incredible tippoo strong army unable defend fortress believed could withstand attack however formidable four months 
illustration rode streets saw fierce feeling resentment excited news 
rajah sent ask harry visit 
rode streets saw scowling faces mahommedan soldiers fierce feeling resentment excited news native officer brought minutes 
rajah deeply agitated 
heard news sahib rajah 
think possible perfectly indeed expecting days supposed english general needed time bring provisions country round form plans construct batteries 
astounding rajah said walking room

noticed time gathering large force given indication purpose intended 
intended course service english rajah said would set motion soon negotiations completed 
rate rajah spite temptations offered tippoo remained neutral 
considered favor assure breach friendship english matters merely remain war commenced 
except nizam become powerful rajah said 
doubt certainly take considerable share tippoo dominions 
need trouble 
know desire governor general always peace 
driven war failure tippoo carry undertaking release european prisoners hands also great preparations making regain territory lost 
interest company nizam use increased power scourge neighbors promise wanton aggression part regarded displeasure probably lead interference behalf 
rajah must remind guest rely upon protect 
came streets attitude mahommedan soldiers threatening surprised attempted attack house 
need say outrage upon escort british agent would tremendously avenged would easily forgiven taken part tippoo allow escort massacred 
take immediate steps safety attempt made shall come household guards assistance 
squadron shall ride back prevent insult offered streets 
relieve presence tonight harry said 
wish object strife people therefore take farewell

give assurance disposition wholly friendly rely nothing much secure friendship remain amicable terms 
harry doubt assurance given earnest 
fall seringapatam death tippoo terrible shock rajah even fact missed opportunity allying english nothing thought would happened declared tippoo

present time tumangong chief justice obtained possession island singapore adjacent district mainland chiefs also thrown allegiance rajah johore usurped power former reigning family 
said want obtain place trade tumangong doubt person must obtain wanted whole island would treat rajah case latter defeat overthrow tumangong certainly would recognize cession island 
good port needed 
hurricanes bay bengal china seas indeed among islands vessels anchor coast safety times year 
island like covered forest jungle malay replied 
inhabitants hundred fifty 
people chinese bugis 
malays cultivators 
live piracy attacking small native vessels passing narrow passages singapore mainland 
chinese cultivate patches land 
fertile 
rain falls half days year 
chinese would make garden 
better even land part sumatra produce spices grains sorts 
malay peninsula would wealthy split several kingdoms always war 
singapore great place 
seven hundred years ago capital whole malay kingdom taken hundred years afterwards king java malacca became malay capital 
affair seem promising harry said repeating fairclough heard malay 
experience indian princes little trust placed agreement made 
keep long suits break without slightest sense done anything dishonourable 
seems position much like deccan 
scindia holkar rajahs berar kolapoore practically independent peishwa maintains semblance authority 
interpreter tells seems puppet rajah today possesses authority whatever tomorrow may excite quarrel among chiefs become master 
think first place shall see semi independent chief whose possessions singapore forms part afterwards rajah johore nominal master 
latter may view matter one two ways 
first place may consider island importance whatever seeing even master revenue could obtained handful people living would therefore glad ratify cession us small sum 
hand may consider elevation island position great european trading port would add greatly power importance tumangong might enable make master whole johore 
seems complicated business certainly sailor replied 
see though rebel chap written calcutta may trusted receive hospitably saying rajah may think 
clear get rajah harry remarked 
tumangong would doubt object going beyond considers territory might seem let would recognizing power rajah interfere business 
however certain must carry home clear report situation must rate attempt see rajah 
course must endeavor learn malays island whether johore still holds territory running sea whether coast chiefs also revolted 
first case send native say mission governor general india visit court cut sea must endeavor make way somehow 
would never return half story 
suppose governor general aware state things chief communicated acknowledged rajah johore 
doubt possession island would great value us would become center trade east islands round except course belonging holland 
therefore first essential point ascertain whether old rajah likely regain former authority whether recognize terms cession island us 
well glad lindsay business mine seems difficult affair somewhat dangerous one 
three weeks leaving calcutta brig reached island harry request sailed round taking soundings frequently order obtain knowledge depth water nature sea bottom 
finally anchored straits mainland 
varied width two miles quarter mile depth water eastern extremity straits found insufficient vessels large tonnage though navigable ordinary native craft 
island twenty five miles long fifteen miles wide fairclough calculated third larger isle wight 
high hills seen whole island undulating everywhere covered forest jungle 
several small malay canoes put fruit interpreter told smallness population clearly chance attack made brig allowed come alongside 
supply fruit welcome interpreter learned something natives state things mainland 
however appeared take little interest 
admitted tumangong lord poor levy contributions mastership merely nominal one trouble 
time send officer troops exact tribute money would simply retire interior could defy pursuit 
heard reports wars mainland beyond fact rajah possessed little authority unable give information 
vaguely heard chiefs supported family former rajah

two bottles put upon table malays tasting cautiously first consumed greater portion two officers sipping occasionally filling glasses keep others countenance 
accustomed fiery beverages obtained traders dutch possessions malays way affected potations although evidently impressed superiority english dutch rivals tumangong remarked truly english must great people make liquors 
dutch sell us fiery drinks flavor compared

delay matter might get news malacca trading stations sumatra ship case would guess thinking establishing trading station might send make terms tumangong 
doubt open free port great damage divert large portion eastern trade much handy country craft trading siam china besides advantage avoiding heavy dues demanded dutch 
doubt best way fairclough said

think lord mornington could hardly informed great number islands inhabited malays great naval force would required overawe punish freebooters bold hesitate attack traders even large ships carrying guns protection 
nothing short great fleet cruisers would suffice 
next place undertake operations large scale malays throughout islands would unite us might revenge assail many ports us enormous damage 
even fleet performed half work would sufferers 
certainly sufficient vessels war attempt operation even governor general india send many vessels disposal force would altogether inadequate extensive operations 
islands counted hundreds approach ships war people would desert villages seashore take interior would cases impossible follow damage could inflict would burn villages could rebuilt ships sailed away 
exterminate piracy would work months many years

chapter defence johore 
half hour later little party way 
stiff first passing night sitting attitude long able break trot 
kept hour great satisfaction forest abruptly ceased saw distance mile half little town johore lying cultivated fields extended edge forest 
broke walk short distance continued former pace could tell close pursuers might behind 
long saw men work fields 
interpreter shouted party enemy far behind throwing tools also made town spreading alarm went 
fresh fleet footed arrived minutes harry party entered place found whole population street men armed spears krises 
asking way soon reached rajah palace consisted central house round number huts built whole surrounded stone wall eight feet high 
rajah arrived questioning people cause sudden alarm 
greatly surprised sight harry full uniform attended one soldier native 
comes arrive like asked angrily 
explain happened harry said interpreter 
rajah brow darkened heard escort sent slain man previous day 
excitement increased told strong force enemy gathered within miles town assault might immediately expected 
tell rajah used warfare shall glad assist best power defense town many men rajah asked 
think couple thousand harry replied 
matchlocks greater part spear kris 
five hundred rajah said 
hope resist 
think go round town see harry said 
may accustomed war suggest means strengthening defences may hold enemy 
rajah heard many tales fighting powers whites said go 
would defend place could johore lost fugitive 
within would killed beg asylum master 
calling party men follow rajah accompanied harry edge town 
already surrounded palisade great strength circumference fully mile half 
tell rajah could make first defense fighting men numerous enough hold large circuit four times number 
suggest whole population set work build another palisade much nearer palace 
women children sent inside provisions town taken palace enclosure large supply water stored 
soon new palisade finished spared defense set work throw bank earth wall upon fighting men take places able defend palace assault 
rajah listened attentively interpreter 
english officer words good said timber palisades speaks 
tell rajah harry said interpreted plenty wood bamboos huts stand outside line new palisade pull use materials 
moreover case would well level houses enemy fired would almost certain fire houses inside palisade 
rajah face brightened 
tone assurance harry spoke reassured said interpreter tell officer people shall tells point defense must erected 
harry long fixing upon line entrenchments 
two hundred yards diameter rajah orders whole men women town set work pull huts standing within fifty sixty yards 
work couple hours materials carried line 
stronger timbers first planted holes dug intervals filled bamboo poles 
inside face bamboos lashed rattans across 
fast used houses pulled defense completed crossbars nine inches apart 
work performed men women children brought provisions precious belongings 
carried inside wall palace 
two clock work finished rest half hour 
set work dig trench three feet deep perpendicular sides distance two feet palisade 
large store bamboos slender use palisade sharpened cut lengths two feet planted thickly bottom trench 
others five feet long sharpened thrust interstices upright bamboos ends fixed firmly ground inside sharpened points projected like row bayonets height two feet edge ditch 
nightfall work finished 
rajah time upon spot delighted saw formidable obstacle raised 
one small entrance alone left women children passed lay space new palisade wall palace 
men ordered take post behind stockade number boys sent act scouts give notice enemy approached 
rajah however opinion enemy would know alarm would given fugitives arrival inhabitants would guard would attack till daylight 
harry invitation gone midnight house partaken food also sent abdool interpreter 
rajah would continued work night harry dissuaded saying six hours sleep everyone would work better 
one clock horn sounded exception men left outer palisade set work 
men employed digging trench foot depth inside inner palisade throwing earth front lie protected arrows spears time rise feet repel actual assault 
women children filled baskets earth thrown outer trench previous day carried inside wall five clock bank two feet high raised platform bamboos three feet high eighteen inches wide erected 
work scarcely finished horn sounded outside town boys came running men ran outer palisade 
day broke great numbers dark figures seen making way fields three sides town 
band saw must joined another 
certainly two thousand men 
undoubtedly carry outer palisade 
many men killed many others unable join us 
think much better rely defense alone 
great confidence harry judgment rajah ordered horn sounded short time whole men assembled stronghold entrance closed bamboos holes already dug close together 
short lengths lashed across strengthened bank earth piled 
quite finished yells triumph heard enemy finding palisade unguarded poured expecting find inhabitants fled news approach 
paused however surprise seeing another line defense outside palace 
quickly numbers increased thick line dark figures gathered edge cleared space 
inside defense quiet 
man showed 
doubtful whether town entirely evacuated malays paused little time chiefs gathered together consultation 
men advanced evident intention examining defences 
allowed approach within ten yards ditch shower arrows flew openings palisade two malays fled back companions 
fall others provoked wild yells anger 
horn sounded assailants rushed upon sides 
within yards ditch hurled spears shot cloud arrows 
large proportion stopped bamboos passed flew harmlessly heads defenders replied far deadly shower arrows 
leaping fallen enemy dashed forward 
front endeavored check course arriving edge ditch forced pressure behind long spears defenders gleamed openings bamboos inflicting terrible damage 
vain assailants endeavored climb ditch 
bayonet like line bamboos checked arrows concealed defenders told terrible effect struggling mass 
last many points ditch literally filled dead assailants enabled leap upon line bamboos long checked passage 
advantage slight 
slippery poles six inches apart slanting afforded poor foothold malays forced stand narrow ledge palisading ditch 
thrust spears palisade wrenched hands scores fell blows kris spear arrow last leaders chiefs seeing terrible slaughter impossible climb bamboo fence called men fell back pursued exulting cries women standing platform behind wall palace watching conflict yells defenders stockade 
fallen five hundred assailants perished 
rajah almost beside joy crushing defeat enemy 
suppose yet rajah harry said interpreter 
still five times number surely retire without endeavoring avenge defeat 
hardly think attack stockade 
possibly try fire next time harder fight keep men bay 
rajah looked serious 
yes said return homes say left five hundred dead behind 
advise hardly attack today rajah therefore shall time think 
present seems course shoot many bring firebrands possible 
still number long bamboos left might thrust away burning faggots might cast palisade 
rajah nodded 
might done said success doubt 
success many points rajah succeed one point establishing big fire stockade must retire within wall 
burn us except gate must pile earth stones 
certainly recommend roofs buildings inside taken unless indeed sufficient hides cover 
still need driven inside wall 
takes short time take broad leaves roofs covered 
fight harry taken active part conflict 
divided circle three taken charge one division abdool taking another rajah third 
encouraged men gone pressure attack severe 
leaving rajah harry joined abdool 
try abdool think try carry stockade assault 
try fire sahib 
afraid 
archers shoot good many numbers make little difference must calculate least dozen spots place blazing faggots palisade 
abdool nodded 
telling rajah harry went men must provide long bamboos thrust openings stockade push faggots away 
even must calculate upon enemy succeeding places setting palisades fire 
would serious course go behind wall 
want long possibly stay 
think night comes ought make sortie 
sahib defeat abdool beat 
see wind always blows evening sea 
noticed last night 
quite strong 
propose would pull enough bamboos four men go together side facing wind 
two hundred men first sally remaining close ditch 
ready crawl across cleared ground signal attack enemy taken surprise would sure give way first 
attack fifty men torches rush follow set fire many huts 
soon done work run back signal given 
two advantages first place sudden attack disconcert enemy render less willing expose lives storming place desperately held second place wind carry flame whole town hope burning fragrants carry flames fields crops dry thus causing much difficulty obtaining dry wood faggots exposed arrows much longer throw stockade 
would excellent sahib think men would go present moment would anything half wild excitement triumph 
harry presently went interpreter rajah house 
plan propose said render much difficult enemy set fire stockade explained scheme 
rajah eyes glistened excitement 
nothing could better said one fear enemy follow us hotly enter breach close 
thought harry said order must signal given men must throw torches man must run hole stockade nearest point keep along outside ditch enter 
way point entered would known moreover would able enter rapidly much less confusion arrived together crowd 
party would course left breach sally moment last man entered would replace lash bamboos position 
however hotly pursued guards remain outside keep bay bamboos one replaced 
leave opening sufficient one man must fall back fighting 
certainly would venture follow us narrow passage 
two hundred fifty men brought inside wall rajah explained duty upon would employed 
told fifty torch bearers explained carefully plan harry devised gave strict orders sound whatever must made reached houses harry request impressed upon absolute necessity allowing ardor carry far torches must thrown everyone run back soon horn sounded 
doubt order satisfactory one 
men raised krises spears shouted joy 
present mood nothing could please thought attack upon assailants 
remained quiet sides darkness fell crash falling huts showed enemy intended use fire begin work making faggots 
attack hour daybreak rajah said may perhaps wait till sun daylight carried torches would conspicuous would advance midst whole force 
time likely sleep many sleep early said readiness fight 
others sit talk night intend sleep probably couple hours 
think likely place guards dream boldness attack 
let us give three hours harry said sea wind blowing strongly 
greater portion men remain behind stationed side sortie made cover retreat others showers arrows 
rajah principal officer placed command 
orders enemy came strongly issue hundred men aid party beat back assailants 
however harry think likely would case 
malays would scattered town perhaps even beyond outer palisades could assemble force party ought safe within palisade 
ten two hundred men make attack sallied 
led rajah harry lead firing party 
chose part would able crawl across open space noiselessly malays could 
day number hides hung palisades enemy notice gathering men torches assembled order light might conspicuous spot fires lighted points order give impression defenders holding readiness repel another attack 
bamboos removed ten minutes party issued 
noiseless tread harry though close entrance could hear looked soon last man passed could neither see hear anything 
men thrown ground soon passed crawling forward without sound audible 
harry abdool armed kris spear 
behind torch bearers arranged four abreast 
seemed age sound horn rose air 
instantly dashed opening followed men full speed crossed cleared ground 
already sound shouts violent yells clashing blades showed rajah men work 
scattering reached houses torch bearers ran hut hut pausing seconds till flame gained fair hold 
less minute sixty seventy houses flames 
harry man horn soon saw work fairly done ordered signal blown 
torches thrown bearers ran back full speed half minute later rajah men poured town 
pursuit whole band entered stockade yells fury numbers enemy ran forward 
soon arrows began fly fast stockade knowing could effect nothing without means breaking malays retired rapidly advanced 
short interval elapsed since first signal given town point attack made sheet flame spreading rapidly either hand 
hubbub among enemy tremendous 
upwards hundred killed rajah party part could offer resistance five six assailants received severe wounds 
loud rose shouts exultation defenders fire spread ever increasing rapidity flakes fire driven strong wind started flames score places far ahead main conflagration half hour red embers flickering timbers showed johore stood 
beyond however sheets flame crops dry ready cutting garrison felt assailants would go long distance gather materials endeavoring burn 
position surrounded zone fire rajah harry suggestion sent whole men women cast earth dead piled four five points thickly ditch 
matter delayed another day said air poisoned well nigh impossible exist 
rajah admitted urged men would want cut heads fallen enemies general custom among malays 
may rajah could carried without great danger 
lives depend upon getting quickly buried 
custom cutting heads country affair mine 
bodies lie fact grave hours labor would means saving town pestilence later 
enemy depart advise build great mound earth trench 
record grand defense placing strong stockade along top would strengthen position greatly 
recommend case clear space within far wall houses build town entirely outside 
great dissatisfaction among natives prevented taking seemed natural trophies 
rajah informed order given consequence white officer advice set work readily morning dead hidden sight deep layer earth 
next day passed without incident 
nightfall sharp lookout kept palisade top rajah house 
thought enemy considerable numbers seen going forest would bring faggots closely possible lighting 
still would necessary carry brands purpose ground cleared huts least brands could seen even carefully hidden 
exception guards slept day necessary vigilant night enemy might occasion approach earlier hour hoping find garrison unprepared 
harry abdool paced round round platform wall although fires burned among fields glimmer light could seen town stood 
wish knew abdool harry said midnight 
like silence 
perhaps gone away sahib 
hardly think 
believe shall another attack morning 
may bring ladders climbing palisade may try fire convinced something 
position strong 
bamboos set men dig another ditch defend like first used 
wish rockets could send one time time see 
another hour passed malays declared could hear sound many men moving 
harry listened vain knew malays senses much keener 
went rajah 
chief till midnight retired leaving orders called directly alarm sort given 
seated two three councillors talking harry interpreter entered 
people say hear sounds rajah 
hear nothing know hearing keener mine 
uneasy even see faintest glow would tell fire brought 
opinion better leave two hundred men palisade bring rest 
lead point hotly attacked would prevent confusion stockade suddenly forced 
enemy may bringing hundreds ladders darkness may get close noticed 
think best rajah said went sent officers bring three hundred men also harry suggestion tell others rajah horn sounded leave stockade make entrance wall 
another half hour passed 
even harry conscious low dull sound air 
think rajah standing wall close gate said harry 
however numerous may moved noiselessly went attack 
think long know rajah 
scarcely spoken loud shout palisade front 
side men posted thickly things necessary defend last order enable points make way gate 
shout alarm followed almost instantly sound horn immediately tremendous yell resounded sides 
answered shouts garrison moment later score balls composed matting dipped oil resinous gum thrown flaming palisades 
prepared previous day men charged throwing earthenware pot containing glowing charcoal beside 
light showed groups men twenty thirty strong advancing within twenty yards palisade 
carrying trees batter stockade rajah said harry 
behind carrying parties dense crowd malays rushed forward soon fireballs fell hurling spears shooting arrows defenders replied vigorously 
stockade stand moment trees continued 
tis best call men 
rajah ordered native beside sound horn two three minutes men poured entrance 
soon last come bamboos put holes prepared rattans twined 
scores men set work bringing earth stones piled close hand 
meantime three hundred men walls kept shower arrows enemy 
battering rams consisted trees stripped branches forty feet long ten inches thick work time entrance secure malays poured exultant shouts 
large supply fireballs placed platforms lighted thrown assailants exposed deadly shower arrows rushed forward 
moment rajah servant brought four double barrelled guns 
loaded chief said handed one harry 
long since fired latter asked 
three months since last went shooting rajah replied 
harry proceeded draw charges 
advise rajah 
gun fired three months likely carry straight dangerous owner enemy 
rajah called two men one drew charges guns reloaded powder horn bag bullets servants brought 
enemy press attack retired behind palisades shelter began shoot arrows fast matchlock men also replied 
would well rajah order men sit 
use exposing arrows wasting 
must wait see next move 
fire use wall take battering gives way brave men may could work battering rams shower spears arrows would poured upon 
send greater part men get roofs huts 
must place man two watch side throw fireball occasionally 
moments enemy ceased shooting arrows light fireballs showed garrison shelter 
occasion stay longer rajah 
look matters morning send soon stir outside 
half hour huts stripped combustible material 
heaped platforms would safe falling arrows 
women drew pots water well hundred men left courtyard orders pull stamp flaming arrows might fall 
time went evident assailants thought providing materials requisite greater part garrison lay quietly slept 
harry waited saw work courtyard completed interpreter entered rajah house 
room generally used empty 
lamps burning laid divan malay curled floor 
harry slept short time awakened light touch shoulder springing saw woman boy six years old standing beside 
woman placed finger lips imploringly 
harry roused interpreter 
woman explained widow late rajah son lawful heir throne

forgive thus disturbed house save asleep thought opportunity would occur 
teach son english friends aught happen ever become rajah act friend also 
interpreted harry boy left room noiselessly entered 
harry well pleased interview 
probably present man would result struggle became known regain much power lost 
assuredly long remained rajah would ready grant anything asked singapore virtually lost assent would given without hesitation 
hand dethroned died likely boy would time become rajah view possibility doubtless governor would order time mother arrived singapore well received

next day number men came villages scattered among hills heard approach enemy late enter town take part defense 
time scouts penetrated far forest brought back news although many dead signs enemy

starting early reached coast town afternoon 
received great joy inhabitants state abject terror 
runner bearer message rajah headman left morning harry party started returned news found headless bodies escort seen traces white man followers doubtless carried enemy 
news caused terrible consternation thought town might attacked moment 
inhabitants possessed canoes took paddled away coast 
others fled mountains 
finding however scouts left four days passed without appearance enemy returned evening harry arrived 
hearing escort defeat invaders enormous loss lively joy manifested harry treated almost reverential respect men escort agreeing solely due victory gained 
made however short stay village headman ordered largest canoe prepared 
decorated flowers flags manned twenty rowers soon harry two companions took seats rowed brig 
welcome back lindsay fairclough shouted canoe approached could hardly believe eyes saw come canoe 
terrible fright 
natives brought news escort sent take johore every one killed signs party certain carried 
sent boat ashore every morning armed teeth reported place almost entirely deserted two three men left said news whatever received 
time harry gained deck 
escort fairclough asked 
sorry say murdered 
however story long one although rajah sent food escort gave desperately thirsty tell happened wetted whistle 
fairclough told hardy come harry story told full sundry cups tea harry preferred stronger beverages 
adventure indeed fairclough said harry brought story end 
would given anything siege 
cared prisoner fellow camp especially disarmed could even make fight 
affair leopard would taste though place nothing knife abdool doubt whether come well business splendid malays rajah must fought well indeed beat force six times strength 
great point obtained ratification tumangong grant whenever may made 
satisfactory course would mind anything like importance series adventures something think life 
wish crew backed though afraid would shared fate malay escort sudden attack forest 
yes pluck could scarcely repulsed sudden onslaught though certainly killing would one side 
glad indeed abdool also came safely missed fearfully 
interpreter showed good man hope lord mornington report conduct make handsome present 
got away hardly likely ever found way johore done could explained rajah going attacked got erect stockade main cause success 
fact would probably anger slaughter escort ordered executed spot 
take either loss presents greatly heart 
saved kingdom doubt 
likely would ever ventured defend confidence felt steps took 
told would taken flight case kingdom would lost sooner later hunted 
suppose start soon like certainly sooner better 
shall glad back saying going 
assuredly friendship mahrattas relied upon 
know likely make fresh move except self defense mysore completely pacified firm government established 
still never saying happen 
thick mahratta business along like 
well get anchor daybreak tomorrow 
board glad news sail calcutta next morning circulated ship

establishment started southern part island two years later moved harbor northwest side bay 
called port cornwallis abandoned found terribly unhealthy 
pity afforded good shelter northeast monsoon blowing partially southwest monsoon 
doubt could made healthy country round well cleared found sufficient utility warrant large outlay natives bitterly unfriendly would require garrison two three hundred men overawe 
always losing life open attacks perhaps habit crawling shooting men arrows 
week later seventy eighty miles west andaman group 
directly brig weathered northernmost point sumatra course laid west avoid dangerous inside passage 
harry went deck morning found wind dropped altogether 
end monsoon fairclough said 
going shorten sail 
saying way wind come 
glass falling fast course expected

working sailors busy taking sail getting upper spars 
ready worst opened passage escape felt fairly confident although might meet many dangers good chance getting safely away 
danger signals lindsay captain said pale light suddenly shone 
looking harry saw ball fire main mast head 
presently seemed roll mast till reached top sail yard broke two rolled remained stationary one end yard 
harry never seen phenomenon

mr hardy captain said lieutenant standing near go cabin see glass stands harry hear answer hardy returned fairclough said gone another quarter inch since looked half hour ago low ever seen 
mr hardy better send men aloft furl main top sail altogether run fore stay sail

lightning flashing overhead incessantly although thunder occasionally heard howl storm 
sea broken irregular leaping masses bulwarks sweeping decks

pannikin hot soup served men would last hot refreshment would obtain gale broke hatchways battened impossible keep fire alight 
best thing turn lindsay fairclough said former finished soup task slight difficulty circumstances 
good remaining 
long likely last probably two three days possibly longer 
take advice harry said 
shall glad get wet clothes

however completely worn buffeting gale efforts required hold excitement fire storm long dropped sleep wake ray dim light showed morning breaking 
motion ship unabated great difficulty getting clothes went deck

mr eden better come us 
coffee ready cabin 
possibility sitting table 
sitting floor leeward holding mug one hand biscuit managed difficulty dispose meal 
fairclough putting dry clothes threw bunk 
midshipman retired cabin harry went deck 
heading mr hardy shouted joined lieutenant 
present moment running nearly due east round compass several times since gale struck us means saying anything like certainty position 
talking captain went agreed center hurricane undoubtedly moving northeast must gone good many miles direction 
course means determining far till get glimpse sun doubt gale continues shall soon perilous position must driving towards andamans 
may luck pass north go 
tried last night get little sail would stand obliged take 
nothing hope best 
two hours later fairclough came 
afraid sleep harry said 

better rest sleep question 
heading mr hardy northeast sir 
fairclough took telescope rack companion slinging shoulder mounted ratlines top 
made anything asked sailor stationed 
thought twice sir saw land ahead could say certain 
thick clouds open bit one chance 
although taken glass fairclough attempt use present stood gazing fixedly ahead 
quarter hour later sudden rift clouds low shore visible five six miles ahead dark mass much farther rising cloud 
fairclough instantly unslung telescope adjusted 
minute afterwards clouds closed telling man keep sharp lookout descended deck 
must set main top sail close reefed course 
running straight land unless much mistaken great andaman 
lofty hill distance back shore 
caught glimpse lower part none small islands hill speak 
shore six miles peak lies center island hundred forty miles long seventy miles northern point 
know means 
however must keep 
ay ay sir hardy said turning without another word gave orders men set top sail 
done ship course laid parallel shore 
wind nearly northwest lay water several planks deck 
crew lashed windward clustering would danger mast go 
fairclough stood minute looking shivering mast shrouds stretched like iron bars 
must get guns overboard mr hardy never stand indeed waves striking broadside falling cascade 
calling four men hardy made way lee scuppers water nearly waists opened portholes slacked lashings four guns disappeared overboard 
required much greater pains get guns port side tackle attached could lowered carefully one one across deck worked heartily also launched overboard 
eased bit fairclough said hardy rejoined 
helped pin could almost feel difference gun went overboard 
afraid make difference long run hardy said 
must making great deal leeway say shore couple hours latest 
still may time look soft spot 
much chance case hardy hope another shift wind 
go round north sir sha n able lie course 
gone round point since got top sail 
quite doubt whether go round soon enough save us 
go round little north must try get tack afraid sea go 
course great aim reach port cornwallis get far look chart see three narrow straits 
much water know 
vaguely marked chart 
one thirty miles north present position find make northern point shall try get 
sure case would best plan water enough run mile passage shall ground comparatively still water whereas wind blowing every quarter almost certain tremendous sea open port 
fairclough placed wheel told two midshipmen go round tell crew inlet ahead depth water uncertain 
approached hands would come aft avoid crushed falling masts 
dozen men take hatchets cut away wreckage mast fell leaving couple shrouds uncut 
done directly vessel began break could swim make way shrouds floating mast 
could swim could make shore 
left ship mr hardy cut shrouds masts probably ground ere long 
sailors part gazing coast little doubt bodies would soon cast became lively active soon received order 
seemed chance 
four hours passed 
wind far headed brig could longer keep course parallel shore 
twice endeavored put time failed making much leeway coast less three miles away 
tremendous sea breaking upon 
one midshipmen past hour foretop glass captain went took place beside 
saw accustomed use telescope rough weather would useless motion great following midshipman example lashing mast could retain footing 
sure seen break surf mr eden quite sure sir 
ought far rightly marked chart 
another hour passed within mile half shore 
think see break sir midshipman pointed spot mile along coast 
pray god may fairclough said chance 
two three minutes later said right certainly break 
line surf run shore everywhere else 
descended deck 
thank god said joined mr hardy harry seeing coming made way shrouds break surf 
complete break certainly inlet sort
