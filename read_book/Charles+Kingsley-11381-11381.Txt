sermon ii 
salvation john xvii 

life eternal may know thee true god jesus christ thou hast sent 
explain text church catechism must say little means 
asked salvation would probably answer eternal life 
would answer rightly 
exactly salvation neither less 
nothing greater belong created 
less god love mercy eternal without bound 
eternal life answer going heaven die 
die know tell let us listen god says 
let us listen lord jesus christ word god says 
let us listen spake man never spake says 
surely words must clearest simplest exact deepest widest exactly fit true words complete words perfect words improved adding taking away one jot tittle 
lord jesus christ say eternal life eternal life may know thee true god jesus christ thou hast sent 
know god jesus christ eternal life 
eternal life us ever friends 
unless lord words complete perfect tell us truth whole truth nothing truth eternal life eternal life one ever must make minds content therewith 
answer almost angrily course 
way obtain eternal life know god jesus christ obtain 
words friends rash words men thrust scripture carnal conceits could improve upon speech son man says know god way eternal life rather eternal life way know god 
say know god jesus christ order may eternal life 
whatever says say 
nay exact exact lord words says eternal life order may know god jesus christ 
know god may obtain eternal life must eternal life order may know god eternal life means knowledge god end purpose eternal life given us 
however may least says noble collect repeat every sunday says eternal life stands knowledge god depends fall without 
may know god 
merely may know doctrines salvation ways winning god favor turning away vengeance merely know god done ages ago may ages hence us know god know person likeness character always know righteousness goodness truth love mercy strength willingness mightiness save word bible calls glory therefore admire delight utterly 
eternal life stands god given us eternal life son may know 
oh believe saviour simply like little children enter joy lord 
acquaint god peace 
know god also know jesus christ sent 
st john tells us god already given us eternal life says also life son 
know son god father well pleased perfect son exact likeness likeness glory express image person character described one whose life ever eternally love mercy self sacrifice labor lost sinful men trust obedience father 
know life come receive eternal life world give us take away us neither man devil angel death bodies ruin empires destruction whole universe time space things whereof man conceive dream alter slightest life goodness righteousness love eternal god spring eternal christ yesterday day ever nothing sinful wills rob us 
eternal life therefore salvation 
different account though bible account narrow paltry one many minds days narrow paltry notion means saved punishment sins die unbelieving godless atheistical notion like unbelief hurts spoils men lives 
many say god must save dead course one else long alive must save 
god must save hell must save poverty trouble world may say offend 
salvation seems altogether next life people lose entirely belief god deliverer protector guide friend life really think get better world knowing god jesus christ set work help cunning covetousness cowardly truckling wicked ways world renounced baptism following multitude evil standing saying saw see wrong cruelty done upon earth afraid fight god battles like men god say dangerous 
evil days thousands call christians live worldly selfish without god world talk busily enough preparing meet god world come dreaming poor souls arriving call salvation die often fear deep enough scripture calls damnation die 
say salvation going place called heaven friends let bible speak 
tells us salvation place person living moving acting person none lord jesus christ

merely pleasant place dies day long safe merely dies every chance change mortal life 
friends ashamed put christian men mind things 
truly evil communications corrupted good manners awake righteousness sin knowledge god 
ashamed say old hymns mouths every one day testify want faith say christ life christ salvation written doubt men meant literally said whatever sing days may mean 
hymns mean words mean anything surely preaching seems fear strange new doctrine

one word child taught happen death except body rise christ judge dead well alive one word salvation dead almost thing one hears many pulpits 
catechism teaches child believe jesus christ salvation life believes enough know christ eternal salvation must eternal also 
christ life child eternal life must child christ life must eternal even christ enough child us also

sermon iv 
names matthew 
thou shall call name jesus 
ever seem curious thing catechism begins asking child name name gave name think accustomed church catechism childhood would seem strange way beginning teach child religion 
consider sure right way begin teaching child catechism wishes teach 
fancy begins asking child name must begin somehow go religion afterwards 
fancy merely supposes clergyman know child name must ask catechism intended taught parents children masters apprentices servants people therefore know child name perfectly well already yet begin asking child name 
child name faith duty christian may answer christian name given baptized 
christian name given baptized rather time old custom church 
doubt wise blessed custom one shows us much god man churchmen old times knew religious teachers days 
old custom arise put minds church people last sixteen hundred years least baptized named anything men names long lord jesus came long baptism heard earth heathens old names heathens names still church people feel right mix new thing like baptism world old thing like giving name friends feel say honestly matter understand little understand could explain fully one sermon many either 
let enough day 
god grant may able make understand 
one name name christian name rightly call signifies person character responsibility calling duty given god one word immortal soul alone must answer receive rewards deeds body whether good evil 
names given random without cause meaning 
adam named beasts read whatsoever called beast name 
names gave described beast taken something appearance ways habits right name name expressed nature 
learned men discover animals plants foreign countries give names random take care invent names may describe natures make people understand like adam beasts old 
much old times names men meaning 
reasonable give names full meaning kind dumb animal mere things persons much man separately man person man character different others calling different others therefore ought name separate others therefore old times custom give child separate name meaning description child something particular child 
may see adorable name jesus 
name others ought show us name means name son man one perfect sinless man pattern men therefore must perfect name pattern names given lord man god born conceived womb blessed virgin 
therefore must show mean merely outward accident something seemed looked like men eyes name jesus must mean lord sight father heaven eternal purpose god father really absolutely must mean declare substance 
indeed adorable name jesus means nothing else god saviour god saves 
name ever 
name fulfilled earth proved character exact description name short made different beings heaven earth create uncreate therefore bears name eternity mark ever god saviour perfect name pattern names men 
though christian names give children england especial meaning nothing expect wish children grow yet names people countries world 
jewish names find bible almost meaning 
simeon believe means obedient jehoshaphat means lord judge daniel god judge isaiah means salvation lord isaac means laughs memorial sarah laughing heard child ishmael means lord hears remembrance god hearing hagar cry wilderness ishmael dying thirst 
especially names read god commanded given meanings tell persons bore names god expected would 
abraham means father many nations 
children isaiah hosea names given god meaning something god going nation jews 
john means given lord name given john baptist angel strange birth mother old age 
must remember heathens also gave names children though know children owed duty god belonged god therefore call names christian names 
yes heathens give children names give children names still 
something sad painful heathen names yet full meaning 
solemn lesson us show us fall means man becomes gives way fallen nature parted christ head man 
first heathens dim remembrance man made likeness god lived faith god therefore men names express indeed many old names 
alas likeness god fallen man like tree without roots rather tree without soil grow 
god likeness man flourish long joined christ perfect likeness god true life true light men foundation already laid soil man meant grow flourish ever long fed spirit god lord giver life proceeds never forget lose understanding god man proceeds god father also god son lord jesus christ 
therefore heathen god likeness withered decayed tree withers decays torn soil 
first began call names false gods invented carnal fancies 
called names dumb animal pharaoh means sun god ammonites mean people worshipped ram god potiphar means fat bull egyptians used worship could tell hundreds heathen names like ridiculous enough make one smile keep mind tokens sin ignorance likeness god beasts perish 
comes another set names showing lower fall still heathens quite forgotten man originally made god likeness content live likeness beasts perish pride like beasts therefore name children dumb animals girls gentler fairer animals boys ravenous cruel beasts prey 
custom among many heathen nations perhaps among almost time 
custom among red indians north america find one man tribe called bull another panther another serpent showing would like could strong bull cruel panther venomous serpent 
wonder red indians put likeness beasts dying face earth like beasts admire imitate way heathen forefathers blessed gospel preached 
frightful reading old histories find many englishmen forefathers named fierce wild beasts tried alas like names children wrath whose feet swift shed blood whose lips poison adders destruction bloodshed following paths knowing way peace 
wolf common wild beast england say twenty common old english names ending wolf besides many ending bear eagle raven 
fearful sign men flesh blood gloried like wolf cruellest greediest mean savage beasts shall thank god enough sent knowledge son jesus christ called new men christ jesus called holy baptism receive new names begin new lives righteous likeness god nature children wrath baptism might become children grace forefathers inherited corrupt nature original sin likeness foul ravenous beasts perish might power spirit god become sons god conformed likeness jesus christ peace love righteousness holiness 
yet names lower depth still among fallen heathen men lose utterly last dim notion god intends men persons even god father person god son person god holy spirit person lose custom giving children personal names either giving grow mere nicknames taken peculiarity bodies something done place happen live else like many tribes heathen negroes name day week born way knowing apart last shocking give names names knowing apart dumb animals sight 
conceive deeper fall utter brutishness yet savage tribes africa indian islands said god help live way names blotted indeed book life right state men wrong state 
disease men fallen disease christ came raise men raise us holy baptism 
baptism puts child right state right state human human soul human person 
baptism declares right state member christ child god inheritor kingdom heaven 
member christ therefore person christ person 
child god therefore person child duty love trust obey father person animal thing 
inheritor kingdom heaven therefore bound cherish heavenly thoughts feelings righteousness love obedience spirits persons animals things feel 
see baptism proper time giving child name christ claims child name shows child person soul conscience duty person must answer alone body whether good evil 
soul conscience given child christ things made light lights every man comes world 
thus holy baptism god adopts child jesus christ 
declares child regenerate new life life seed eternal personal life nature 
seed eternal life none holy spirit god spirit father son lord giver life verily indeed regenerate child holy baptism dwells soul person self may educate child character raise affections subdue raise daily death sin life righteousness 
therefore catechism solemnly ask child name ask light question 
speak spirit person spirit self god wills never perish live ever 
single child schoolfellows millions human beings ever lived ever live make child answering name confess person immortal soul must stand alone judgment seat god person duty calling upon god earth must fulfil pay forfeit 
ask child gave name make declare name given baptism wherein made member christ child god 
make child confess person jesus christ christ redeemed self taken made merely god creature god slave god child 
make child confess duty person towards likes follow carnal lusts toward god toward neighbors god kingdom heaven well 
go rest catechism teach person speaking may live ever ever person faith persons beside even god father son holy spirit teach creed duty persons beside even god man teach ten commandments diligent prayer another person beside even god heavenly father feed strengthen day day eternal life given baptism 
thus whole catechism turns upon first question thy name explains child really meant sight god lord jesus christ whole church earth heaven child name person name given holy baptism 
true children friends equally true us 
persons persons christ stands alone day night judgment seat christ 
must answer 
none deliver brother make agreement unto god 
us calling heavenly father duty none instead

sermon xi 
ahab naboth kings xxi 

ahab spake unto naboth saying give thy vineyard may garden herbs near unto house give thee better vineyard seem good thee give thee worth money 
naboth said unto ahab lord forbid give inheritance fathers unto thee 
heard day read first lesson story naboth king ahab 
know well 
naboth vineyard passed proverb something covet 
good 
know bible well bible words bible thoughts much worked ways talking thinking everyday matters 
far see best days england best days every christian country ever read days men ashamed bibles ready live bibles ask advice bibles buying selling making war peace business life ashamed quote texts scripture parliament market battle field god law god rule god word matter hand therefore sure right word right rule 
people grown ashamed days alter matter one jot 
may deny god deny 
laws everlasting ruling judging us day long much ruled judged jews old 
god abraham god god moses god god ahab naboth god neither government altered least since time never alter ever ever ever choose believe life shall made believe ugly painful schooling life come 
laws god learn story first may learn sacred thing property 
man possessions justly come belong sight god well sight man god uphold avenge man right 
naboth see stands simply right property 
lord forbid give inheritance fathers unto thee 
think meant god actually forbidden seems sort oath used 
may certainly reasons thinking wrong part lands hurtful perhaps family 
yet ahab promised better vineyard worth money help thinking naboth reason one shows face words 
inheritance fathers vineyard 
worked generation generation perhaps according jewish custom buried somewhere least worked played perhaps since child loved part parcel father house sacred spot 

holy feeling makes man cling bit land inherited parents even cottage though hired one lived many year planted tilled perhaps loved dead gone grown gone world till little old cottage garden full remembrances past joys past sorrows 
feeling makes man cling home land good feeling breeds good man 
makes respect keeps reckless unsettled 
feeling broken 
seldom pleasant see land change hands seldom pleasant see people turned cottages 
must often let seldom possible 
one likes see family take root place grow thrive one generation another find friends families take root thrive place proportion fear god righteousness 
psalms tell way abide land prosper trust lord good wicked soon rooted names perish land 
one sees come true daily 
return naboth 
loved land therefore right keep 
may say fancy could better vineyard worth money 
remember least god respected fancy justified avenged 
naboth death elijah accused ahab god name put two counts indictment ahab committed two sins 
hast thou killed also taken possession killing one sin taking possession another 
ahab learned two weighty bitter lessons 
learned god law stands ever though man law broken forgotten disuse 
must understand jews free people even 
like nations round russians slaves king holding property 
law moses made free people held property man god god law said thou shalt steal 
thou shalt covet 
cursed removes neighbor landmark 
kings bound govern moses law kings rulers bound govern old constitutions england equal justice rich poor 
wicked kings israel trying break law make tyrants despots czar russia 
first jeroboam began trying wean people moses law preventing going worship jerusalem making worship instead golden calves dan bethel 
knew could make idolaters soon make slaves succeeded kingdom israel grew miserable year year ahab wicked successor breaking laws property wrongfully taking away subjects lands 
perhaps said heart king law stronger right like 
found mistaken 
found though forgot moses law god law stood still founded eternal justice proceeds ever mouth god law chosen forget judged law god deals equal justice rich poor like god acceptor persons says thou shalt covet king upon throne sternly beggar dunghill 
law stands still friends doubt 
thanks wisdom justice forefathers built laws england old ten commandments hang sign thereof every church day 
thanks say god root law england equal justice man man high low thing bless god every day lives poor man little safe rich man wealth many sin oppression many sin covetousness friends law man touch 
make laws artfully bad men always slip escape spirit obey letter suppose world end let laws perfect may man wishes cheat oppress neighbor surely able work wicked way 
well friends man law weak god man law flaws gaps covetousness creep god none even god forbid man law died sinners left sin without fear punishment still god law stands sure eye living god slumbers hand living god never grows weary everlasting heaven voice saying day night ever endure ever 
sit throne judging right sceptre righteousness sceptre kingdom 
judge world justice minister true judgment unto people 
also refuge oppressed even refuge due time trouble 
hear words friends hear obey love life wish see good days never never say thing right simply law punish 
never say hearts tempted hard cruel covetous reaching harm break law 
law whether see break law whether confess law wall iron clothed thunder though man law flimsy net thread law acts parliament shall judge day secrets hearts shall disclosed every man shall receive due reward deeds done body according allowed statute book according good evil 
another lesson may learn story give way passions give way devil also 
ahab gave way passion knew wrong naboth refused sell vineyard dare openly rob went house heavy heart fretted like spoilt child could get wanted 
little thing might content go without 
king israel one small vineyard less prosperity spoilt must needs every toy set heart weak enough fret could get much already 
knew could get king naboth property god everlasting law stood thing coveted 
well contented fretting 
friends rich poor take heed words whenever man gives way selfishness self seeking proud covetous envious peevish temper devil sure glide whisper ear thoughts make worse worse ay ever dreamt 
first comes flesh devil flesh opens door heart devil steps quickly enough 
first comes flesh fleshly carnal pride thwarted fleshly carnal longing thing longs one fleshly carnal peevishness ill temper pleasant thing one happens like 
state mind bird call devils see man temper flock believe crows carrion 
astonishing humbling awful friends horrible thoughts cross one mind one gives way selfish proud angry longing temper thoughts ashamed next moment temptations sin shudder seem unlike parts 
dark fit past one hardly believe wicked thoughts ever crossed one mind 
think part believe whispers devil pass away believe lord jesus christ drives away 
man gives way determines keep sullenness gives place devil thoughts pass take hold man possess bible calls make madness things alas done things day repented life things would gladly cut right hand sake able say never thing done done eternity given place devil devil made five minutes work could undo five thousand years left comes cast god boundless mercy christ boundless atonement cry sins like scarlet thou alone canst make whiter snow sin ever let ever thee god punish thou seest fit oh forgive mercy thee infinite redemption thanks god great love cry vain 
yet oh friends give place devil unless wish forgiven repent latest day live 
ahab fate 
knew say wrong knew naboth property dare openly rob went house heavy heart refused eat temper devil lost time sending evil spirit 
woman sent jezebel ahab wife far see woman devilish spirit cruel proud profligate unjust well worshipper filthy idols canaanites 
ahab first sin married wicked heathen woman sin punished tempted pride self conceit taunted sin dost thou govern kingdom israel give thee vineyard naboth 
remember falsely accusing naboth blasphemy 
ahab seems taken part naboth murder 
perhaps afraid weak man jezebel strong fierce spirit ruled led matter making worship idols content led 
content let others wickedness courage carry 
forgot well said thing another let others sin sin 
would god friends would remember often people wink wrong dealings employ servants children convenient 
shut eyes hearts say events mine concern answerable people sins 
would thing certainly done may well make best

world times seems full every one friends hushes cruel dishonest matter gainer better receiver stolen goods find day lord sin lie door jezebel sin lay ahab need ahab say jezebel prophet even give time excuse thus saith lord hast thou killed also taken possession taking possession naboth vineyard profiting murder made partaker murder hear terrible sentence place dogs licked blood naboth dogs shall lick thy blood even thine 
oh friends whatsoever keep clean hands pure heart 
touch pitch surely stick 
let gain tempt partaker others men sins never fancy men lay blame right person god 
god surely lay burden man helped make burden god surely require part payment man profited bargain keep clear men sins may clear also condemnation 
ahab committed horrible great sin received sentence said nothing done repent fashion 
ahab seems utterly bad man weak man fond pleasure slave passions easily led sometimes good generally evil 
god execute full vengeance repentance poor one enough good merciful god gave credit far went promised worst part sentence ruin family come time 
still sentence stood fulfilled 
long read second lesson killed battle bravely honor would slight punishment friends shamefully chance shot disguised cowardice guilty conscience tried throw danger ally good king jehoshaphat judah washed chariot pool samaria dogs licked blood according word lord spake elijah prophet 
ends one clear terrible stories whole bible god impartial justice 
may god give us grace lay heart tempted ahab rich poor temptation alike give place devil let lead us dark deep sin giving way fancies longings pride temper 
tempted ahab reach neighbors way mean always cheating unfair caring thinking first last trying make comfortable feed pride expense 
oh friends whenever tempted selfish grasping sure opening door devil hell though may look smooth gentle respectable perhaps shall know comes us shall take counsels counsel angel light 
sure selfishness opened door heart god devil come let disguise cunningly hope flee selfishness lord jesus christ came father glorify father save life sacrifice freely us selfish weak greedy wandering sheep

fallen heart man apt say friends pride narrowness cries pope rome sets pope stead 
surely another better way deploring differences say oneself sorry bitterly sorry christians differ without quarrelling hating one another 
comes deeper home thought much sorry differ fellow christians without growing angry suspecting despising treating fellow christians 
yes friends first think religious controversies examine hearts deeds words see whether making bitterness bitter old proverb says stirring fire sword repent humbly utterly every harsh word hasty judgment ungenerous suspicion sins men god father lights worketh children good pleasure 
say give believe right true 
god forbid try friends really believe even try trying make dishonest 
hold good man differs god surely lay one law another right wrong 

surely mean quite right perfect infallible mean right whole far see 
tell right whole far sees answer right yes true thing black white also 
friends friends religious controversy two sides whereof clearly opposite yes black white know none hardly found one records protestant church since first luther reformers protested romish idolatry 
last matter doubt long first two commandments stand decalogue exception would difficult find dispute truth lay altogether one party 
truth rather lies general much halfway two combatants third place neither sees perhaps god intend see life leaves servants work one side christian truth dividing every man severally according powers mind needs situation 
true infallible rule scripture interpretations sure infallible inspired infinite inexhaustible pretend fathomed abysses comprehended boundless treasures pretence folly 
true contains things necessary salvation plainly set forth runs may read wayfaring man though poor shall err therein 
yet contain things whereof even st paul said knew part prophesied part saw glass darkly suppose among truths necessary salvation points still dispute number belong simple fundamental truths gospel 
plain matters wayfaring man though poor make mind 
one laid directly scripture like ten commandments lord prayer creeds 
every one seems whether right wrong abstruse deductions delicate theories built single obscure texts 
surely necessary salvation lord would spoken tone words mistake thunders sinai tables stone fresh finger mark god

hear language really good men confess puzzled 
doubt reasons seem sound conceive

believe apostles creed surely think meaning one word holy spirit 
attribute man good deeds except holy spirit dare say innate natural virtue would fall pelagian heresy neither dare attribute good deeds evil spirit say however good may look must bad belongs denomination god spirit 
dare would approach fearfully near unpardonable sin sin holy ghost bigotry says casteth devils prince devils 
surely christians churchmen confess bible prayer book declare every good deed man comes one fountain good god father lights inspiration holy spirit
