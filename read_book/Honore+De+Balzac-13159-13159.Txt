matter fact joins much splendeurs et miseres des courtisanes actual companions 
fact instance somewhat haphazard arbitrary way actual division comedie worked dealing wholly solely parisian life put scenes de la vie de province separated natural conclusion merely matter volumes matter divisions 
making arrangement however necessary remember balzac scheme especially connection three parts ways close permit wrenching asunder altogether finally 
caution given necessary done devoting first part introduction entirely first third angouleme parts consecrating latter part egregious lucien 
double gain independently connection referred lucien little except opportunity display virtue sister david sechard parts appear among interesting balzac work 
idyllic charm marriage love combined exhibitions author power one ways loved best show never escaped attention balzac competent critics

rest society madame de bargeton inferior 
real interest les deux poetes still eve et david two always remembered comes distinguished provincial lies characters gave name last part 
david man one idea yet room honest love deserved friendship balzac could go wrong 
david sechard takes place among sheep comedie 
may indeed say phrase unfortunate balzac sheep qualities mutton innocence 
quite denied 
david far indeed good imbecile like cesar birotteau man intoxicated common sense passion respectable like goriot 
sacrifice mania time something nay much disinterested devotion brother law quite pass limits sense 
shall say eve good course good gold eugenie grandet novelist kind enough allow happier 
quite interested us love david even persuaded us love existed form deserving name eve rather take husband protect look either love honor obey orthodox sense love love sake still take husbands wives even end nineteenth century question reader must answer likely refuse assent sentence happy husband wife eve chardon central part illusions perdues reason stands may ostensibly considerably less introduction explanatory balzac often gives books one carefully worked diversely important novels 
course read splendeurs et miseres des courtisanes avowedly second part small piece eve et david serving link 
almost sufficient 
lucien de rubempre ou le journalisme would straightforward descriptive title one balzac moods would content enough use 
story continuous interesting need elaborate argument nobody likely miss important link 
balzac nowhere excelled finesse success analysis double disillusion introduces madame de bargeton lucien makes redintegratio amoris valid kind impossible aware anticipated rupture 
perhaps matter general agreement whether exceeded fair license novelist attributing lucien charms body gifts mind make till moral weakness worthlessness exposed irresistible enable time repair faults sort fairy good luck 
sonnets les marguerites given author poetical friends gautier said supplied tulip undoubtedly good sufficient 
lucien first article according practice rashness much deprecated given likewise certainly wonderful paris press must rather low ebb made sensation 
favored actual portrait lucien detection less possible novelist perhaps little abused privilege making hero like paris handsome like hector brave rather like paris handsome like phoebus clever 
doubt however interest book lies partly vivid severe picture journalism given partly way character lucien adjusted show abstract journalist still farther 
far picture true must said fairness balzac good many persons competence france pronounced truth one say much worse french journalists 
also certain lesser still inconsiderable number persons england generally persons perhaps balzac genius like balzac published books satisfied reception press agree less england 
say believe things ever quite bad england quite sure never need 
doubt spiteful unprincipled incompetent practitioners journalism everything else course obvious advertisements favor chiefs parties forth temptations newspaper managers hold high standard honor anonymity affords newspaper writers dangerously easy shield cover malice dishonesty 
say long practice every kind political literary journalism never seriously asked write anything think never slightest difficulty confining think 
fact balzac like good many men letters abuse journalism put much court continually practising merely struggling period long made name indeed almost last 
hard resist conclusion charged journalism generally merely envy hatred malice uncharitableness hopeless pervading dishonesty little ground inability conceive one except vile reasons kind could fail praise honore de balzac 
rate either art art assisted strengthened personal feeling seen counted much produced wonderfully vivid piece fiction one think inferior success hardly anything done 
whether late period well informed well affected well equipped critic hinted picture luciens lousteaus little propagate another matter 
seriousness balzac took accusation perhaps shows little sense galling 
putting aside un grand homme de province paris must ranked comedy tragedy scheme execution first rank work 
bibliography long curious book almost one contains verse balzac given poetical friends occupies full ten pages de lovenjoul record 
first part bore general title book beginning appeared scenes de la vie de province
