henry troubled 
sorry seen enemy man bird whose name become evil one border

broad trail found easily also kept sharp watch bird band felt sure would join soon

beneath dry leaves last year raked couches thus every man blanket beneath another care wind blew 
snug bears lairs despite darkness night exceeding improbability anyone finding henry tom ross lay awake watched 
others slept peacefully two sentinels could hear easy breathing feet away 
night henry began grow uneasy 
twice thought heard cries like hoot owl howl wolf far away uncertain 
hoot howl might product imagination 
alive wilderness full meaning mind could create sounds none existed 
whispered tom ross listening hard could heard nothing rustling leaves twigs wind 
henry sure heard product vivid fancy little later sure 
must faint cry wolf heard echo 
keenest ear tom ross hear sound proof 
vivid imagination often means prompt powerful man action henry acted 
tom whispered going scout distance thought sounds came 
wake boys back morning 
tom ross nodded 
believe henry really heard anything would remonstrated knew useless 
merely drew blanket little closer resolved one pair eyes watch well two watched 
henry folded blankets put little pack minute gone 
dark dark one used night could see 
sounds seemed hear came southwest road direction easy grown forest comparatively free undergrowth 
walked swiftly mile heard cry wolf 
last doubt gone mind 
real sound made indian calling indian 
corrected course little went swiftly 
heard cry much nearer another mile saw glow among trees 
went nearer saw detached cones light 
knew camp fire camp fire built boldly region dangerous kentuckian indicated surely indians allies 
believe force timmendiquas could reached spot turning course intended solve doubt 
camp one little prairies numerous old northwest evidently pitched order secure room fires 
henry concluded must large force eagerness know increased 
crept nearer nearer amazed number fires 
much larger band one led timmendiquas 
also heard sound many voices footsteps 
place among trees saw dark figures passing repassing 
also caught metallic glitter something rifle tomahawk could clearly make dark 
formidable force bent upon great errand curiosity intense 
instinct sent upon journey woods wrong mean go away knew purpose army gathered 
lay upon ground thickest shadow woods crept forward little closer 
saw camp contained least five hundred warriors 
nearly could make mostly shawnees probably easterly villages seemed sprinkling delawares miamis 
white men tories canadians english fifty sixty number present also red uniform 
indians war paint sat great groups around fires feasting 
evidently hunters brought plenty game atoning fast 
ate prodigiously buffalo deer bear wild turkey throwing bones behind gnawed clean 
meanwhile sang shawnee tongue wild chant south great warriors go far fair land kaintuckee carry death yengees hands strong hearts fierce none white face escape us 
cross river steal woods night dark hour tomahawk falls burning houses send flames sky scalps yengees hang belts none white face escape us 
henry heart began pump heavily 
little specks danced eyes 
great war party one foreseen one going march kentucky 
evidently enterprise distinct timmendiquas 
eagerness see henry crept nearer nearer utmost verge danger line lying clump bushes warriors passing twenty feet away 
suddenly started little new figure came light thrown distinct relief blazing background fires

henry knew someone importance coming crept along edge forest see 
colonel bird several subordinate officers chiefs gathered front mass warriors stood expectant

great wyandot took held moment dropped touch hateful 
henry noticed timmendiquas never seemed care white allies indians whether english canadian tory

birds feather pleased flock together great forest 
timmendiquas chiefs walked toward larger central fire whither bird men showed way 
pipes lighted smoked high enough rank sit council mass warriors gathered respectful distance 
fires replenished blazed filling camp ruddy light 
henry found meaning metallic gleam seen forest 
near center camp standing row six cannon fine bronze guns large caliber dark muzzles sinister chance pointing toward south 
full knowledge came gloomy truth 
expedition kentucky formidable many yet gone 
carried battery large cannon plenty white gunners man 
wooden palisades new settlements could stand five minutes great guns 
eagerness see hateful cannon henry first time years forgot customary caution 
made bush rustle notice 
scouting indian passed near hear 
scouting indian shawnee alert suspicious heard rustling bush 
dropped crept near saw long figure among bushes 
crept away signaled comrades 
henry straining forward better view cannon sudden sound behind 
drew body quickly together like powerful animal spring could reach feet half dozen warriors hurled upon 
fell impact great weight rifle could use close quarters torn hands 
warriors uttered triumphant shout caused sitting fire spring feet 
henry summit youthful strength 
one forest matched either height muscular strength save possibly timmendiquas tremendous effort rose feet whole yelling pack clinging one arm one leg two shoulders waist 
hurled loose one right arm snatched pistol belt quick flash two others loosing hold elsewhere seized arm 
pressed weight upon seeking throw 
evidently wished take captive 
henry remained erect despite immense weight pulling 
bent slightly forward moments efforts exactly balanced strength six sought pull 
brief space remained immovable 
sweat broke forehead great beads 
effort convulsive gigantic threw standing clear one brief instant 
hand pistol butt yelling pack back quick leaping like wolves 
dragged knees struggled feet drenched perspiration heart beating loudly made mighty efforts 
struggle came free woods open light fires cast red glow tall figure white youth six naked sinewy brown forms tore

others among indians looked admiration upon tall youth made magnificent struggle life liberty 
deep hum ran great circle formed fighters 
excitement joy supreme sport showed upon savage faces 
one two started forward help six timmendiquas waved back 
circle pressed little closer rows dark faces behind peered brown shoulders 
henry scarcely conscious hundreds looked 
pulses temples throat beating heavily mist eyes 
nobody present save six strove pull 
soul swelled fierce anger hurled one another find springing back like rebound rubber ball 
anger increased 
men annoyed terribly 
bathed perspiration nearly clothing torn body still fought opponents 
ring come closer closer savages uttered low cries admiration sent one antagonists spinning 
admired massive figure powerful neck white shoulders bare great muscles bunched put forth supreme efforts 
verily man said old chief yellow panther 
timmendiquas nodded never took absorbed eyes contest 
uttered low cry henry suddenly caught one warriors fist sent like shot earth

hurling far turned faced wyandot chief said timmendiquas surrender 
chapter viii northward march great wyandot chief inclined head slightly received pistol hatchet knife henry drew belt

truly great warrior 
never seen fight made strength one six one triumphant 
murmur approval warriors followed words 
like old greeks indians admired size symmetry strength qualities necessary daily lives henry stood wet perspiration breathing heavily exemplified considered best man 
savage warriors intention sparing 
would burned stake delight equal delight would praised never uttered groan would another proof greatness 
braxton wyatt pressed nearer 
joy evil heart capture enemy unalloyed 
knew friendship timmendiquas bore henry feared prisoner might escape usual fate captives 
part prevent disaster thought already method 
dreaded power timmendiquas bold proposed dare nevertheless 
take prisoner south said colonel bird 
surrendered timmendiquas said henry 
camp colonel bird said wyatt mild tone could assume course anyone taken prisoner 
true said simon girty whose influence great among indians particularly shawnees 
timmendiquas said word henry 
saw appeal pride bird pulled mustache ugly face grew uglier 
yes said last 
prisoner mine since taken camp 
timmendiquas spoke quietly underlying every word menace wyatt girty bird alike felt heeded 
prisoner surrendered said 
wyandot warriors helped capture bruises prove 
colonel bird even marches south kaintuckee need prisoners 
words wyatt nothing 
girty become one chiefs judge case 
council finished timmendiquas resumes march detroit ware goes captive prize warriors 
fierce eyes roamed around circle challenging one one opposed 
braxton wyatt eyes dropped fear soul 
renegade enemy people could afford lose favor indians 
girty also evaded 
full craft part policy quarrel timmendiquas 
bird alone disposed accept gage 
intolerable colonel british army spoken manner indian 
wrinkled ugly hare lip said stubbornly prisoner taken camp mine 
girty said low ear let timmendiquas 
well alienate wyandots 
need attack kentucky already dissatisfied heavy losses 
nothing king without indians 
bird without suppleness 
spoke timmendiquas continuing former words give claim white lightning wyandots 
take prisoner choose 
timmendiquas smiled slightly 
understood perfectly 
braxton wyatt retired almost sick rage 
timmendiquas motioned two warriors bound henry arms securely though painfully led away one smaller fires 
sat guards adjusted torn attire annoy waited council went 
glow physical triumph passed henry felt deep depression 
seemed could never forgive much depended upon 
full knowledge expedition marching southward could send warning 
returned comrades news might solved problem dividing force 
two could hurried kentucky ahead bird army three might gone detroit watch preparations made 
condemned say think personal danger 
thought instead might saved would probably fall beneath indian tomahawk one warn 
permitted none chagrin grief show face 
would allow indian renegade see despair anything bordering upon 
merely sat motionless staring fire face without expression 
henry escaped wyandots 
perhaps feat could repeated second time indeed chances spite everything courage came back 
far much strength vitality youth remain despair gradually new resolutions formed almost unconsciously mind 
circumstances fate would present least bare chance one wished courage gradually became confidence 
henry remembering nothing could present lay side fire 
altogether assumed manner impress guard really tired nerves relaxing believed could go sleep 
closed eyes although opened lids heavier every successive opening 
saw camp dimly dark figures warriors becoming shadowy murmur voices sinking whisper could scarcely heard spite bound arms precarious future slept 
henry two guards wyandots regarded admiration slept peacefully low firelight flickering across tanned face 
great body also great mind whatever torture chief timmendiquas intended would endure magnificently 
braxton wyatt simon girty also came look whispered 
would better made end fight capture said wyatt 
true said girty thoughtfully 
long alive dangerous 
timmendiquas tie tight possibility escape friends cause remember braxton 
wish tied said wyatt venomously 
girty laughed softly 
show right spirit braxton said 
live among indians fight one white race one must hate well 
need flush man 
found older business experienced 
wyatt choked words leaping lips presently girty rejoined white men camped around bird commander 
neither felt like sleeping little went look cannon six fine guns row constituting together formidable weapon ever brought western forest 
looked spirit wyatt girty sprang high 
exulted prospect victory 
kentucky sharpshooters behind light palisades able hitherto defeat number indians 
big guns twelve pound cannon balls would sweep palisades like hurricane among saplings 
zeal like convert hate like renegade foresaw easy capture settlement settlement bird numerous irresistible army 
henry meanwhile slept without dreams 
splendid tribute nerves could 
awoke sun hour horizon camp active preparations bird army resume march southward 
timmendiquas stood beside order one wyandot guards cut thongs bound arms 
henry stretched wrists rubbed one impeded circulation restored 
uttered thanks chief 
grateful timmendiquas said insisting last night prisoner go detroit 
seen renegades girty wyatt love whatever may receive hands bad would incited warriors remained power bird 
neither care girty wyatt said timmendiquas smiled slightly help us need allies get 
permit lodges 
may tell debated last night whether go south bird continue detroit 
go detroit 
care company said henry glad going kentucky 
also tell ware continued timmendiquas parties sent last night search comrades four always 
henry moved little looked inquiringly timmendiquas 
chief face expressed nothing 
find said 
replied 
friends ware wary proud taken leader 
food eat march 
brought abundance good food fresh water gourd ate drank heartily 
morning become clear crisp came freshness courage belong youth 
time everything certainly nothing would done reached detroit 
moreover four comrades would discover return would follow 
even one helpless must never despair friends free near hand 
eaten hands bound 
made resistance knowing indian code right ask anything timmendiquas began march northward center wyandot force 
time bird army resumed southern advance 
henry heard twigs dead boughs cracking wheels cannon sound menacing one forget long time 
looked back savage army disappeared amazing quickness forest 
marched day without interruption eating food marched 
timmendiquas head column speak henry 
renegades probably fearing wrath chief also kept away 
country hilly hitherto became level frequently swampy 
traveling difficult 
often feet sank soft mud ankles briars reached scratched damp solitudes air dark heavy 
yet indians went without complaint henry despite bound arms could keep balance pace rest stride stride 
marched several days nights without interruption comparatively level country still swampy times thickly grown forest many streams little lakes 
lakes dotted wild fowl often saw deer shallow portions 
two three deer shot indians devoted little time hunting game well provided food 
henry understood wyandot shawnee gathered talk last drawing near detroit great northwestern fort british indians 
would arrive morrow spent last night camp fires indians relaxing greatly usual taciturnity caution eating banquet 
henry sat log middle camp 
arms unbound could eat others much chose 
since burn torture otherwise would treat well present 
warriors shawnees miamis wyandots 
took good care prisoner chance escape 
might overthrow two three even four five score would 
henry knew well bore member band captive 
part policy appear cheerful contented 
indian surpass careless apparent indifference night felt gloomier time since moments immediately followed capture 
relied upon faithful four days passed without sign 
chance course rescue 
expected expected sign 
skillful masters wilderness knowledge accidents might happen one happened might fallen hands band 
waiting hard test henry mind despite began imagine dire things 
suppose never see comrades 
thousand mischances could befall neighborhood detroit dangerous part indian country 
besides villages pitched near bands continually passing either coming fort supplies going away equipped fresh raid upon settlements 
laughter talk among indians went long time henry eaten wanted sat silence 
besides noise camp heard usual murmur night wind among trees 
listened one would soft low monotone called soothed 
uncommonly acute ear power singleness concentration enabled listen sound wished hear exclusion others 
noises camp although great ever seemed die 
instead heard rustling young leaves far away another sound came faint whining cry far howl wolf far whisper mere note wind 
stopped moment two repeated 
henry heart leaped figure never moved change expression face dreamy sad

first part signal comrades often used listened second part completed 
longed send back reply impossible knew would expected 
joy mask sad dreaming face

yet peace races 
peace means push us back always push us back 
east white men many mighty confederation six nations great chief thayendanegea head fight vain seen rich villages indians go smoke indians still fight 
strike many yengees sometimes burn village white people unless king prevails great war surely lose 
aieroski manitou wyandots god merely looks permits stronger victor 
said henry make peace us west lest tribes meet fate nostrils timmendiquas dilated 
end eaten way 
west villages tiny 
seed planted deep uprooted 
henry sighed 
see question side well mine white lightning replied 
seems say white men red men dwell together 
yet could wish friends field well heart 
timmendiquas shook head replied tone tinged certain sadness could wish born one race another 
destiny fight end

henry meanwhile still watched passing canoes 
last far river holderness looked became dot water like others sank sight 
english friend walked palisade upon unfinished pier watched twilight come great forest 
setting sun slow red light falling branches trees always appealed henry impressed holderness yet used sense mystery awe

henry crouched little timbers almost manner wolf came forth three feet holderness long whining cry fierce sibilant despite natural bravery convulsive shudder swept young lieutenant 
cry although whining note never lost rose swelled swept river penetrated great canadian forest 
died slowly ferocious note remained last 
jove holderness could say instant cry rose beside many modulations inflections

henry resumed command others instantly accepted natural proper thing world 
mast unshipped sail lashed everything loose put lockers tied securely 
meanwhile cloud grew amazing rapidity

waters motionless hitherto suddenly heaved convulsively 
low thunder rolled lightning flashed across troubled waters 
five felt awe 
familiar great storms never one land sight 
little boat alone lay depths lake became smaller smaller 
five although felt tremors going battle sat oars thwarts ready fight best could storm would soon rush upon 
cold wind came raw gusts rain edge cut like hail 
boat rose fell increasing waves 
henry took helm others oars strove keep boat steady possible 
usual foresight borderers already covered rifles pistols ammunition 
even water would neglect precaution 
darkness spread entire heavens thunder crashed heavily like invisible batteries firing lightning flared two three times showing surface lake far wide tinted ghastly gray shriek roar wind struck 
boat heeled far side henry thought first gone hanging moment two seemingly undecided righted five uttered simultaneous sighs relief 
yet boat shipped water paul began bail cap others strove oars seeking meet ride waves followed one another swiftly

darkness lightened somewhat henry looked anxiously 
trying reckon direction come nothing would enable tell

fact contrary custom indian warfare henry saw wisdom restraint timmendiquas 
indians generally attack impulse without system wasting nothing useless skirmishing 
warriors gathered time ripe would timmendiquas attempt blow
