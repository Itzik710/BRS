preface 
whether translation homer may best executed blank verse rhyme question decision man find difficulty ever duly considered translation ought degree practically acquainted different kinds versification 
venture assert translation ancient poet rhyme impossible 
human ingenuity equal task closing every couplet sounds homotonous expressing time full sense full sense original 
translator ingenuity indeed case becomes snare readier invention expedient likely betrayed widest departures guide professes follow 
hence happened although public long possession english homer poet whose writings done immortal honor country demand new one especially blank verse repeatedly loudly made best judges ablest writers present day 
contest predecessor 
none supposable performers different instruments 
mr pope surmounted difficulties version homer possible surmount rhyme 
fettered fetters choice 
accustomed always rhyme formed ear probably could much gratified verse wanted determined encounter even impossibilities rather abandon mode writing excelled every body sake another unexercised must felt strong objections 
number among warmest admirers mr pope original writer allow merit justly claim translator chief poets 
given us tale troy divine smooth verse generally correct elegant language diction often highly poetical 
deviations many occasioned chiefly cause already mentioned much done valuable work accounts yet humble province translator thought possible even fellow advantage 
sometimes altogether suppressed sense author seldom intermingled ideas remark occasion nothing necessity extorted 
differ sometimes widely matter unless remark invidious seems premised know obviate suspicion one hand careless oversight factitious embellishment 
head therefore english reader admonished matter found whether like found also homer matter found much soever may admire found mr pope 
omitted nothing invented nothing 
indisputably wide difference case original writer rhyme translator 
original work author free rhyme difficult attainment find one direction liberty seek another matter accommodate occasions may discard adopting 
translation option allowable sense author required surrender willingly even plea necessity 
fidelity indeed essence translation term implies 
reason suppress sense original force place may call work imitation please perhaps paraphrase longer author different dress therefore translation 
painter professing draw likeness beautiful woman give fewer features belong general cast countenance invention might said produced jeu esprit curiosity perhaps way means lady question 
however necessary speak little largely subject discordant opinions prevail even among good judges 
free close translation advocates 
inconveniences belong 
former hardly true original author style manner latter apt servile 
one loses peculiarities spirit 
possible therefore find exact medium manner close let slip nothing text mingle thing extraneous time free air originality seems precisely mode author might best rendered 
assure readers experience discover delicate line difficult proceed found whole length poet voluminous homer nearly impossible 
pretend endeavored 
opinion commonly received like many others indebted prevalence mere want examination translator imagine style author would probably used language rendered 
direction wants nothing practicability recommend 
suppose six persons equally qualified task employed translate ancient language rule guide 
event would found fallen manner different rest probable inference would follow none fallen right 
whole therefore said translation partakes equally fidelity liberality close close servile free free licentious promises fairest ambition sufficiently gratified readers able take pains compare respect homer shall judge measure attained point difficult 
energy harmony two grand requisites translation energetic harmonious poets neither purpose wish found deficient either shelter unfilial imputation blame mother tongue 
language indeed less musical greek language acquainted 
musical enough purposes melodious verse seem fail whatsoever occasion energy blame due unskilful manager 
long milton works whether prose verse shall exist long abundant proof subject however important however sublime demand greater force expression within compass english language 
fear judges familiar original homer 
need told translation arduous enterprise entitled favor 
therefore shall expect shall disappointed considerable candor allowance 
especially candid believe many occasionally tried strength bow ulysses 
found supple pliable perhaps ready acknowledge could always even approach mark ambition 
would willingly possible obviate uncandid criticism answer lost labor receive silence appearance stately reserve self importance 
therefore shall inclined tell hereafter diction often plain unelevated reply beforehand know would absurd otherwise homer stands predicament 
fact one numberless excellences point judgment never fails grand lofty always right place knows infallibly rise fall subject 
big words small matters may serve pretty exact definition burlesque instance find battle frogs mice none iliad 
others expect told numbers though tolerably smooth always ugly hitch gait ungraceful inconvenient reader 
charge also plead guilty beg leave alleviation judgment add limping lines numerous compared limp 
truth one escaped made wilful intention 
poems great length blemish feared sameness numbers every art useful may avoided 
line rough yet recommendations saves ear pain irksome monotony seems even add greater smoothness others 
milton whose ear taste exquisite exemplified paradise lost effect practice frequently 
mentioned milton add observation similitude manner homer 
person familiar read either without reminded breaks pauses numbers english poet much indebted dignity variety chiefly copies grecian 
graces rhyme competent broken loses music person may convince reading page poets anterior denham waller dryden 
translator homer therefore seems directed homer use blank verse alone rendered tolerable representation manner particular 
remark naturally led make desire conciliate possible rather unreasonably partial rhyme demand occasions seem persuaded poetry language vain attempt without 
verse claims verse right metre judge rather courtesy kind apprehension costs writer little trouble give lines prescribed number syllables far mechanical part concerned well 
true would reason side author certainly best entitled applause succeeds greatest difficulty verse calls artificial management construction 
case suppose 
rhyme language demands great exertion ingenuity always easy person exercised practice 
witness multitudes rhyme poetical pretensions 
let considered merciful apt unclassical indifferent language sake rhyme shall soon see labor lies principally side 
many ornaments easy purchase required atone absence single recommendation 
sufficient lines blank verse smooth must also harmonious combination 
whereas chief concern rhymist beware couplets sense commensurate lest regularity numbers frequently least interrupted 
trivial difficulty compared attend poet unaccompanied bells 
order may musical must exhibit variations proceeds ten syllables susceptible first syllable last place must occasionally pause place pause must perpetually shifted 
effect variety attention must given one time pauses already made period well make shall succeed 
lighter terms possible blank verse written course long work fatigue ear past endurance 
easier therefore throw five balls air catch succession sport manner one may blank verse easily fabricated rhyme 
labors add others equally requisite style general elaborate rhyme requires farther removed vernacular idiom language arrangement shall long doubt two different species verse threatens composer expense study contrivance 
feel unpleasant appeal experience voucher hand constrained 
affirm found 
dealt pretty largely kinds frequently written verses day tags could ever write without 
said whether said others tell never read modern book subject shall add poetical without rhyme argument sound classical constitution language 
word two subject following translation done 
chief boast adhered closely original convinced every departure would punished forfeiture grace beauty could substitute equivalent 
epithets would consent english form preserved epithets others would melted context 
none believe translated one way though reader find repeated often homer reason need mentioned 
persons consideration introduced either iliad odyssey name patronymic given also 
ceremonial generally attended circumstance author manner 
homer never allots less whole line introduction speaker 
even speech longer line leads 
practice since never departs must determined cogent reason 
probably deemed formality necessary majesty narration 
article therefore scrupulously adhered pattern considering introductory lines heralds procession important persons employed usher persons important 
point every little verbose possible though time constant determination sacrifice author full meaning affected brevity 
affair style endeavored neither creep bluster author likely betray translator faults homer though never guilty either 
cautiously avoided terms new invention abundance persons ingenuity judgment enriched language incumbered 
also every used unabbreviated fullness phrase suited nature work studied perspicuity verse good little wants homer perspicuous poets 
difficult places consulted best commentators differed given often case variety solutions ever exercised best judgment selected appears least probable interpretation 
ground account fidelity already boasted may venture believe recommend work promising usefulness young students original 
passages least noticed possibly except shall wish find fault cost abundantly labor 
difficult kill sheep dignity modern language flay prepare table detailing every circumstance process 
difficult also without sinking level poetry harness mules wagon particularizing every article furniture straps rings staples even tying knots kept together 
homer writes always eye sublimity grandeur minuteness flemish painter 
degree succeeded version either passages others buoyant ground especially sublime submitted decision reader ready enough confess consulted approbation account nothing grand turgid elegant bedizened metaphor 
purposely decline declamation merits homer translator praises author liable suspicion dotage impossible improve author received already 
wonder countries works ever reached even deified greatest names antiquity places actually worshipped 
say truth possible mere man could entitle pre eminence kind divine honors homer astonishing powers seem given best pretensions 
conclude without due acknowledgments best critic homer ever met learned ingenious mr fuseli 
unknown entered arduous undertaking indeed moment never seen yet voluntarily generously offered revisor 
classical taste discernment indebted discovery many blemishes work beauties would otherwise escaped original 
necessary avocations would suffer accompany farther latter books iliad circumstance fear readers well regret much reason

preface prepared mr cowper second edition 
soon publication work began prepare second edition accurate revisal first 
seemed perhaps slight alteration might satisfy demands desirous please comforted reflection still failed conciliate yet cause account singular degree unfortunate 
please unqualified judge author must sacrifice much attempt please uncandid one altogether hopeless 
one classes may ranged objectors would deprive blank verse one principal advantages variety pauses together deny good effect whole line less harmonious fellows 
respect pauses affirmed unaccountable rashness homer given example verse without 
true would means concluded use english version homer one language one species metre may musical another would found disgusting 
assertion totally unfounded 
pauses homer verse frequent various name another poet pauses fault faulty perhaps impossible 
may even questioned single passage ten lines flowing uninterrupted smoothness could singled thousands left us 
frequently pauses first word line consists three syllables seldom two sometimes even one 
practice followed observed preface first edition author paradise lost 
example inimitable indeed writer english heroic verse without rhyme neglect impunity 
similar objection proscribes absolutely occasional use line irregularly constructed 
horace censured lucilius lines incomposite pede currentes mean say chargeable instances even many censure would equally applicable designed expression characterize writings 
censure therefore lucilius wrote time roman verse yet received polish instead introducing artfully rugged lines serve particular purpose probably seldom never accident composed smooth one 
versification earliest poets every country 
children lisp first stammer time speech becomes fluent well taught harmonious 
homer invariably regular construction verse 
eustathius excellent critic warm admirer homer never affirmed lines want head tail others middle 
begin word neither dactyl spondee conclude dactyl intermediate part sometimes deviates equally established custom 
confess instances sort rare surely though sufficient warrant sparing use similar license present day 
unwilling however seem obstinate particulars conformed measure objections though unconvinced propriety 
several rudest unshapely lines composed anew several pauses least use displaced sake easier enunciation 
state work revisal given seven years since 
revisal present considerable time intervened effect long discontinuance became dissatisfied difficult pleased judges 
sake uneven lines unwonted pauses reasons far substantial 
diction seemed many passages either sufficiently elevated deficient grace ease others found sense original either adequately expressed misapprehended 
many elisions still remained unsoftened compound epithets found always happily combined sometimes frequently repeated 
end passages homer must creep unless lifted yet embellishment question 
hero puts clothes refreshes food wine yokes steed takes journey evening preparation made repose 
give relief subjects prosaic without seeming unreasonably tumid extremely difficult 
mr pope much abridges others omits neither liberties compatible nature undertaking 
therefore many similar new modeled somewhat advantage hope even entirely satisfaction 
lines natural movement pauses fewer less stately expression easy could make without meanness improvements could give 
elisions believe cured one exception 
alternative proposes modern versifier escape occurs perpetually choose may presents always evil 
mean instance particle 
particle precedes vowel shall melt substantive leave hiatus open practices offensive delicate ear 
particle absorbed occasions harshness open vowel vacuity equally inconvenient 
sometimes therefore leave open sometimes ingraft adjunct seems advisable course mr pope taken whose authority recommended though two evils frequently chosen elision least 
compound epithets obtained long poetical language country employed without fear scruple 
abstained blank verse translation homer abounds poets probably first adopted would strange indeed 
though genius language favors formation words almost much greek happens sometimes grecian compound either rendered english best awkwardly 
reason found readers much disliked expunged many retaining according best judgment eligible making less frequent repetitions even 
know add thing material subject last revisal unless proper give reason iliad though greatly altered undergone much fewer alterations odyssey 
true reason believe 
iliad demanded utmost possible exertions seemed meet like ascent almost perpendicular could surmounted less cost labor could bestow 
odyssey contrary seemed resemble open level country might travel ease 
latter therefore betrayed negligence though little conscious time accurate search found left many disagreeable effects behind 
leave work fate 
another may labor hereafter attempt kind success industriously believe none ever
