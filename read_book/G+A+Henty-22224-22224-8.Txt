edgar found arrival alexandria mother sisters leave england 
mrs blagrove become seriously indisposed result maintained climate far due indolent habits never took exercise whatever 
general health greatly impaired two italian doctors attended english medical men resident strongly advised return home 
frankly told mr blagrove colder climate absolutely necessary would brace act tonic would probably induced take certain amount exercise 
two girls accompany order like edgar enjoy advantage going english school mixing english girls age 
felt heat preceding summer mr blagrove felt stay two three years england would immense advantage 
mrs blagrove stay father clergyman west england months husband intended go time 
war much reduced business activity french privateers rendered communication irregular precarious rates freight insurance high number vessels entering port tithe frequented outbreak war small part mr blagrove business consisted supplying vessels stores needed operations restricted felt could without great loss leave management affairs hands chief assistant german twenty years placed greatest reliance 
edgar would assist generally father thought would even benefit placed time responsible position 
course great disappointment edgar find mother girls point returning

cruising time sent home number prizes returning england another refit fill crew 
fast vessel captain said intended make straight home avoid doubtful sail mr blagrove accepted offer made take wife daughters back england immediately heard friend looking passage

however effect enabling without interruption settle steadily work father make acquainted details business 
industriously mr blagrove said getting well edgar shall able go home holiday comfortable conviction muller hands matters go well especially business slack 
three months return edgar opportunity finding advantage skill boxing 
day came back sack sawdust hung room every morning used pummel half hour taking bath going bed kept muscles state training 
moreover exercise advantage enabled stand heat climate much better would otherwise done save feeling lassitude depression usual among englishmen working hot climates 
returning one day ride dusk fallen beyond limits town heard shouts cries saw scuffle going road 
cantering leapt horse dropped reins neck ran forward 
two lowest class maltese greeks dragging young arab along holding hands prevent getting knife beating head disengaged hands 
evident one dwellers city arab desert 
horse stood near apparently dragged 
matter beating asked italian 
arab dog pushed us horse cursed struck us 
well punished enough perhaps story different one 
go way boy one exclaimed greek oath throw fountain going 
eh unloose lad worse 
man uttered shout rage 
hold young arab wolf hand giaccamo use knife 
settle boy companion seized lad wrist 
rushed edgar waving arms windmill fashion thinking strike without least difficulty astounded met terrific blow nose nigh threw balance followed instant later another point chin hurled back half stunned ground vague impression mind head broken fragments 
even thought rising edgar sprang companion releasing arab boy hands grasped knife could draw blow given edgar strength impetus bound forward stretched also ground knife flying hand 
arab boy drawn knife also edgar exclaimed language pick knife stand stab 
turned first assailant rising feet still confused bewildered 
instinctively drawn knife 
drop knife drop edgar cried 
oath man sprang 
eyes however full tears ears sung head buzzed partly blow jaw partly force come contact ground 
edward lightly sprung aside avoided cut aimed delivered blow force front ear man dropped shot 
moment edgar wrenched knife hand turned young arab 
enough said got wanted harmless two knives 
arab panting exertions evidently restrained difficulty plunging knife fallen assailant turned round towards 
brother whose blows fell men like strokes lightning name edgar blagrove 
son merchant whose place business great square 
business begin name sidi ben ouafy 
son chief 
father tribe live oasis ten miles east old lake 
riding town two men see plenty room road staggered suddenly whether evil intent merely enjoy pleasure seeing rolling dust know 
nearly unseated suddenness attack recovered certainly struck whip 
one seized foot threw horse saw fell upon beat dragging fountain throw came 
heard horse coming along would believe killed 
henceforth brother horses every sword tribe would leap scabbard defense needed 
morrow ride father assuredly come 
speak gratitude head still dizzy blows gave even yet understand two men thus fallen weapon hands 
dead edgar said scornfully wondering happened fear move knowing knives might driven hearts venture rise 
well good bye sidi see first advise ride town bring pistols 
like enough scoundrels try get revenge defeat 

know carry day

open attack fear doubt either scoundrels would plant knife shoulders chance 
lads mounted horses words farewell rode different directions 
sound horses hoofs died away two figures road move sat

fellows would murder sake copper coins doubtless men thought young chief would trinkets would pay trouble 
sorry let arab put knife would good riddance town abounds rascals kind scum mediterranean men made native towns hot hold committed crimes untold 
careful fellows kind forgiving nature patient enough wait revenge sooner later attempt take 
dark father scarcely seen face 
perhaps doubt able make figure better class young europeans 
guard lad better always carry pistols 
clever may fists attacked half dozen fellows knives would stand little chance 
dusk daylight fairly safe 
rate would avoid rookeries lower class european inhabitants live 
brace short barrelled pistols stairs give 
carried one time things unsettled 
made two bitter enemies hand made friend may useful 
arabs form friendship true steel event fanatical troubles would find sure refuge among 
lad father aboo ben ouafy know little made purchases 
tribe large one fine fellow 
lad told head quarters oasis eight ten miles believe east old site lake mareotis 
course like people frequently absent hunting plundering expeditions 
next day sidi father followed half dozen tribesmen halted front mr blagrove place business two former dismounted entered 
bedouin chief saluted merchant gravely sidi went edgar sitting table worked hours day father office rose lad approach held hand english fashion 
none worse scrimmage last night sidi said heartily

back may scoff pursuit foes outside encampment horse egypt could distance 
like save sell would blood run veins save horses tribe 
indeed princely gift sheik merchant said warmly 
tis noble horse one king might ride 
son indeed indebted value beyond price 
edgar warm expressions gratitude admiration although indeed unable appreciate full value points animal 
gray english eyes would looked light wanting bone fit rather lady use man slender limbs small head one accustomed arab horses mr blagrove could see purest strain highest breeding

present see accustomed white face soon come love answer call 
horse indeed laid back ears distended dilated nostrils stepped back foot two sheik approached gave little whinny pleasure advancing laid muzzle cheek 
new master beauty said stroked glossy neck 
keep well one children must good friend servant

quiver fear ran touched continued died away edgar spoke quietly arabic long responded caresses taking good look soft liquid eyes put head shoulder 
friends sheik said tone pleasure 
even tribesmen would give greeting 
recognizes already friend 
give handful sweetmeats bargain sealed 
merchant sent one native boys buy bag sweetmeats 
sheik waited saw horse taking edgar hands munching contentedly leaving one tribesmen charge horse mounted rode son rest followers 
edgar stood time talking horse leaving native went house make preparations journey 
indeed done well edgar father said came 
tis every way fortunate 
turks love us little though put us need goods sell still may moment fanatical rising well indeed made friends one desert tribes among find safe refuge 
little know value horse given 
breed famous one sheik offered fabulous sum one steeds nothing could tempt part one 
arab prizes valuable horse beyond earthly possessions save pressure direst want nothing could persuade part 
presenting therefore chief shown friendship striking manner possible regards says one family 
chapter ii 
bedouin tribe 
two hours sheik returned 
fortunate said mr blagrove edgar came court yard entered 
men punishment 
governor hearing story sent head police charged take four men quarter men sort generally found 
son described men said thought one maltese named giaccamo greek called zeno spoke men said knew two fellows generally went together answered description 
said notorious ruffians except rioting wounding among compatriots police concern able find nothing though strongly suspected concerned many crimes 
went quarter police soon found place lived enquiry assured men ill old woman came door declaring bed days 
however police insisted upon entering speedily brought 
sidi recognized indeed scarcely lied saying ill eyelids one swollen blackened could see nose well nigh big rest face 
taken cadi 
heard son evidence said proved attempted steal horse would heads smitten though doubtless intention done 
sentenced hundred blows stick expelled town neighborhood warning found near town would assuredly punished death 
waited saw blows administered although felt angry cadi ordered execution admit punishment severe enough wretches howled like whipped curs 
trust trouble 
still hope prevent son coming visit us 
certainly sheik 
prepared ready go looking forward stay much pleasure even wish could deprive enjoyment 
still heartily glad two fellows expelled town never felt easy edgar safety long 
minutes later party set 
edgar valise fastened saddle one sheik followers 
road ran along sandy dunes divided low country formerly covered lake mareotis sea soon well town horses broke gallop 
point actual speed even best arab horses hold moderate english race horse whose greater height longer stride gives advantage greatly superior last possess extraordinary endurance stamina 
brought belonging family owners intelligence cultivated dogs 
exceedingly docile affectionate 
pace easy one edgar delighted indeed manner new acquisition flew along without apparent exertion continuing pace without check reached arab encampment hour twenty minutes leaving alexandria 
leapt horses front group black tents 
oasis small extent extending two hundred yards across 
center group thirty forty palm trees 
near herbage thick gradually dwindling away became lost sand 
center near tents well irregularly shaped pit five twenty feet deep rough path women went get water use horses 
score tethered grass 
welcome tents sheik said may visit fortunate one mulick called one arab boys take beauty first went edgar best talked little gave sweets 
soon get love well hear voice often possible 
lead edgar replied mulick tether 
shall know another time 
patted arab glossy neck rubbed ears praised giving handful sweets 
beauty evidently appreciated attentions replied low whinny 
took saddle led spot mulick pointed watched boy tether took bridle carried back tents 
woman came largest 
veiled except go towns bedouin women seldom conceal faces 
ayala sheik said young white lord saved sidi attacked henceforth one tribe 
may blessings allah fall upon woman said 
sidi child 
taken us lives would desolate indeed 
glad happened come along time edgar said 
fortunate occurrence much indeed sidi 
friends age great pleasure sort brother 
sure shall get capitally together 
besides husband given grand horse could never obtained money 
sidi able teach arab ways daresay shall able show something customs life 
edgar shown tent newly erected use 
furniture simple consisting handsome eastern carpet covered ground pile rugs sofa bed 
hanging one sticks supported tent porous jar water 
hung rifle pistols powder horn bullet pouch furnishing complete 
tribe asked sidi came tent 
oh tribe dwells large oasis hundred miles south fifty miles west cairo 
portions tribe dwelling far spot ride five hundred strong go fight berbers morocco 
father sheik section 
generally six tents left keep possession often away months 
find buy goods tribe requires cheaper alexandria cairo indeed often go ill blood exists us authorities ventured complaint send party mamelukes us 
beat back handsomely leave oasis time could withstand force would sure send us 
thirty years ago 
filled wells cut palm trees 
wells soon cleared palm groves grown 
interfered us even care visit cairo though may matter altogether forgotten 
edgar remained fortnight new friends enjoyed life much 
took lessons sidi hurling lance discovered would need long practice indeed enable accuracy shown arabs 
also practiced rifles pistols 
left gave warm invitation sidi come stay 
however arab lad declined 
comfortable european dwelling said 
miserable sitting one chairs 
father busy altogether element 
might said thing sidi oh easy fling restraint throw sand ride shoot hurl spear 
sports enjoy much 
come often see ask stay 
edgar saw better press matter rate present 
time sidi became accustomed european ways might perhaps come stay came would penance rather pleasure 
time young arab rode frequently leaving camp daybreak arriving time spend long day edgar 
sometimes rode together sometimes walked along sea shore sidi soon learned enjoy much friend row sail water first altogether novelty 
merchant possessed several boats used business pretty gig carried sail went visit ships brought goods 
times edgar service 
learned even going school manage therefore unnecessary take anyone 
sidi first take kindly oar 
trained hard exercise horseback sports tribe yet great aversion anything like steady labor unable even understand edgar willingness exert oar could men row 
time however mastered initial difficulties art took exercise often spent whole day boat either coasting along aboukir bay often shooting lakes 
arrival british fleet created quite excitement alexandria news brought large french fleet left toulon carrying many thousands troops destined believed operate egypt caused intense feeling dismay among british merchants settled corresponding exultation among french 
french fleet stronger sidi asked edgar leaned parapet looked long line british ships 
may likely edgar said carelessly makes matter sure thrash 
first place always somehow next fleet commanded one best admirals fear beaten 
fear fleet mayn fall french landed troops 
troops could stand mamelukes sidi said scornfully 
would soon drive sea 
sure edgar said 
doubt mamelukes splendid horsemen 
suppose good world horsemen win battle alone 
french infantry fine doubt whether number horsemen could break squares 
artillery immensely superior egyptians give great advantage 
fleet meets beats could ever get back expect mean stay hold country edgar said 
know good would still suppose think would would take trouble come 
take country would bad men like father would sure put english prison would ruin business 
would put prison know expect 
would hold english prisoners 
would come us 
quite safe 
soldiers came would never catch us could move anywhere know places water found would die thirst went us desert 
well hope going sidi french land like much 
suppose would fight french 
came take egypt course could see fight us 
would jolly sidi like nothing better course shall father tells 
expect would shut place get goods board ship go away till able 
doubt would want go 
evening edgar learned rightly guessed steps father would take case french army landed 
awkward business lad said 
course nelson comes french fleet may hope come right catches manage land twenty thirty thousand troops position would serious one 
intend charter petrel discharged cargo brought 
shall put valuable goods board especially egyptian carpets oriental work within hours hearing fleet coast ready sail england 
course would end business long french remained egypt doubt british subjects could lay hands would thrown prison case occupied holland 
however propose shut house altogether although english would seized thrown prison place closed france war germany muller could carry shipping business without interruption name substituted mine 
instruct trade interior everything turned topsy turvy trade sort would end 
hand french masters considerable number french italian ships coming stores kinds often need supplies repairs men capable anything way refitting muller could keep things going carry business pay expenses would probably leave margin profit 
rate house would go wreck ruin business entirely lost 
think french occupation would likely last many months 
may sure would great efforts made home 
tremendous fleet would sent difficulties bringing stores reinforcements army would enormous 
possibly may land army 
certainly could nowhere fight french advantageously would case india long superior sea could bring troops safely expeditiously could 
however seems best arrangement make french land 
would make great difference know arranged sail three weeks england 
alteration would must accompany instead staying 
even putting aside fact would made prisoner would stayed hindrance rather help business 
muller would carry purely german firm would evident merely left temporarily representative 
would fatal muller business french 
see father although must say would rather stop see fun 
mr blagrove smiled 
suppose would see much case edgar 
however question 
daresay correspondents london able take office get situation kind elsewhere stop england year wasting time 
however french come yet hardly think intend undertake expedition even fleet strong enough ere long certainly raised point completely cut france 
even come father may succeed conquering egypt 
think mamelukes able make head know strong french even come great force mamelukes well handled edgar ought able prevent advancing far inland 
ought hang clouds round driving cavalry whenever ventured leave shelter infantry fire 
ought harass night day prevent obtaining supplies sort 
afraid nothing kind done 
mamelukes spoilt puffed believe invincible make grand charge sweep french away 
however make great difference us fairly away course shall think returning matters settled 
french traders bad time since war began left long ago seldom vessel got cruisers could rely upon regular supplies goods 
course many small shopkeepers take goods retail natives importers left 
afraid going turn unless nelson manages intercept fleet easy matter might land anywhere along coast syria 
imagine descent take place near town could follow fresh water canal point flows nile cairo 
may however land either damietta rosetta mouths river still think likely come seeing ships could closely approach shore 
british fleet remained hours alexandria 
short peace campo formio caused greater portion british fleet recalled mediterranean french preparations almost complete news reached england vast number transports collected french various ports provisions kinds put board rumored army embark unknown destination 
nelson sent fleet blockade toulon port evident men war intended guard great fleet transports would start 
arrived first june learn french fleet set three days previously 
idea egypt destination entered minds british ministers although nelson furnished instructions course taken case almost every contingency never even discussed 
french fleet consisted vessels line frigates corvettes despatch boats 
exception smaller vessels furnished toulon 
men embarked transports 
joined transports marseilles corsica genoa civita vecchia bringing total transports carrying men 
one arm army extremely deficient horses could put board 
cavalry however took saddles bridles rest artillery train 
nelson started search enemy clue direction taken able obtain news whereabouts heard captured without resistance island malta 
returned speed imagining first time possibly egypt object attack made alexandria 
arrival heard nothing known french movements although fact fleet day lying anchor cape harzet twenty leagues west 
supposing therefore must sailed coast syria constantinople steered alexandretta learning captured malta french fleet sailed candia left rhodes searched everywhere islands archipelago anchored cape matapan southern extremity morea first learned french army landed egypt month 
object french expedition vast one means undertaken insufficient execution difficulties way infinitely greater supposed paris 
bonaparte chosen command principally directory feared great popularity victorious general would render formidable 
knew already means favourably disposed towards therefore anxious remove public eye 
napoleon part perfectly aware reason appointed command accepted belief vast amount glory gained plans directory entirely carried india wrested english name would placed side alexander history 
already negotiations carried time tippoo sahib 
commissioners despatched alliance proposed british 
power greatly overrated french feeble idea entertained enormous difficulties scheme proposed completely subduing organizing egypt march syria damascus thence head persian gulf thence india 
account taken enormous difficulties journey 
thought powerful warlike people northern india 
idea revenge total overthrow french power india british establish firmer wider base ever humiliate pride england obtain monopoly trade east 
news possibly french fleet might moment appear port spread greatest dismay throughout alexandria native population furious foreigners scarcely dared show streets 
mr blagrove edgar busy morning till night day british fleet left transporting goods store ship chartered 
quite possible needless merchant said edgar sat hasty meal late evening 
think almost absurd although mean leave anything chance purely surmise french expedition intended operate egypt 
seems either greece syria much likely destination 
letter put hand brought captain small maltese trader 
correspondent malta 
states french fleet appeared island summoned knights surrender thought probable demand acceded 
said sent line little coaster intended sail late evening taking cargo grain alexandria 
certainly looks expedition intended operate farther east malta altogether way fleet coming toulon hither 
still well continue work 
naturally enough violent ferment among native population may improbably find vent fanatical attack upon christians 
rate get rest goods value board await events 
next evening preparations completed 
ferment somewhat cooled people beginning think excitement roused mere vague report absurd 
next morning breakfast mr blagrove said son think edgar things quieted beginning hope scare altogether unfounded would well ride friends desert stay night come back morrow 
would think strange discourteous leave suddenly without communicating hope absence short duration sorry give people well disposed towards ground offence 
return morrow evening 
extremely remote possibility french fleet made time must embark mother sisters sake 
would madness wait simple madness 
even putting aside certainty captivity long period means improbable would sudden rising part population massacre foreigners 
consider contingency remote scarcely worth speaking french fleet arrive thirty six hours away obliged embark sail must stay arab friends 
see worth goods board petrel loss would extremely heavy one besides cash 
shall leave muller hands ample needs heavy stock ships stores warehouse 
shall course instruct supply money may require 
understand regard extremely improbable well make arrangements every contingency 
french fleet come sight embark board petrel set sail without great anxiety account 
relieve mind think reasonable ground thinking necessary fifty pounds gold best sew securely band trousers night great trouble safer loose pocket 
edgar rode away next morning could help thinking would great fun french arrive returned 
thought year two passed stuffy office london agreeable one stay bedouins might life excitement adventure 
doubt tribes would fight invaders impelled first place intense love independence second invaders christians 
thought dashing charges skirmishing french cavalry pursuit flight fascinating high spirited lad seventeen indulging fancies time sighed thought small chance becoming reality 
heartily welcomed arrival oasis 
news sidi brought visit british fleet fact search great french fleet carrying army might possibly intended invasion egypt created great excitement camp 
think true sheik asked wild idea come people think could conquer country say edgar replied 
come would formidable opponents conquered many countries europe soldiers well trained disciplined great numbers guns father thinks hardly intend come landed soon enough ships war prevent return would cut france altogether 
news fleet except arrived island malta 
whither sailed thence know 
fleet gone search fight find 
escape really come hither father embark board ship loaded valuable goods shall sail england 
reason ridden morning 
go departure sudden get anchor soon french fleet made distance rate soon became dark enough hide departure sorry indeed go without saying good bye 
long go brother sidi asked 
trouble might two three months might many years 
glad go back country sheik asked 
indeed 
work office london would dull work light amusements friends 
stay behind us father returns know would welcome would gladden hearts us 
like things sheik edgar said warmly thank heartily invitation course must father wishes thinks best go england french come would keep us prisoners would seize goods merchandise 
however seem likely french really come considered possible might suggested come stay morrow afternoon lest leave suddenly might think forgotten haste 
wish could stay 
suppose french came would fight could fight tribe assuredly fight sheik said 
franks come molest us love turkish rule much way molested 
assuredly every arab desert ride aid mamelukes drive sea 
great army would bring us hear officers fleet news received england said men preparing embark unknown destination 
thirty thousand sheik said scornfully mameluke cavalry fully infantry janizaries spahis besides levy whole population desert tribes put horsemen field 
never dare come us unless force much larger speak 
egypt expedition sailed 
father thinks edgar said force could bring would know might cut time returning fleet position would become desperate 
long blockaded ports strong enough get still less would able leave egypt 
let us talk sheik said contemptuously 
dogs come hither shall know deal 
chapter iii 
left behind 
sheik spoke words two followers mounted horses rode 
bring us news anything happens said go alexandria 
late evening returned 
news sheik said came fire sitting

party traveled without haste 
arriving nile edgar suggested sheik would well discard european dress arab one 
damanhour said marked people scowled rode streets doubt ride cairo ere long would save trouble attired escape notice 
would good plan sheik agreed 
daresay sidi supply suit 
purchase needed next place come edgar said money necessity may arise 
even putting aside trouble constantly questioned prefer arab dress baking sun think would good deal comfortable english clothes 
accordingly next town passed sidi edgar went together bazaar latter purchased usual amount bargaining clothes similar worn friend 
expense small costume arab chief differed little followers except burnoose finer cotton silken sash brilliant colors richer showy 
exception whole costume white although arab sheiks wore colored burnooses edgar chose white one friend father wore color 
bought two three changes clothes knew water often scarce washing garments could indulged frequently 
night camp pitched donned new costume placed pistols sash arab fashion 
sidi wound turban gave instructions clothes worn 
taken made bundle could resumed necessary 
felt rather awkward friend sallied tent shared 
look well edgar sheik said approvingly need stain arms legs better stain face neck also would attract quite much attention white arab would european dress 
thinking sheik much pleasanter able pass anywhere without comment

believe franks stand moment know night franks landed twenty mamelukes rode killed many brought heads triumph 
would ask us charge would deem shame ask aid encounter willing enough accept help cutting fugitives preventing others may land spreading country 
still feel sure mamelukes defeat french edgar said 
allah son 
mamelukes like people defended alexandria warriors

evening th french arrived village near chebreisse

french army drawn order last fight great squares divisions left resting nile right large village 
napoleon staff reconnoitered enemy entrenched camp means telescopes discovered cannon upon field carriages simply heavy ship guns taken flotilla served sailors 
therefore could moved evident infantry left camp must without guns 
entrenchment formidable begun three days although might impracticable cavalry would offer serious obstacle attack infantry 
discovery cannon immovable decided napoleon dispositions battle gave orders army move across right thus concentrated attack upon mamelukes arabs 
mourad bey seeing napoleon object ordered two thirds cavalry charge french motion others remain near entrenched camp 
rapidly sweep french squares fell confusion desaix division formed head column difficulty maintaining ranks somewhat broken grove palm trees passing 
however received mamelukes terrible fire musketry grape shot charge pressed home 
mamelukes however fought desperate courage sweeping round french squares even endeavoring back horses line bayonets hopes breaking wall steel 
length however could mourad men rode towards gizeh rest noticing way taken owing cloud dust smoke rode back entrenchment 
french pressed forward speed division thrown across plain prevent horsemen retreating line mourad taken

mamelukes seeing lost ascertained mourad ridden towards gizeh started endeavor rejoin among arabs cry rose desert turning horses galloped away passed foot pyramids desert halted seeing reach fire french guns fear whatever pursued 
allah sheik said party dismounted 
truly right friend edgar know fight 
could dreamt men foot could withstood charge five thousand horsemen yet mamelukes fought always bravely 
indeed sheik edgar agreed 
possible men fire infantry artillery horsemen powerless 
infantry well trained french instead remaining entrenchments could render assistance whatever marched french infantry broken squares mamelukes would able dash upon french soldier would ever reached ships without infantry horsemen could nothing 
think lost edgar assuredly lost present sheik 
mourad bey party may get away rest penned french river escape 
infantry mere mob even get away never venture stand french 
napoleon enter cairo morrow remain 
numbers horses fall hands french 
take many cairo long cavalry well infantry part country safe 
egypt fall altogether rule french time 
fleet soon return troops cut country 
may remain time last go 
think shall send army fight 
shall know strength reinforced find long run although may captured egypt prisoners 
would advise sheik asked 
understand ways customs franks know little child 
thus see matter graybeard boy 
therefore speak freely think best 
say sheik best course would return oasis 
french army doubtless remain near cairo 
send cavalry light artillery country search enemies reduce obedience 
around alexandria quiet long french convoys attacked force likely interfere peaceable people 
return live unmolested 
wait see matters go 
great rising french open take part present hostilities french would bring vengeance 
may arabs great oasis west continue war end sure suffer 
think advice good sheik said 
sidi shall return home half followers 
ride daybreak half 
one long day ride shall reach spot women baggage gone escort back 
road certainly safe franks time occupied cairo though hardly likely town resist 
ibrahim destruction mamelukes defeat army hope resist great attack fortifications like alexandria suffered decay french would assuredly soon force entrance 
however march made need rest time roads safe 
regard arabs 
whole country confusion unarmed caravan might well plundered party arabs met though would interfere headed sheik armed followers 
therefore go fetch 
son ride fast take possession home lest neighbors finding deserted occupy trouble would follow 
accordingly next morning daybreak troop divided rode different directions 
greater part gathering scattered evening determined return home wait events 
four days rapid traveling took sidi companions back oasis found exactly left tribes neighborhood busy following french army picking baggage left behind break horses attend matters 
next day sidi edgar rode alexandria everything going peacefully usual french soldiers lounging streets number labourers direction french officers work restoring fortifications sea face town shops open markets well supplied usual

inaction french never satisfactorily explained 
admiral brueys bore high reputation sailor 
personal friend possessed complete confidence bonaparte 
latter given strictest injunctions sail toulon soon completed discharge stores board 
instead however anchored aboukir bay waited 
may feared napoleon might never reach cairo might defeated great battle might necessary return port embark army 
explanation possible delay carrying imperative orders received

next day anniversary establishment republic celebrated grand review troops days later news came desaix division set pursuit mourad day battle pyramids overtaken another fierce fight ensued 
charge mamelukes broken one french squares time great confusion prevailed desaix shouted soldiers throw ground next square opened terrible fire mamelukes forced retreat 
two days later kleber marched division damietta 
native quarter agitation continued far peace broken french took little heed passing idea danger rising 
object provoke movement could hardly taken steps better calculated bring 
first place arrival proceeded largely strengthen increase fortifications altogether disregarded feelings people pulled houses mosques desecrated tombs cleared away buildings spaces ground across guns would play 
desecration sacred places given rise deepest feelings exasperation among people 
next place many fortifications converted guns menaced town instead country round citadel especially dominated whole city guns placed overawe 
next step deeply resented people interfering ancient usages 
cairo divided fifty quarters wall gate 
gates closed night indeed time orders chief quarter interruption caused breaks line communication given rise many quarrels soldiers townspeople 
inconvenience distinct one french without giving notice intentions sent strong party engineers supported troops demolish gateways 
taxes onerous extreme 
means council appointed consisting notabilities either fear bribery brought side french crushing taxation imposed rendered trading upper classes upon burden principally fell hostile french domination lower classes 
thus french high handed conduct absolute disregard feelings religious sentiments people prepared mine point exploding 
afternoon messenger arrived sheik saying pyramids following morning nine clock wished meet 
would take men us edgar think would best leave 
well established come looked upon around left tribe altogether intending work carriers 
tell one go town every day see matters going

therefore although may leave lower class alone may seize leaders may find came upon father wounds would show engaged fighting took town many saw might denounce sheik led horsemen one columns 
course may search well safe side better run slight risk journey might chance captured 
sidi heartily agreed 
sidi may well get rid clothes put peasant suit bought

sorry get hassan ali likely enough may able buy things village 
way father said riding pyramids town good many old tombs hills

big fleshy englishman would different thing altogether arabs simply bone muscle divided three weight worth talking 
blankets rolled placed across men shoulders water skins hung straps either side carried baskets also placed bundles clothes 
stir movement showed sheik conscious lifted ground 
twenty minutes walking got beyond area cultivated ground able head directly hills two hours later well among edgar sidi agreed small chance indeed french parties especially cavalry searching broken rugged ground 
spot chosen ends spears could laid two flat stones high enough keep bottom hammock touching ground 
sidi bent father listening breathing saw sound asleep 
share burden small shallow iron pot little charcoal fire glowed brightly 
small bag common fuel egypt bought village 
broth poured tin hung short distance fire would warm slowly 
edgar sidi completely worn wrapped one burnoose blanket lay hassan ali turns slept day undertaking keep watch side sheik give broth soon woke

feel move indeed surprised first waking ali told safe hills 
see already lift right hand

hurry edgar replied 
breakfast shall start look one tombs told 
shall shelter heat sun night dews 
fear french lighting upon us indeed think cairo feet trouble matter 
things think although cairo quiet long time french know merciless slaughter mussulmans excite deepest feeling hatred even less safe small parties move 
kleber doubt start division damietta 
desaix many days journey south 
probably force march suez 
heard said french officers would probably next move napoleon care weaken garrison city sending search parties 
sidi wound bad one nothing like severe received cheek 
downright blow turban saved 
pretty deep scalp wound extending ear lost good deal blood anxiety prospect death morning caused seem serious 
three four days nearly 
escape unhurt deemed certainly dead 
horse shot moment got bullet arm 
beyond loss little blood consequence 
ran house close sheltered french column came went european clothes found trouble 
chapter viii 
egyptian tomb 
arabs preparing breakfast edgar searched spot sheik could lie shelter mid day heat hot desert sands heat fully great bare rocks hills 
search found spot two ledges rock ran parallel passage six feet side rose perpendicularly twelve feet height 
fissures ran nearly north south therefore except hour noon bottom entirely shade 
within half mile spot encamped night returning sheik carried laid blanket 
spears found long enough reach across top 
blanket formed hammock unrolled formed sort awning could sun high moved little one way keep shade 
learning sheik direction tombs spoken situated edgar started hassan half hour walking came upon 
part square cut holes face perpendicular rock 
flanked pilasters cut stone others ornate designs 
originally closed great stone slabs 
long since moved broken treasure seekers 
plan similar short passage terminated chamber ten twenty feet square 
vestiges paintings originally covered walls could still seen 
choosing one larger tombs edgar aided hassan remove fragments stones projected dust sand lay six inches deep floor 
well satisfied returned sheik 
found good place said 
air quite cool sand make much comfortable bed bare rock 
sheik made reply lay looking expression puzzled turn sidi ask whether father worse latter said away son telling done saved life well mine 
weak say heart full words 
say thing sheik edgar said earnestly 
adopt tribe sidi call brother sheltered tents nowhere else go natural power repay benefits rescue brother sidi hands enemies deem fortunate enabled indeed ran little risk either case 
small thing search among dead carried found disguise european risk recognized fought french went testify favor sidi 
save name need go little beyond truth 
sidi gratitude aiding two ruffians 
slain man attack though take place supposed time massacre european shopkeepers main facts true fear telling get trouble 
sheik shook head 
tis well say friend suppose way people make little good actions 
risk may run 
many men brave charged column franks front us swept away cannon right say cowards see difference sidi thought dead beyond resolving avenge nothing 
idea might disguise franks advanced gone searched streets found whether still living never occurred us think arab would thought 
scarcely passed first danger discovered began think us 
learned many arabs killed poured city others taken prisoners 
wounded lose moment finding two followers 
night search among dead carry place safety 
without rest without pause return city begin take measures rescue sidi 
citadel strongly guarded french troops 
one way succeeding 
thought way 
planned 
invented likely story yet close truth 
went midst men fighting sustained character chosen none french officers suspected moment aught seemed listening pleading behalf let go free 
well say day though might beaten believed son would escape allah clearly sent save danger would therefore assuredly preserve 
illustration ali ayala appeared page allah god well thanked sheik lives preserved edgar said reverently united many perished 
spite shade blanket overhead edgar found tremendously hot middle day soon sun passed west able get hours comfortable sleep 
short time sunset started carried sheik cave 
two arabs edgar sidi loitered behind pulling parched bushes grew among rocks making faggots 
soon therefore sheik laid fire lighted giving cheerful air dark chamber 
ali hassan went brought provisions water bundles 
air cool pleasant tomb hearty meal made sheik however drank cup broth ate dates something like appetite 
sheik edgar said put sticks upon fire chat future plans 
talking sidi 
must fortnight three weeks fit sit horse 
fortunate way sent favorite horse well sidi mine back two followers pyramids decided enter town rode horses charge cairo 
would loss indeed noble steeds killed 
one first thoughts able think sheik said 
next wife son love zeila would sorely spoiled joy reunited fallen battle 
advice saved life also 
idea edgar went either hassan ali shall go back town get one horses ride oasis spare horses followers 
thirty men sheik said 
thought well bring misfortune happened women children would left without protectors surely occasion hassan go yet 
three days might back another three though hope mend quickly surely could mount horse week time 
quite see sheik wife women also thought well start 
two three men may escaped fight 
would sure make oasis doubtless report save killed 
wife mourning sidi dead reason would send one men good news 
thoughtful lad gray beard could think things 
thought news might reach say may well two three least men may escaped 
ali shall start morrow daybreak given message wife next say sheik bid men great pyramid twenty one days following morning join daybreak 
may well enough sheik said 
say certain edgar said tis best name date may hope fit ride long far need 
know plans french tis like enough though may granted pardon people city bonaparte endeavor strike heavy blows arabs 
knows terribly harassed march wheresoever troops may move swarm round 
overawed cairo safely leave small garrison marches away 
may well seek overawe arabs making expeditions oases easily cavalry mounted egyptian horses capable supporting thirst making long journeys may think striking camping places cutting palm trees filling wells may compel promise cease attacks upon troops 
might certainly damage us greatly way sheik agreed horses equal 
may sure tribes near alexandria basely sold horses part best franks took cairo accustomed desert save indeed mamelukes horses killed masters 
even well mounted might indeed reach oases terrible damage could laugh would carry far heavier weights 
french soldiers heavier riding boots accoutrements valises matters would ride forty fifty pounds heavier horses unaccustomed burdens would soon tire 
would well bid say four men come straight hither act guard think sheik fewer us better discovered four men forty would useless 
might defend mouth tomb short time even beat every attack would matter hours forced surrender want water 
hassan start ali morrow morning bring second horse back useful bringing water provisions 
hassan peasant dress would attract little attention noticed riding among hills 
tell buy two skins larger 
four bring sufficient water last us horse three days least make occasional journey village 
indeed several villages within short distance river bank going sometimes one sometimes another food water attract attention 
sheik said 
voice weakened drinking broth composed sleep example speedily imitated others 
sidi gave ali hassan necessary instructions started edgar took former apart private conversation

unfortunately likely case 
pashas experience war french best generals europe 
turks badly disciplined french veteran soldiers perfect confidence leaders 
still case greatly increase napoleon difficulties send greater portion army meet turks time keep egypt subjection 
british government blind see opportunity grand one striking blow french think would ere long send army though may unless see turks alone nothing 
later edgar heard columns french cavalry gone desert driven away bodies arabs assembled miles nile 
however unable gain advantages arabs always fallen back upon approach french finding pursuit useless returned city 
twice arabs killed cavalry closely followed battery artillery arabs unaware french guns therefore contented keeping beyond carbine shot first intimation presence cavalry rode rapidly right left leaving guns exposed

later days siege sir sidney smith issued great numbers printed copies letter sultan authorizing offer safe passage france french army would surrender

good work sir sidney said approvingly 
hardly thought would got guns board day 
commandant gave us complement turks help carry sir made short work 
expect lively time shall 
may pick store ships blockading always dull work 
however hope long sending force england finish french egypt 
must remember careful greek moslem pirates one bad hear generally work two three together though craft may small carry number men therefore boat expeditions always strong handed 
must bear mind although command like fine opportunity young officer distinguish upon hand meets misfortune tells 
seen mr blagrove frequently heavy fire scarcely ventured appoint charge know cool steady short officers feeling urgent importance something put stop alarming increase piracy consider justified making appointments 
time reached pasha palace 
latter evidently considered visit ceremonious one guard honor drawn court yard saluted passed 
time pasha sir sidney exchanged compliments usual oriental style edgar translating speeches 
without brave sailors town would fallen first day french opened fire pasha said 
men thoroughly dispirited events jaffa tell truth absolutely despaired resistance left french arrived ships come bay 
jaffa much stronger place garrison men good heart fell first assault could done defences needed shot fall ruins garrison panic stricken believed enemy absolutely invincible troops could fought better towards end siege pasha 
way threw sabre hand upon french bayonets splendid sailors could fought better french entered town 
yes yes well beginning hearts water hundred french grenadiers could taken place 
hope return soon 
fancy little chance pasha unless hear three french frigates theseus chased days ago coast case may run across try catch 
certainly fear french coming news taken place cause excitement among egyptians bonaparte much maintain hold province 
shall take care justice soldiers sending report siege sultan sovereign ally whose service hold rank 
old pasha smiled 
rate sir sidney smith shall take care sultan shall send hither capture acre instead defending 
lesson troops formidable deemed shall reason complaint 
young gentlemen went turning midshipmen hear going sail one gun boats captured commander endeavor punish pirates much mischief trade among islands vessels trading ports others stamboul 
young sir rendered well sir sidney smith great service throughout siege interpreting us thus enabling understand wishes instead obliged learn might reported substance french 
likewise daily carried orders officers often heavy fire 
officer mine known recognize services 
could given much promotion custom army presented many purses 
power give promotion sir sidney smith tells british officer could receive gifts money even foreign monarch 
said however personal present token regard services rendered considers could accept present form jewel might think right offer 
took box turkish make stood table beside 
said aigrette worn battle appropriate present could made one seen standing unflinchingly fire might well appalled veterans 
turned wilkinson 
sir throughout siege service shore first part siege commanded little body sailors checked first attempt enemy capture tower 
saw fighting bravely terrible struggle breach nearly fell hands french 
therefore present ring honor similar requested sir sidney smith kindness give name officers distinguished greatly defense town 
edgar translated pasha speech opened box presented 
contained superb aigrette mounted upon brooch like ornament fastened turban 
ornament four inches diameter composed entirely precious stones emerald great size center 
looked sir sidney smith 
valuable altogether said 
take commander said smile showed morning 
edgar expressed thanks suitable terms pasha also wilkinson whose ring contained diamond great beauty sign sir sidney left room leaving conclude interview pasha alone 
quarter hour joined outside palace 
congratulate presents said 
blagrove undoubtedly valuable intended remain permanently service know could allowed accept 
see harm 
may tell pasha asked thought would remain service 
says knowledge several languages would much value like one whose courage well fidelity could rely 
told knew plans would probably leave navy soon french evacuated egypt knew anxious return parents england 
doubt mr blagrove would willing give terms could hardly hoped elsewhere pasha old man would object jealousy officers officials times guilty cruelties know would revolt position therefore would precarious one enemies might improbably endeavor remove formidable rival master favor assassination thought interest better take upon decline offer 
thank sir 
liked enter service 
would idle life well unpleasant one besides know father wishes take place alexandria 
djezzar behaved handsomely sir sidney said 
obtained list officers three ships petty officers specially distinguished 
given jewels hand officers name also purses money petty officers 
know immensely rich 
old fellow really grieved could offer anything said much pointed putting everything else aside would unheard thing commander chief sultan army receive present one however high rank orders 
insisted however exchange rings absolutely tears eyes spoke could refuse though mine signet ring crest diamond worth say thousand pounds worth penny 
time reached landing place 
lads part present hope prosperous cruise credit choice 
understand mr wilkinson remain station among islands receive orders 
seeing sir sidney two midshipmen took places boat rowed tigress 
unexpected piece luck blagrove wilkinson said started 
thought perhaps might make present seen every day besides interpreting carried orders officers heavy fire done sorts things except landed several times take part sorties lucky enough shore fight breach french got active work 
hopes getting anything beyond perhaps mention chief despatches 
feel quite ashamed much valuable present wilkinson 
oh sure one could begrudge wilkinson replied 
get special pay interpreter gives tremendous lot work besides going sir sidney constantly fire 
besides pasha saw great deal anyone else except chief 
congratulate upon heartily ever want turn money quite small fortune 
luckily father position make good allowance intention ever parting ring remembrance siege sort thing wear grand occasions 
found absence men worked hard except final scrub brig ship shape good order 
four clock morning crew deck still dark men set scrub decks said passed near tigre like decks look like trader ballast 
hour hard work finished look reported tigre men going aloft loosen sails 
light minutes canvas spread anchor catted 
tigre great sail spread yet way brig laid course west passed hundred yards stern 
tigress ran ensign sun showing dipped salute 
midshipmen waved hands comrades board saluted formally sir sidney stood bulwarks watching craft passed returned salute cheery shout well done tigress went course exchange cheer crews clustered bulwarks tigress tops man war 
fairly edgar said written instructions say go rhodes make inquiries port authorities outrages lately reported guided hear 
fact matter left entirely hands get 
know better divide watches 
would hardly thing skipper take watch yet would satisfactory way arranging 
could take gunner boatswain 
fact think would ridiculous work way 
like wilkinson doubt boatswain would well better 
take watch rate see petty officers get 
ticklish navigation among islands certainly feel comfortable neither deck 
tigre fairly way steering south west 
walking along breeze suits different craft overhauled laden pretty nearly covering board 
think breeze like tigre would able catch us although course wind strengthened much weight would tell 
however doubt craft fast 
hope ere long shall try speed one pirates 
expect wind big lateen sails fast wind would chance us 
get away rhodes disguise bit put yellow streak give look trader 
much likely find us find 
send prizes take small craft burn take would likely use chief blockade sell 
prisoners take hand pasha smyrna moslems greeks fewer prisoners take better 
would infinitely merciful shoot fair fight hand tender mercies turks sir sidney said would largely leave matter discretion 
would rather given positive orders writing subject awkward thing midshipman thing like left discretion especially times superior officers seem think midshipmen possess discretion whatever

sorry receipt order 
past month made two three captures craft small size well content give independent life return regular duty 
week later made tigre lying damietta mouth nile 
man war signalled anchor near 
soon wilkinson went board 
glad see back mr wilkinson sir sidney said cordially 
fully justified confidence energy discretion 
pashas write saying piracy seems completely suppressed two months since either received complaint vessel chased missing 
therefore wanted half enough ships work thought well recall 
craft seems went surveyed tigress glass good deal lower water yes sir nearly two feet half 
reported gained considerable amount booty astropalaia course added gradually never anything like good haul 
hold level main deck full 
full mr wilkinson miscellaneous cargo sir dried fruit manchester goods eastern goods sorts 
taken exact inventory sir generally pressed time thought things less likely damaged open bales 
really know exactly got certainly good deal silk quantity embroidered things 
sounds well anyhow sir sidney said smiling afraid turn well personally ought 
see craft prize tigre officers crew still borne books therefore although detached altogether independent work still rank tender tigre share indeed names sent list entitled share prizes made 
generally laden partly ammunition partly luxuries use army part valuable time calculate sum fifty sixty thousand pounds shared 
quite understood sir share tigre captured 
would bad addition luck independent cruise board tigress get advantage comrades way prize money 
told last report received twelve thousand five hundred pounds result sale thirty two craft sent smyrna rhodes 
gold thought would better send boat bring 
cargo sir must think mr wilkinson 
lost many hands hope away sir done hard fighting 
two men shot attack pirates hold astropalaia half crew wounded less seriously fortunately got 
satisfactory mr wilkinson 
giving full report work give list casualties case 
people admiralty seem idea credit affair depends largely size butcher bill whereas point fact exactly way unfrequently heavy loss means measures badly taken officers command whereas light one shows arrangements excellent work carried without hitch 
shall glad mr blagrove dine 
regular leave ship together signs whatever change wind one reckon certainty upon weather rate twenty four hours advance 
see change come fall glass mr blagrove must stay board 
wilkinson joined comrades gathered short distance away waiting finished talk sir sidney 
come wilkinson give us news 
heard taken prizes pirates want hear 
blagrove right soon gathered cockpit 
much time stay wilkinson said tell story want hear news beyond rumors current smyrna rhodes really know hardly anything taken place since left acre 
rather dull time one said excitement fight turks aided boats french 
returned found instead fifteen thousand strong promised turks board transports mustapha pasha five thousand strong raised seven thousand two thousand brought us acre 
th july landed attacked redoubt castle aboukir great pluck carried assault 
week later heard bonaparte ramanieh doubt turks would soon 
sir sidney tried hard get erect strong line works across spit ground fort stands 
done could assistance boats gun boats maintained ground 
chief set work endeavor get things shape 
chiflick regiment brought us acre posted village end spit 
turkish gun boats ordered take places directly assault began side isthmus sweep fire time came beggars would move arrive 
turks village attacked several times made magnificent defense 
helped guns much could could render little assistance 
last saw attack made earnest peremptory orders sent turkish gun boats go take stations boats went west side spit 
nothing could worse arrangements turks 
sent little provisions next water shore troops nearly half mad thirst half mutinous 
however moved forward village repulsed three attacks made french columns 
probably attacks would made beastly custom cutting heads fallen 
lots ran village infuriated french came rush entered village flying turks 
confusion terrible turks driven 
spit sand covered fugitives hundreds threw water swam us 
castle know little bit place crowded almost suffocation thousands could get 
fire boat guns kept french back time last turkish gun boats got position fall back make advances castle regular way 
unfortunately mustapha pasha taken village garrison one command still resisted two days surrendered almost mad thirst although spared much water could impossible us find sufficient six seven thousand extra men 
marines saved castle first day colonel douglas landing taking command restoring order turks fighting fiercely among got night managed send thousand ships 
whole business brought owing mustapha pasha acting accordance advice sir sidney sent act either damietta rosetta ships would station bay aboukir threaten alexandria french would care weaken force sending considerable number men act turks 
happened 
let us hear yarn 
wilkinson gave brief account trip tigress 
see said done much fighting indeed exception first scrimmage astropalaia scarcely said anything worth calling fighting 
picked lot small piratical craft destroyed majority sold others smyrna rhodes 
got altogether twelve thousand five hundred course shared tigre done pretty well share way earning prize money ship 
indeed tigre share prizes taken come fifteen twenty thousand outside 
besides got booty board tigress worth idea simply bundled things without opening anything 
still doubt enough give pounds head 
soon could get away wilkinson returned brig 
evening admiral table gave much detailed account doings done reports 
finished sir sidney smith said attack upon pirates hold extremely well managed mr wilkinson mr blagrove great credit 
brief account said considerable amount booty evidently taken plundered ships found concealed valuable portion shipped tigress 
come board morning bales brought main deck see 
dozen bales opened next day two contained european goods rest eastern manufactures silks embroideries turkish syrian persian carpets rugs 
enough sir sidney said 
roughly give idea proportion european goods dried fruits may call generally eastern goods twenty tons fruit sir thirty tons european bales fifty sixty tons eastern goods 
say two thirds carpets rugs could pretty well tell others size feel bales rest judging opened cloth female garments muslin silks scarves sashes embroidered goods 
extraordinary great collection could made 
great many vessels employed making sir may say pick least hundred perhaps several times number captured craft several sizes 
doubt pirates would cases put aside goods kind although use doubt difficult sell would store away idea time opportunity would occur turning money 
well doubt extremely rich prize 
afraid give even approximate calculation worth 
east indiamen bring valuable cargoes home doubt whether one ship ever carried much costly merchandise stored 
think best got england 
things require careful handling consigned ordinary prize agent might sold anyhow half value 
following day two midshipmen signalled come board tigre 
thinking matter gentlemen sir sidney said entered cabin 
power appoint prize agent england 
matter fact done 
coming diplomatic mission thought taking prizes 
picked simply sent agent gibraltar way one worst places one send vessels sold ridiculous prices 
ordinarily malta would port sent still possession french gibraltar port mediterranean 
course might sent england difficulty detaching men officers risk captured french privateers practically driven gibraltar 
course prize court disposal cargo write head court personal friend mine asking intrust sale eastern goods father mr blagrove saying years engaged trade east must therefore acquainted value things habit sending egyptian silks london sale must know channels could best disposed

among prizes taken smart brig size tigress 
caught making alexandria powder ball french army 
fortunately us captain first class navigator missed mark ten miles found consternation satisfaction close guns

mr blagrove buy name father take bill three months upon 
question crew 
officers send home mr wilkinson despatches 
opportunity forwarding weeks mr blagrove give three months leave urgent private business 
men small craft coming constantly sicily fruit fresh provisions doubt offer good wages would able pick ten twelve men without much difficulty 
board ships say least twenty men invalided boards doctors unfit service either effects wounds climate would good opportunity sending home 
many still fit easy work would rate counterbalance italian crew 
course formally take passage mr blagrove ship 
prize mounts six guns would advise keep well way french privateers 
course final result sale merchandise would paid father mr blagrove prize court division among entitled 
ship father property case different private venture 
course charge freight merchandise get two three pounds head taking invalids home 
certainly get double price brig would fetch gibraltar freight would good deal clear expenses course usual prize agent commission sales effects 
think plan midshipmen highly pleased proposal thanked commander heartily kindness 
board officers assembled following day assessed value french brig edgar formally bought father name sum drew bill upon payment three months 
several times heard since entered board tigre first letter mr blagrove gave hearty approval course adopted said year two sea would give thorough knowledge ships considerable advantage business 
receipt edgar first letter heavy budget containing account doings egypt day left behind sailed immense relief hitherto absolute ignorance taken place 
father however thought even according account run needless risk taking part rising cairo although saw time become thoroughly associated arabs would difficult avoid acting danger
