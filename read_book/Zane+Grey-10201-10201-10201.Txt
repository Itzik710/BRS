miss anderson evinced interest subject wanted know particular field identical others miles around promise magnificent crop others promise 
section lay fallow long time replied dorn 
snow lasted north slope quite 
father used method soil cultivation intended conserve moisture

rain next ten days section bluestem yield fifty bushels acre 
fifty bushels ejaculated anderson 
bluestem call green yellow queried girl

anderson tramped along edge field peering pulling shaft wheat examining 
girl gazed dreamy eyes across undulating sea 
dorn watched 
ranch thousands acres like said 
difference asked dorn 
appeared pensive doubt

know came dust dust return fields human father 
come speak language understand yet 
mean w hat see growing wheat field clods wind dust glare heat eternal sameness open space things around life centered go away content 
anderson came back young couple carrying heads wheat hand 
smut exclaimed showing diseased healthy specimens wheat 
hunt hard find 
smut bane wheat growers 
never saw little 
fact know scarcely nothin smut cure 
farmers raise grain got work science 
bluestem bearded wheat like turkey red 
beard anythin smut think 
parasite fungus lives inside wheat 
never heard 
wonder smut worst trouble wheat raisers northwest 
fields literally full smut 
never rid 
one farmer one idea one else another 
could greater importance farmer war 
men claim know say wheat win war 
lose millions bushels smut 
say terrible fact face 
like get ideas 
dorn happening glance miss anderson act seemed growing habitual read curiosity interest something direct blue eyes 
circumstance embarrassed though tugged flood gates knowledge 
could talk wheat like 
yet girl might supposed bored 
still appear 
warm glance politeness 
yes like hear every word say wheat said encouraging little nod 
sure would added anderson affectionate hand shoulder 
farmer daughter 
farmer wife 
laughed last sally 
girl blushed 
dorn smiled shook head doubtfully 
imagine good fortune never befall farmer said 
well replied archly consider might surprise knowledge wheat indeed mr dorn interested 
never bend desert wheat 
never felt greatness loving soil caring growing things seed 
yet bible teaches read bible 
please tell us 
say like 
dorn proof eloquence 
quoted two authorities heald woolman state agricultural experiment station studied two years 
bunt stinking smut caused two different species microscopic fungi live parasites wheat plant 
essentially similar effects life history 
tilletia tritici rough spored variety common stinking smut pacific regions tilletia foetans smooth spored species one generally found eastern united states 
smut berries balls infected head contain millions minute bodies spores seeds smut fungus 
reproduce smut somewhat way true seed develops new plant 
single smut ball average size contains sufficient number spores give one grain wheat five six bushels 
takes eight smut spores equal diameter human hair 
normal wheat grains infected field may many spores lodged surface give dark color grains show difference color naked eye may still contain sufficient number spores produce smutty crop seed treatment practiced 
living smut spores introduced soil seed wheat exist soil smut free wheat sown certain percentage wheat plants likely become infected 
smut spore germinates produces first stage smut plant soil 
first stage never infects young seedling direct gives rise secondary spores sporida infection threads may arise penetrate shoot young seedling reach growing point 
fungus threads keep pace growth plant reach maturity slightly harvest time 
since disease caused internal parasite natural expect certain responses presence 
noted first smut fungus living expense host plant wheat effect host may summarized follows consumption food destruction food sporulating process stimulating retarding effect normal physiological processes 
badly smutted plants remain many cases size produce fewer smaller heads 
fife bluestem varieties infected heads previous maturity exhibit darker green color remain green longer normal heads 
varieties infected heads stand erect normal ones begin droop result increasing weight ripening grain 
crop may become infected smut number different ways 
smut originally introduced seed many farmers still planting every season seed wheat 
wheat taken smutty crop countless numbers loose spores adhering grains also certain number unbroken smut balls 
always source danger even seed treated fungicides sowing 
also chances infection crop absolutely smut free seed employed 
first soil infection previous smutty crop second soil infection wind blown spores 
experiments shown separated spores crushed smut balls lose effective power two three months provided soil moist loose case survive winter 
seem probable wheat smut controlled single practice rather combined use various methods crop rotation use clean seed seed treatment fungicides cultural practices breeding selection varieties 
failure practice crop rotation undoubtedly one main explanations general prevalence smut wheat fields eastern washington 
even intervening summer fallow smut previous crop may source infection 
experience shows fall stubble crop less liable smut infection crop following summer fallow 
apparent explanation condition fact summer fallow becomes infected wind blown spores stubble crop wind blown spores well originating previous crop buried plowing 
clean seed properly treated seed used farmers never smut problem 
high per cents 
smut indicate either soil infection imperfect treatment 
principle chemical treatment use poison kill superficial spores smut materially injure germinating power seed 
hot water treatment recommended one chemical steeps effective 
certain cultural practices beneficial reducing amount smut cases value others depends extent upon source smut spores 
factors always influence amount smut temperature soil germinating period amount soil moisture depth seeding 
seed borne spores sources infection attention three factors mentioned give cultural practices reducing amount smut 
early seeding practiced various farmers report marked reduction smut 
replowing summer fallow first fall rains generally effective reducing amount smut 
late planting four five weeks first good fall rains also effective practice 
fall tillage summer fallow plowing seems beneficial 
smut immune varieties wheat known standard varieties show varying degrees resistance 
spring wheats generally suffer less smut winter varieties 
due superior resistance rather fact escape infection 
spring wheats grown smut problem would largely disappear return practice suggested since winter wheats much desirable 
seems probable conditions prevail growing season may considerable influence per cent smut given variety 
dorn finished discourse receive thanks listeners walked back yard toward road
