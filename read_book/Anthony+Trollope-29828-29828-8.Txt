moreover gave daughter hundred pounds notes morning wedding thus acted part benevolent father father law miracle 
may acknowledged receipt money removed heavy weight lord george heart 
poor time scrupulous lacked funds sufficient usual brightness wedding tour 
would take mother money lessen small patrimony seemed wealth showered deanery 
perhaps sojourn ireland well anything could towards assisting young wife object falling love husband

mary learned wished attend cathedral services interest respecting always done 
explained although kept horse ride dean brotherton wish seen hunting field 
dress ornaments books parties always something mark slightly clerical belongings 
never chafed loved father naturally obedient felt something perhaps soft regret 
father saw frequently never spoke duties 
house furnished way would lay london society enjoyments life could best secure seemed matters intent 
occurred speaking house london never asked church would attend spoke pleasure near abbey paid little attention remark 
felt rather perceived counsels almost intimated must plan life different husband instructions given almost seemed though implied 
took granted life gay bright though seemed take also granted lord george wish gay bright 
surprised 
perhaps surprise much serious view life husband day day impressed upon 
hero early dreams man light hair dimpled chin yet quite forgotten never scolded never spoken serious word always ready provide amusements never palled 
lord george made course reading much two hours breakfast much hour dressing much evening also table results acquired three months six months much close first year even laid sum total achievements produced dozen years work course determined would 
great object life love course really loved would comply wishes 
began daily hour gibbon breakfast great zeal 
present idea gibbon come father instigations amuse husband would better 
things surprised another matter vexed 
six weeks manor cross found ladies set tutors 
marchioness offended much three sisters law 
one family always liked best also liked best mr holdenough gone live next door father close 
lady alice though perhaps little tiresome always gentle good natured 
mother law much awe eldest daughter ever scold anyone 
lady sarah could severe lady susanna could stiff lady amelia always echoed elder sisters said 
lady sarah far worst 
forty years old looked though fifty wished thought sixty 
truth good one either manor cross brotherton parishes around ever doubted 
knew every poor woman estate finger making almost every petticoat worn 
spent next nothing giving away almost little income 
went church whatever weather 
never idle never wanted amused 
place carriage would naturally always surrendered one sisters five ladies manor cross surrendered brother wife 
spent hours daily parish school 
doctor surgeon poor people never sparing 
harsh looking harsh voice dictatorial 
poor people become used liked ways 
women knew stitches never gave way men wholesome confidence medicines plasters cookery

ritual indeed one point interest lady amelia life 
among assent enough daily comfort lord george respect respect trouble 
never declared openly seemed care much church

used like cathedral services lady sarah said one day mary declined go parish church sing praises st processus 
cathedral services said mary 
mean say attended house god music good mary thought subject sufficiently enabled say good music supplied object drawing large congregations shrugged shoulders 
like good music dear think want keep church 
mary shrugged shoulders remembering sister law know one tune another 
lady alice one family ever studied music 
even papa goes saints days continued lady sarah conveying sneer dean word even 
papa dean 
suppose go 
would go church suppose unless approved going 
subject dropped 
lady george yet arrived sort snarling home intimacy would justified telling lady sarah wanted lesson would prefer take husband 
poor women petticoats another source trouble 
autumn end october mary two months manor cross got acknowledge ladies living country employ part time making clothes poor people soon learned regret acknowledgment 
quickly driven corner assertion lady sarah case time employed defined 
intended make something perhaps entire petticoat future time 
lady sarah going put conduct 
mary acknowledged duty 
mean perform neglect made one petticoat gently appealed husband 
think petticoats could bought cheaper could made figured found wife could earn three halfpence day two hours work even lady sarah require two hours daily 
worth made miserable ninepence week less year lady george figured also offered exact sum lady sarah order might let first twelve months 
lady sarah full wrath 
spirit offerings made lord mary asked stern indignation whether bestowing work hands upon people whether fact poor distasteful recognize performance duty mary considered said thought petticoat petticoat perhaps one made regular petticoat maker would best 
allude grand doctrine division labor hint might harm good interfering regular trade studied matters 
line argument 
lady sarah told heart matter hard nether millstone 
young wife liking withdrew appealed husband 
mind divided subject 
clearly opinion petticoat obtained cheapest market doubted much three halfpence two hours 
might wife could better present experience would come case would obtaining experience well earning three halfpence 
moreover petticoats made manor cross would thought undoubtedly better could bought 
came however final decision mary finding every morning sitting great petticoat conclave hardly alternative join 
spirit complaint spoke subject father winter came 
certain old miss tallowax come deanery thought proper lady george spend day two 
miss tallowax also money even still owned share business dean pointed lord george wife would well civil 
lord george come last day dine sleep deanery 
occasion dean daughter alone together said something playful way great petticoat contest 
let old ladies sit upon said dean

thought george would see 
take part know 
course married woman entitled way unless wish otherwise 
want make matter serious pressed tell care spend time way 
cling old fashions 
natural enough absurd suppose make old fashioned 
taken matter quite seriously given daughter advice evidently intention profit 
said married woman struck forcibly 
doubt ladies manor cross superiors birth brother wife married woman rights 
little spirit rebellion already began kindle within bosom nothing mutiny husband 
desire make petticoats day course would make contest neutral certainly given orders 
thought good deal deanery made mind would sit petticoat conclave longer 
could duty pass time employment poor woman might difficulty earn sixpence day 
surely might better time even though spend reading gibbon

good thinking thing pretend virtuous like money 
mr houghton rate got large income 
fortune command say might done 
lady george almost felt ought offended almost felt disgusted time quite understand 
father made point asking houghtons told course would know houghtons town 
idea ignorant ways life would behove married woman learn ways 
perhaps free easy mode talking right thing 
like told another lady lady would married husband pauper offence seemed greater recent 
like told jealous especially remembered husband desperately love lady told many months ago 
jealous quite sure never would jealous perhaps matter 
occurred drawing room dinner 
mr houghton came telling commissioned dean honor taking dinner

therefore told miss tallowax mother hoped pleasure seeing manor cross left brotherton 
miss tallowax almost got seat curtseyed head shoulders proposition 
dean good man head dinner table party went pleasantly spite sundry attempts clerical pugnacity made mr groschut 
every man every beast weapon 
wolf fights tooth bull horn mr groschut always fought bishop taught inner instinct 
bishop according mr groschut inclined think might done 
change might advantageously made reference certain clerical meetings hilarity diocese might enhanced certain evangelical festivities 
remarks generally addressed mr canon holdenough made almost reply 
dean occasion prepared civil answer answer would still seem change conversation 
law close bishop barton never allowed interfere affairs brotherton cathedral bishop certainly bishop chaplain 
though canon dean go altogether fours reference clerical affairs generally agreed point 
chaplain knew condition affairs well thought law bad law determined abolish 
certainly would pleasant mr holdenough could meeting within confines close 
mean day mean morrow might think 
bishop greatest love cathedral services much mind 
know care much door gatherings said canon 
doors asked chaplain 
whatever meeting close hope held deanery said dean meetings must say like meetings best

believe generally held doors 
fancy considerable resemblance energy brought together said chaplain 
clergymen allowed hunt said mr houghton usual little dark subject consideration 
prevent asked canon never hunting life certainly would advised young clergyman abstain sport
