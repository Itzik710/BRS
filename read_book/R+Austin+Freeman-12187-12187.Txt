turned matter mind half unconsciously scrutinized visitor somewhat embarrassment liked appearance little liked mission 
kept station near door light dim illumination concentrated table patient chair could see somewhat sly unprepossessing face greasy red moustache seemed character rather perfunctory livery though mere prejudice

observations gave abundant food reflection 
mr weiss must excessively conscientious man considered promise mr graves committed extraordinary precautions 
evidently mere following letter law enough satisfy sensitive conscience 
unless reasons sharing mr graves unreasonable desire secrecy one could suppose measures concealment taken patient 
suggestions evolved consideration little disquieting 
whither carried purpose idea bound den thieves might robbed possibly murdered dismissed smile 
thieves make elaborately concerted plans rob poor devils like 
poverty compensations respect 
possibilities 
imagination backed experience difficulty conjuring number situations medical man might called upon without coercion either witness actively participate commission unlawful act 
reflections kind occupied pretty actively agreeably strange journey 
monotony relieved distractions

finished pipe knocked ashes heel boot carriage slowed entered covered way could tell hollow echoes 
distinguished clang heavy wooden gates closed behind moment two later carriage door unlocked opened 
stepped blinking covered passage paved cobbles apparently leading mews darkness time make detailed observations carriage drawn opposite side door open stood woman holding lighted candle 
doctor asked speaking rather pronounced german accent shading candle hand peered 
answered affirmative exclaimed glad come 
mr weiss relieved 
come please 
followed across dark passage dark room set candle chest drawers turned depart 
door however paused looked back 
nice room ask said 
untidy must excuse us 
much anxiety poor mr graves 
ill time yes 
little time 
intervals know 
sometimes better sometimes well 
spoke gradually backed passage go away 
accordingly pursued inquiries 
seen doctor answered always refused see doctor 
great trouble us 
mr weiss anxious 
glad hear come 
better go tell 
perhaps kindly sit able come departed mission 
struck little odd considering anxiety apparent urgency case mr weiss waiting receive 
several minutes elapsed without appearing oddness circumstance impressed still 
desire journey carriage sit whiled away time inspection room 
curious room bare dirty neglected apparently unused 
faded carpet flung untidily floor 
small shabby table stood middle room beyond three horsehair covered chairs chest drawers formed entire set furniture 
pictures hung mouldy walls curtains covered shuttered windows dark drapery cobwebs hung ceiling commemorate long illustrious dynasty spiders hinted months neglect disuse 
chest drawers incongruous article furniture seemed dining room nearest best lighted object received attention 
fine old chest nearly black mahogany battered last stage decay originally piece pretensions 
regretful fallen estate looked interest observed lower corner little label bearing printed inscription lot heard footsteps descending stairs 
moment later door opened shadowy figure appeared standing close threshold 
good evening doctor said stranger deep quiet voice distinct though strong german accent 
must apologize keeping waiting 
acknowledged apology somewhat stiffly asked mr weiss presume yes mr weiss 
good come far late night make objection absurd conditions poor friend imposed 
replied 
business go wanted business inquire private affairs patients 
true sir agreed cordially much obliged taking proper view case 
pointed friend reasonable man 
secretive rather suspicious nature 
inferred 
condition seriously ill ah said mr weiss want tell 
much puzzled 
nature illness complain makes complaints kind although obviously ill 
fact hardly ever half awake 
lies kind dreamy stupor morning night 
struck excessively strange means agreement patient energetic refusal see doctor 
asked never rouse completely oh yes mr weiss answered quickly rouses time time quite rational may gathered rather obstinate 
peculiar puzzling feature case alternation state stupor almost normal healthy condition 
perhaps better see judge 
rather severe attack 
follow please 
stairs rather dark 
stairs dark noticed without covering carpet even oil cloth footsteps resounded dismally empty house 
stumbled guide feeling way hand rail first floor followed room similar size one barely furnished though less squalid 
single candle farther end threw feeble light figure bed leaving rest room dim twilight 
mr weiss tiptoed chamber woman one spoken rose chair bedside quietly left room second door 
conductor halted looking fixedly figure bed called philip philip doctor come see 
paused moment two receiving answer said seems dozing usual 
go see make stepped forward bedside leaving mr weiss end room near door entered remained slowly noiselessly pacing backwards forwards semi obscurity 
light candle saw elderly man good features refined intelligent even attractive face dreadfully emaciated bloodless sallow 
lay quite motionless except scarcely perceptible rise fall chest eyes nearly closed features relaxed though actually asleep seemed dreamy somnolent lethargic state influence narcotic 
watched minute timing slow breathing watch suddenly sharply addressed name response slight lifting eyelids brief drowsy glance slowly subsided former position 
proceeded make physical examination 
first felt pulse grasping wrist intentional brusqueness hope rousing stupor 
beats slow feeble slightly irregular giving clear evidence needed generally lowered vitality 
listened carefully heart sounds distinct thin walls emaciated chest found nothing abnormal beyond feebleness uncertainty action 
turned attention eyes examined closely aid candle ophthalmoscope lens raising lids somewhat roughly expose whole irides 
submitted without resistance rather ungentle handling sensitive structures showed signs discomfort even brought candle flame within couple inches eyes 
extraordinary tolerance light easily explained closer examination pupils contracted extreme degree minutest point black visible center gray iris 
abnormal peculiarity sick man eyes 
lay back right iris sagged slightly towards center showing distinctly concave surface contrived produce slight quick movement eyeball perceptible undulatory movement could detected 
patient fact known tremulous iris condition seen cases crystalline lens extracted cure cataract become accidentally displaced leaving iris unsupported 
present case complete condition iris made clear ordinary extraction operation performed able closest inspection aid lens find trace less common needle operation 
inference patient suffered accident known dislocation lens led inference almost completely blind right eye 
conclusion indeed extent negatived deep indentation bridge nose evidently produced spectacles marks looked found behind ears corresponding hooks curl sides glasses 
spectacles fitted curl sides hook ears usually intended worn habitually agreed indentation nose deeper would accounted merely occasional use spectacles reading 
one eye useful single eye glass would answered purpose weight objection single eye glass worn constantly would much less convenient pair hook sided spectacles 
nature patient illness one opinion seemed possible 
clear typical case opium morphine poisoning 
conclusion symptoms seemed point absolute certainty 
coated tongue protruded slowly tremulously response command bawled ear yellow skin ghastly expression contracted pupils stupor could hardly roused roughest handling yet amount actual insensibility formed distinct coherent group symptoms pointing plainly nature drug also suggesting formidable dose 
conclusion turn raised awkward difficult question 
large poisonous dose drug taken dose administered closest scrutiny patient arms legs failed reveal single mark would made hypodermic needle 
man clearly common morphinomaniac absence usual sprinkling needlemarks nothing show suggest whether drug taken voluntarily patient administered someone else 
remained possibility might mistaken diagnosis 
felt pretty confident 
wise man always holds doubt reserve 
present case regard obviously serious condition patient doubt eminently disturbing 
indeed pocketed stethoscope took last look motionless silent figure realized position one extraordinary difficulty perplexity 
one hand suspicions aroused naturally enough unusual circumstances surrounded visit inclined extreme reticence evidently duty give information might prove serviceable patient 
turned away bed mr weiss stopped slow pacing fro faced 
feeble light candle fell saw distinctly first time 
impress favourably 
thick set round shouldered man typical fair german tow colored hair greased brushed smoothly large ragged sandy beard coarse sketchy features 
nose large thick bulbous end inclined reddish purple tint extended adjacent parts face color run 
eyebrows large beetling overhanging deep set eyes wore pair spectacles gave somewhat owlish expression 
exterior unprepossessing state mind rendered easily receptive unfavourable impression 
well said make hesitated still perplexed conflicting necessities caution frankness length replied think rather badly mr weiss 
low state 
yes see 
come decision nature illness tone anxiety suppressed eagerness question natural enough circumstances means allayed suspicions rather influenced side caution 
give definite opinion present replied guardedly 
symptoms rather obscure might well indicate several different conditions 
might due congestion brain explanation possible incline view 
alternative narcotic poison opium morphia 
quite impossible 
drug house never leaves room could get outside 
servants asked 
servants excepting housekeeper absolutely trustworthy 
might store drug aware 
left alone much seldom indeed 
spend much time able room mrs schallibaum housekeeper sits 
often drowsy oh often fact say usual condition 
rouses quite lucid natural perhaps hour presently becomes drowsy doses remains asleep half asleep hours end 
know disease takes people way answered 
symptoms exactly like disease known 
much like opium poisoning 
dear sir mr weiss retorted impatiently since clearly impossible opium poisoning must something else 
else speaking congestion brain 
yes 
objection complete recovery seems take place intervals 
would say complete said mr weiss 
recovery rather comparative 
lucid fairly natural manner still dull lethargic 
instance show desire go even leave room 
pondered uncomfortably rather contradictory statements 
clearly mr weiss mean entertain theory opium poisoning natural enough knowledge drug used 
still suppose said mr weiss experience sleeping sickness suggestion startled 

people 
time practically nothing known disease 
mere pathological curiosity almost unheard excepting practitioners remote parts africa hardly referred text books 
connection trypanosome bearing insects yet unsuspected symptoms absolutely unknown 
replied 
disease nothing name 
ask mr graves abroad yes 
traveling last three four years know spent time recently west africa disease occurs 
fact first heard 
new fact 
shook confidence diagnosis considerably inclined reconsider suspicions 
mr weiss lying decided disadvantage 
think asked 
possible sleeping sickness like say impossible replied 
disease practically unknown 
never practiced england occasion study 
looked subject position give opinion 
course could see mr graves one may call lucid intervals able form better idea 
think could managed might 
see importance certainly best difficult man difficult man 
sincerely hope sleeping sickness 
understood disease invariably fatal sooner later 
seem cure 
think able decide see hope replied 
shall look authorities see exactly symptoms far known impression little information available 
meantime give medicine attend general condition better let see soon possible 
say effect medicine might throw light patient condition proposed treat morphine poisoning thought wiser keep item information 
accordingly confined general directions care patient mr weiss listened attentively 
concluded must lose sight opium question 
better search room carefully keep close watch patient especially intervals wakefulness 
well doctor mr weiss replied tell send soon possible object poor graves ridiculous conditions 
allow pay fee go order carriage writing prescription 
need prescription said 
make medicine give coachman 
mr weiss seemed inclined demur arrangement reasons insisting 
modern prescriptions difficult read wish mr weiss know treatment patient 
soon left alone returned bedside looked impassive figure 
looked suspicions revived 
like morphine poisoning morphine common medicinal dose given 
opened bag took hypodermic case extracted little tube atropine tabloids 
shaking hand couple tiny discs drew patient lip slipped little tablets tongue 
quickly replaced tube dropped case bag hardly done door opened softly housekeeper entered room 
find mr graves asked thought unnecessarily low tone considering patient lethargic state 
seems ill answered 
rejoined added sorry hear 
anxious 
seated chair bedside shading candle patient face produced bag hung waist half finished stocking began knit silently skill characteristic german housewife 
looked attentively though much shadow could see indistinctly somehow appearance prepossessed little members household 
yet ill looking woman 
excellent figure air person good social position features good enough coloring although little unusual unpleasant 
like mr weiss fair hair greased parted middle brushed smoothly painted hair dutch doll 
appeared eyebrows owing doubt light color hair doll like character emphasized eyes either brown dark gray could see 
peculiarity consisted habit spasm one often sees nervous children periodical quick jerk head cap string dangling lock shaken cheek 
age judged thirty five 
carriage one might expected waiting seemed take time getting ready 
sat growing impatience listening sick man soft breathing click housekeeper knitting needles 
wanted get home sake patient condition made highly desirable remedies given quickly possible 
minutes dragged point expostulating bell rang landing 
carriage ready said mrs schallibaum 
let light stairs 
rose taking candle preceded head stairs stood holding light baluster rail descended crossed passage open side door 
carriage drawn covered way could see faint glimmer distant candle also enabled dimly discern coachman standing close shadow 
looked round rather expecting see mr weiss made appearance entered carriage 
door immediately banged locked heard heavy bolts gates withdrawn loud creaking hinges 
carriage moved slowly stopped gates slammed behind felt lurch coachman climbed seat started forward 
reflections return journey reverse agreeable 
could rid conviction involved suspicious proceedings 
possible course feeling due strange secrecy surrounded connection case made visit ordinary conditions might found patient symptoms nothing excite suspicion alarm 
might consideration comfort 
diagnosis might wrong 
might reality case brain affection accompanied compression slow hemorrhage abscess tumor simple congestion 
cases difficult times 
appearances one consistently agree symptoms accompanying conditions 
sleeping sickness perhaps hopeful suggestion could decide knowledge view weighty fact symptoms exactly agree theory morphine poisoning 
even conclusive evidence criminal act 
patient might confirmed opium eater symptoms heightened deliberate deception 
cunning unfortunates proverbial equalled secretiveness mendacity 
would quite possible man feign profound stupor long watched left alone minutes nip bed help secret store drug 
would quite character objection seeing doctor desire secrecy 
still believe true explanation 
spite various alternative possibilities suspicions came back mr weiss strange taciturn woman refused budge 
circumstances case suspicious 
elaborate preparations implied state carriage traveling make shift appearance house absence ordinary domestic servants although coachman kept evident desire mr weiss woman avoid thorough inspection persons fact former told deliberate lie 
lied beyond doubt

reflections interrupted stopping carriage 
door unlocked thrown open emerged dark stuffy prison opposite house 
let medicine minute two said coachman let latch key mind came back swiftly general circumstances case critical condition patient 
already regretting taken energetic measures rouse restore flagging vitality would terrible thing take turn worse die coachman returned remedies 
spurred alarming thought made medicines quickly carried hastily wrapped bottles man found standing horse head

coachman took packages without reply climbed seat touched horse whip drove rapid pace towards newington butts 
little clock consulting room showed close eleven time tired gp thinking bed 
sleepy 
frugal supper found taking anew thread meditations afterwards smoked last pipe expiring surgery fire strange sinister features case continued obtrude notice 
looked stillbury little reference library information subject sleeping sickness learned rare obscure disease little known present 
read morphine poisoning confirmed belief diagnosis correct would satisfactory circumstances different 
interest case merely academic 
position great difficulty responsibility decide course action 
ought maintain professional secrecy tacitly committed ought convey hint police suddenly singular feeling relief bethought old friend fellow student john thorndyke eminent authority medical jurisprudence 
associated temporarily one case assistant deeply impressed versatile learning acuteness marvellous resourcefulness 
thorndyke barrister extensive practice would able tell duty legal point view also doctor medicine would understand exigencies medical practice 
could find time call temple lay case doubts difficulties would resolved 
anxiously opened visiting list see kind day work store morrow 
heavy day even allowing one two extra calls morning yet doubtful whether would allow going far district eye caught near foot page name burton

prodigal returned polton exclaimed looking room 
dr jervis 
followed room found polton confidential servant laboratory assistant artificer general familiar setting tea tray small table 
little man shook hands cordially face crinkled sort smile one might expect see benevolent walnut 
often talked sir said 
doctor wondering yesterday coming back us 
coming back quite sense intended felt little guilty reserved confidences thorndyke ear replied polite generalities 
polton fetched tea pot laboratory made fire departed thorndyke subsided old respective arm chairs 
whence spring unexpected fashion colleague asked 
look making professional visits 

base operations lower kennington lane 
ah back old trail yes answered laugh old trail long trail trail always new 
leads nowhere thorndyke added grimly 
laughed heartily uncomfortable element truth friend remark experience bore complete testimony 
medical practitioner whose lack means forces subsist taking temporary charge men practices apt find passing years bring little gray hairs wealth disagreeable experience 
drop jervis indeed thorndyke resumed pause 
casual employment preposterous man class professional attainments 
besides engaged married charming girl yes know 
fool 
really amend ways 
necessary pocket pride let juliet advance money buy practice 
said thorndyke proper resolution 
pride reserve people going husband wife absurdity 
buy practice forgotten proposal ungrateful brute 
well

going say yes 
believe answered without emotion rejoiced offer grateful tell 
must leave final arrangements next meeting week hope back hour want consult matter importance 
well said thorndyke leave formal agreement consideration next meeting 
want opinion fact said rather awkward dilemma want tell think ought 
thorndyke paused act refilling cup glanced unmistakable anxiety 
nothing unpleasant nature hope said 
nothing kind answered smile interpreted euphemism something unpleasant case young reasonably presentable medical man ordinarily equivalent trouble female species 
nothing concerns personally continued question professional responsibility 
better give account affair complete narrative know like data regular consecutive order 
thereupon proceeded relate history visit mysterious mr graves omitting single circumstance detail could recollect 
thorndyke listened beginning story closest attention 
face impassive ever seen ordinarily inscrutable bronze mask knew intimately certain something change color perhaps additional sparkle eye told curious passion investigation fully aroused 
told weird journey strange secret house brought could see offered problem heart 
whole narration sat motionless statue evidently committing whole story memory detail detail even finished remained appreciable time without moving speaking 
length looked 
extraordinary affair jervis said 
agreed question agitating done yes said meditatively question uncommonly difficult question 
really involves settlement antecedent question happening house think happening house asked 
must go slow jervis replied 
must carefully separate legal tissues medical avoid confusing know suspect 
reference medical aspects case 
first question confronts us sleeping sickness negro lethargy sometimes called difficulty 
enough knowledge 
neither us take ever seen case extant descriptions inadequate 
know disease symptoms agree case respect alleged moroseness gradually increasing periods lethargy alternating periods apparent recovery 
hand disease said confined negroes probably means negroes alone hitherto exposed conditions produce 
important fact far know extreme contraction pupils symptom sleeping sickness 
sum probabilities sleeping sickness insufficient knowledge definitely exclude 
think may really sleeping sickness personally entertain theory moment 
considering evidence apart opinions subject 
accept conceivable hypothesis may sleeping sickness positively prove 

come hypothesis morphine poisoning case different 
symptoms agree morphine poisoning every respect 
exception disagreement whatever 
common sense matter therefore adopt morphine poisoning working diagnosis seem done 
yes 
purposes treatment 
exactly 
medical purposes adopted probable view dismissed less probable 
reasonable thing 
legal purposes must entertain possibilities hypothesis poisoning involves serious legal issues whereas hypothesis disease involves legal issues 
sound helpful remarked 
indicates necessity caution retorted 
yes see 
opinion case well said let us consider facts order 
man assume influence poisonous dose morphine 
question take dose administered person took object take history given seems completely exclude idea suicide 
patient condition seems equally exclude idea morphinomania 
opium eater reduce state coma 
usually keeps well within limits tolerance established 
conclusion emerges think drug administered person likely person seems mr weiss 
morphine unusual poison inconvenient except single fatal dose reason rapidity tolerance drug established 
must forget slow morphine poisoning might eminently suitable certain cases 
manner enfeebles confuses judgment debilitates body might make useful poisoner whose aim get instrument document executed deed assignment 
death could produced afterwards means 
see important bearing mean respect death certificate yes 
suppose mr weiss given large dose morphine 
sends throws suggestion sleeping sickness 
accept suggestion pretty safe 
repeat process kills victim get certificate cover murder 
quite ingenious scheme way characteristic intricate crimes subtle criminal often plans crime like genius generally executes like fool man seems done injustice 
acted like fool several respects 
first place chosen doctor 
good brisk confident man knows mind sort person would suited man would jumped diagnosis stuck else ignorant weakling alcoholic tendencies 
shockingly bad luck run cautious scientific practitioner like learned friend 
course secrecy sheer tomfoolery exactly calculated put careful man guard actually done 
mr weiss really criminal mismanaged affairs badly 
apparently think criminal suspect deeply 
like ask one two questions 
say spoke german accent 
command english vocabulary good use german idioms 
say english perfect noticed phrases quite well chosen even englishman 
seem made way disguised mean say 
light feeble 
see color eyes instance 
think gray sure 
coachman 
wore wig said 
could see color eyes peculiarity could recognize malformed thumb nail right hand 
say 
strike resembling weiss way voice features spoke told distinct scotch accent 
reason ask weiss attempting poison man coachman almost certain confederate might relative 
better examine closely get another chance 

brings back question ought report case police inclined think 
hardly enough facts 
course mr weiss administered poison unlawfully maliciously committed felony liable consolidation acts ten years penal servitude 
see could swear information 
know administered poison poison really administered give reliable name address whatever 
question sleeping sickness 
reject medical purposes could swear court law case sleeping sickness 
admitted could 
think police would decline move matter might find raised scandal dr stillbury practice purpose 
think better nothing matter present 
course medical man duty assist justice way possible 
doctor detective go way assume police functions 
keep eyes ears open though general keep counsel duty note carefully anything seems likely bear important legal issues 
business officiously initiate criminal inquiries emphatically business ready called upon assist justice information special knowledge opportunities rendered accessible 
see bearing mean note seen heard say nothing asked 
yes nothing happens 
sent think duty make observations view necessary informing police 
may instance vital importance identify house duty secure means 
dear thorndyke expostulated told conveyed house

ill dying mrs schallibaum voice low eager intense 
turned finger patient wrist looked face thoroughly scared woman ever seen 
made attempt avoid light looked squarely face noticed half unconsciously eyes brown curious strained expression 
yes answered ill 
great danger 
still stared fixedly seconds 
odd thing occurred 
suddenly squinted squinted horribly familiar convergent squint burlesque artists imitate external divergent squint extreme near sight unequal vision

one moment eyes looking straight mine next one rolled round looked uttermost corner leaving gazing steadily forward 
evidently conscious change turned head away quickly reddened somewhat

want tumbler water 
brought water bottle glass wash stand groan despair hurried room 
lost time applying remedies hand 
shaking tumbler crystals potassium permanganate filled water approached patient 
stupor profound 
shook roughly safe depressed condition elicited resistance responsive movement 
seemed doubtful whether capable swallowing dared take risk pouring liquid mouth fear suffocating 
stomach tube would solved difficulty course one 
however mouth speculum also acted gag propped patient mouth open hastily slipped one rubber tubes stethoscope inserted one end vulcanite ear speculum serve funnel 
introducing end tube gullet far length would permit cautiously poured small quantity permanganate solution extemporized funnel 
great relief movement throat showed swallowing reflex still existed thus encouraged poured tube much fluid thought wise administer one time

taking hypodermic case bag prepared syringe full dose atropine sulphate injected forthwith unconscious man arm 
could far remedies concerned coffee arrived 
cleaned put away syringe washed tube returning bedside endeavored rouse patient profound lethargy 
great care necessary 
little injudicious roughness handling thready flickering pulse might stop ever yet almost certain speedily aroused stupor would gradually deepen shaded imperceptibly death 
went work cautiously moving limbs flicking face chest corner wet towel tickling soles feet otherwise applying stimuli strong without violent 
occupied efforts resuscitate mysterious patient notice opening door something start happening glance round perceived farther end room shadowy figure man relieved two spots light reflected spectacles 
long watching say saw observed came forward though far saw mr weiss

horrify exaggerating 
agitation stepped forward lighter part room could see face pale ghastliness except nose adjacent red patches cheeks stood grotesquely hideous contrast 
presently however recovered little said really think least hope take unnecessarily serious view condition

dear sir exclaimed thing impossible told watched continuously judge appearances find answered seeing offer fresh objections continued let us waste precious time discussion mr graves may dead reached conclusion 
hurry coffee asked time ago take necessary measures perhaps may manage pull round 
rather brutal decision manner evidently daunted 
must plain prepared accept explanation unconscious man condition morphine poisoning whence inference pretty plain alternatives recovery inquest 
replying stiffly must thought best hurried room leaving continue efforts without interruption 
time efforts seemed make impression 
man lay still impassive corpse excepting slow shallow rather irregular breathing ominous accompanying rattle 
presently imperceptible degrees signs returning life began make appearance 
sharp slap cheek wet towel produced sensible flicker eyelids similar slap chest followed slight gasp 
pencil drawn sole foot occasioned visible shrinking movement looking eyes detected slight change told atropine beginning take effect 
encouraging far quite satisfactory though would premature rejoice 
kept patient carefully covered maintained process gentle irritation moving limbs shoulders brushing hair generally bombarding deadened senses small repeated stimuli 
treatment improvement continued far bawling question ear actually opened eyes instant though another moment lids sunk back former position

something kind must happened 
preoccupied condition patient professional habit rapid close observation caused direct searching glance man 
brief glance mr weiss perhaps embarrassed keen regard almost immediately withdrew shadow attention seemed principally occupied odd contrast pallor face redness nose peculiar stiff bristly character eyebrows

legally speaking case ghost one 
client wished take opinion agreed bare chance might detect point overlooked 
think gone case thoroughly still infinitesimal chance may well take 
would like read two wills shall first explain circumstances think replied thorndyke narrative events order occurrence would helpful 
like know much possible testator examine documents 
well said marchmont 
begin recital circumstances briefly stated client stephen blackmore son mr edward blackmore deceased 
edward blackmore two brothers survived john elder jeffrey younger 
jeffrey testator case 
two years ago jeffrey blackmore executed made nephew stephen executor sole legatee months later added codicil giving two hundred fifty pounds brother john 
value estate thorndyke asked 
three thousand five hundred pounds invested consols 
testator pension foreign office lived leaving capital untouched 
soon made left rooms jermyn street lived years stored furniture went florence 
thence moved rome venice places italy continued travel end last september appears returned england beginning october took set chambers new inn furnished things old rooms 
far make never communicated friends excepting brother fact residence new inn england became known died 
quite accordance ordinary habits thorndyke asked 
say quite blackmore answered 
uncle studious solitary man formerly recluse 
much correspondent kept sort communication friends 
used instance write sometimes came cambridge vacations stay rooms 
anything known accounts change habits yes replied marchmont 
shall come presently 
proceed narrative fifteenth last march found dead chambers recent discovered dated twelfth november last year 
change taken place circumstances testator account new appreciable alteration disposition property 
far make new drawn idea stating intentions testator greater exactness sake away codicil 
entire property exception two hundred fifty pounds bequeathed stephen separate items specified testator brother john blackmore named executor residuary legatee 
see said thorndyke 
client interest would appear practically unaffected change 
yes 
exclaimed lawyer slapping table add emphasis words 
pity people knowledge law would refrain tinkering wills world trouble would saved oh come said thorndyke 
lawyer say 
suppose marchmont agreed 
see like muddle made side 
case muddle side 
change say seems leave friend stephen interests unaffected 
course poor jeffrey blackmore thought 
mistaken 
effect change absolutely disastrous 
indeed yes 
said alteration testator circumstances taken place time new executed 
two days death sister mrs edmund wilson died proved appeared bequeathed entire personalty estimated thirty thousand pounds 
heigho exclaimed thorndyke 
unfortunate affair right said mr marchmont disaster 
original great sum would accrued friend mr stephen whereas course goes residuary legatee mr john blackmore 
makes even exasperating fact obviously accordance wishes intentions mr jeffrey clearly desired nephew inherit property 
yes said thorndyke think justified assuming 
know whether mr jeffrey aware sister intentions think 
executed recently third september last seems communication mr jeffrey since date 
besides consider mr jeffrey actions see suggest knowledge expectation important bequest 
man make elaborate dispositions regard three thousand pounds leave sum thirty thousand disposed casually residue estate 
thorndyke agreed 
said manifest intention testator leave bulk property mr stephen 
may take virtually certain mr jeffrey knowledge fact beneficiary sister 
yes said mr marchmont think may take nearly certain 
reference second said thorndyke suppose need ask whether document examined mean genuine document perfectly regular mr marchmont shook head sadly 
said sorry say possible doubt authenticity regularity document 
circumstances executed establish genuineness beyond question 
circumstances thorndyke asked 
morning twelfth november last mr jeffrey came porter lodge document hand 
said 
want witness signature 
would mind find another respectable person act second witness happened nephew porter painter trade work inn 
porter went fetched lodge two men agreed witness signature 
better read said mr jeffrey 
actually necessary additional safeguard nothing private nature document 
two men accordingly read document mr jeffrey signed presence affixed signatures may add painter left recognizable impressions three greasy fingers 
witnesses examined yes 
sworn document signatures painter recognized finger marks 
said thorndyke seems dispose pretty effectually question genuineness gather mr jeffrey came lodge alone question undue influence disposed 
yes said mr marchmont 
think must pass absolutely flawless 
strikes rather odd said thorndyke jeffrey known little sister intentions 
explain mr blackmore think remarkable stephen replied 
knew little aunt affairs think uncle jeffrey knew much impression life interest husband property 
may right 
clear money left uncle 
taciturn woman made confidences anyone 
possible said thorndyke may acquired money recently bequest quite possible stephen answered 
died understand said thorndyke glancing notes jotted two days mr jeffrey 
date would jeffrey died fourteenth march said marchmont 
mrs wilson died twelfth march marchmont replied thorndyke asked die suddenly replied stephen died cancer 
understand cancer stomach 
happen know thorndyke asked sort relations existed jeffrey brother john one time said stephen know cordial breach may made later though know actually 
ask question said thorndyke dare say noticed first hint improved relations 
originally drawn makes mr stephen sole legatee 
little later codicil added favor john showing jeffrey felt necessity making recognition brother 
seems point change relations question arises change actually occur beginning new improving state feeling two brothers facts bearing question marchmont pursed lips air man considering unwelcome suggestion moments reflection answered think must say yes 
undeniable fact jeffrey friends john blackmore one knew living new inn 
oh john knew yes certainly came evidence called jeffrey chambers 
denying 
mark mr marchmont added emphatically cover inconsistency 
nothing second suggest jeffrey intended materially increase bequest brother 
quite agree marchmont 
think perfectly sound position 
suppose fully considered question whether would possible set aside second ground fails carry evident wishes intentions testator yes 
partner winwood went question carefully also took counsel opinion sir horace barnaby opinion court would certainly uphold 
think would view said thorndyke especially told 
understand john blackmore person knew jeffrey residence new inn one private friends 
bankers knew officials drew pension 
course would notify bankers change address 
yes course 
propos bank may mention manager tells late noticed slight change character jeffrey signature think see reason change hear rest story 
trifling commonly occurs man begins grow old especially failure eyesight 
mr jeffrey eyesight failing asked thorndyke 
yes undoubtedly said stephen 
practically blind one eye last letter ever mentioned signs commencing cataract 
spoke pension 
continued draw regularly yes drew allowance every month rather bankers drew 
accustomed abroad authorities seem allowed practice continue 
thorndyke reflected running eye notes slips paper hand marchmont surveyed malicious smile 
presently latter remarked methinks learned counsel floored 
thorndyke laughed 
seems retorted proceedings rather like amiable individual offered bear flint pebble might crack extract kernel 
confounded seems offer soft spot one could commence attack 
give

marchmont turned bundle papers smiled grimly 
dear thorndyke said none evidence slightest bearing case

reason believe affairs way embarrassed reason making away failing eyesight regard state mind last saw surprised happened 
substance john blackmore evidence mr stephen statement merely sets forth fact identified body uncle jeffrey 
think facts 
anything want ask go must really run away like said thorndyke know little parties concerned affair 
perhaps mr stephen give information 
expect said marchmont rate knows 
happen think way continued sly smile upsetting let know lose time entering caveat 
good bye trouble let 
soon gone thorndyke turned stephen blackmore 
going said ask questions may appear rather trifling must remember methods inquiry concern persons things rather documents 
instance gathered completely sort person uncle jeffrey 
could tell little shall tell stephen asked slightly embarrassed air 
well begin personal appearance 
rather difficult describe said stephen 
medium sized man five feet seven fair slightly gray clean shaved rather spare slight gray eyes wore spectacles stooped little walked 
quiet gentle manner rather yielding irresolute character health robust though infirmity disease excepting bad eyesight 
age fifty five 
came civil service pensioner fifty five asked thorndyke 
oh accident 
nasty fall horse rather nervous man shock severe 
time complete wreck 
failure eyesight actual cause retirement 
seems fall damaged eyes way fact practically lost sight one right moment good eye accident left vision much impaired 
first given sick leave allowed retire pension 
thorndyke noted particulars said uncle referred man studious habits 
mean pursued particular branch learning yes 
enthusiastic oriental scholar 
official duties taken one time yokohama tokio another bagdad places gave good deal attention languages literature arts countries 
also greatly interested babylonian assyrian archaeology believe assisted time excavations birs nimroud 
indeed said thorndyke 
interesting 
idea man considerable attainments 
facts mentioned mr marchmont would hardly led one think seems scholar distinction 
know mr marchmont realized fact said stephen would considered moment 
far goes course experience legal matters 
never tell beforehand said thorndyke facts may turn moment best collect get 
way aware uncle opium smoker 
knew opium pipe brought came home japan thought curio 
remember telling tried puffs opium pipe found rather pleasant though gave headache 
idea contracted habit fact may say utterly astonished fact came inquest 
thorndyke made note answer said think ask uncle jeffrey 
mr john blackmore 
sort man afraid tell much 
saw inquest met since boy 
different kind man uncle jeffrey different appearance different character 
would say two brothers physically quite unlike well said stephen know ought say 
perhaps exaggerating difference 
thinking uncle jeffrey saw last uncle john appeared inquest 
different 
jeffrey thin pale clean shaven wore spectacles walked stoop 
john shade taller shade greyer good eyesight healthy florid complexion brisk upright carriage distinctly stout wears beard moustache black slightly streaked gray 
looked unlike two men could though features really type indeed heard said young men rather alike resembled mother 
doubt difference character 
jeffrey quiet serious studious whereas john rather inclined called fast life used frequent race meetings think gambled good deal times 
profession would difficult tell many versatile 
believe began life articled pupil laboratory large brewery soon left went stage 
seems remained profession years touring country making occasional visits america 
life seemed suit believe decidedly successful actor 
suddenly left stage blossomed connection bucket shop london 
inquest described stockbroker presume still connected bucket shop 
thorndyke rose taking reference shelves list members stock exchange turned leaves 
yes said replacing volume must outside broker 
name list members house 
tell easy understand great intimacy two brothers without assuming kind ill feeling 
simply little common 
know anything 
never heard actual quarrel disagreement 
impression get well may think due terms especially first 
certainly seek one another society 
conclusive said thorndyke 
thrifty man usually much inclined bequeath savings gentleman may probably employ merry little flutter turf stock exchange 
clearly suitable subject legacy life 
mere speculation matter much importance far see 
tell john blackmore relations mrs wilson 
gather left bulk property jeffrey younger brother 
yes 
left nothing john 
fact hardly speaking terms 
believe john treated rather badly rate thought 
mr wilson late husband dropped money investment connection bucket shop spoke think suspected john let 
may mistaken know ladies get idea heads 
know aunt well slightly 
lived devonshire saw little us 
taciturn strong minded woman quite unlike brothers 
seems resembled father family 
might give full name 
julia elizabeth wilson 
husband name edmund wilson 
thank 
one point 
happened uncle chambers new inn since death remained shut 
effects left taken tenancy present avoid disturbed 
thought keeping use think could live seen 
inspected yes looked 
went day inquest 
tell looked rooms kind impression convey uncle habits mode life stephen smiled apologetically 
afraid said convey particular impression respect 
looked sitting room saw old familiar household gods went bedroom saw impression bed corpse lain gave sensation horror came away 
appearance rooms must conveyed something mind thorndyke urged 
afraid 
see analytical eye 
perhaps would like look would pray 
chambers 
think like glance round thorndyke replied 
well said stephen 
give card look lodge presently tell porter hand key whenever like look rooms 
took card case written lines handed thorndyke 
good said take much trouble 
like mr marchmont expectation result efforts grateful going case thoroughly 
suppose see possibility upsetting may ask question present replied thorndyke 
carefully weighed every fact connected case whether seems bearing shall refrain expressing even entertaining opinion either way 
stephen blackmore took leave thorndyke collected papers containing notes neatly punched couple holes margins inserted small file slipped pocket 
said nucleus body data investigations must based much fear receive great additions 
think jervis case looks hopeless case could look replied 
think said reason ordinarily keen making something 
much hope marchmont shall squeeze case dry bone let go 
going attend meeting board directors griffin life office 
shall walk good offer jervis think go alone 
want run notes get facts case arranged mind 
done shall ready pick new matter 
knowledge use unless actually mind produced moment notice 
better get book pipe spend quiet hour fire assimilate miscellaneous mental feast enjoyed 
might little rumination 
thorndyke took departure adopting advice drew chair closer fire filled pipe 
discover inclination read 
curious history heard thorndyke evident determination elucidate disposed meditation 
moreover subordinate business occupy affairs 
wherefore stirred fire got pipe well alight abandoned renewed consideration facts relating jeffrey blackmore 
chapter vii cuneiform inscription surprise thorndyke proceedings usually occasioned especially lawyers principally due think friend habit viewing occurrences unusual standpoint 
look things quite men looked 
prejudices knew conventions 
men cocksure thorndyke doubtful 
men despaired entertained hopes thus happened would often undertake cases rejected contemptuously experienced lawyers would bring successful issue 
thus case personally associated called red thumb mark case 
presented apparent impossibility given careful consideration 
category impossible brought possible merely possible actually probable probable certain end case triumphantly 
conceivable could make anything present case declined 
certainly entertained probably thinking moment 
yet could anything impossible case man making probably writing bringing voluntarily certain place executing presence competent witnesses 
suggestion compulsion even influence persuasion 
testator admittedly sane responsible give effect wishes however could proved due carelessness drafting unusual circumstances 
problem thorndyke seemed considering set aside 
reviewed statements heard turn would could get nothing confirmation mr marchmont estimate case 
one fact noted curiosity considered thorndyke evident desire inspect jeffrey blackmore chambers 
true shown eagerness seen time questions put stephen put expectation eliciting information purpose getting opportunity look rooms 
still cogitating subject colleague returned followed watchful polton tea tray attacked forthwith 
well thorndyke said thinking blackmore case gadding 
may take problem solved hanged may 
make nothing 
much position 
make nothing undertake undertook think said thorndyke 
never reject case hand unless obviously fishy 
surprising difficulties even impossibilities dwindle look attentively 
experience taught unlikely case least worth thinking 
way want look jeffrey chambers expect find expectations 
simply looking stray facts 
questions asked stephen blackmore nothing mind definite purpose purpose beyond getting know much case 
exclaimed mean going examine rooms without definite object say replied thorndyke 
legal case 
let put analogous medical case within present sphere 
supposing man consult say progressive loss weight 
give explanation 
pain discomfort symptoms kind short feels perfectly well every respect losing weight continuously 
would overhaul thoroughly answered 
would expect find know start expecting find anything particular 
overhaul organ organ function function could find nothing abnormal give 
exactly said thorndyke 
position line action 
case perfectly regular straightforward excepting one respect 
single abnormal feature 
abnormality nothing account 
jeffrey blackmore made 
well drawn apparently gave full effect intentions 
revoked made another 
change occurred circumstances intentions 
provisions new believed identical old one 
new differed old one defect drafting first free must unaware 
revoke first replace another believed identical provisions answer question 
abnormal feature case 
must explanation abnormality business discover 
facts possession yield explanation 
therefore purpose search new facts may give starting point investigation 
exposition thorndyke proposed conduct case reasonable impress convincing 
found coming back marchmont position really nothing dispute 
matters claimed attention moment dinner colleague reverted subject 
like take turn round new inn evening asked 
thought said would better go daylight 
old chambers usually well illuminated 
well thought said thorndyke 
better take lamp us 
let us go laboratory get one polton 
need said pocket lamp lent overcoat pocket 
put return 
occasion use asked 
yes 
paid another visit mysterious house carried plan 
must tell later 

shall keenly interested hear adventures 
plenty candle left lamp oh yes 
used hour 
let us said thorndyke accordingly set forth quest went reflected apparent vagueness proceedings 
presently reopened subject thorndyke 
imagine said absolutely nothing view 
going place defined purpose whatever 
say exactly replied thorndyke 
said going look particular thing fact 
going hope may observe something may start new train speculation 

know investigation follows certain logical course 
begins observation conspicuous facts 
done 
facts supplied marchmont 
next stage propose oneself one provisional explanations hypotheses 
done least suppose 
said jeffrey made change form foggiest idea 
like hear provisional theories subject 
hear present 
mere wild conjectures 
resume next go new inn rake deceased gentleman apartments 
thorndyke smilingly ignored answer continued examine explanation turn see follows whether agrees facts leads discovery new ones hand disagrees facts leads us absurdity 
let us take simple example 
suppose find scattered field number largish masses stone entirely different character rocks found neighborhood 
question arises stones get field three explanations proposed 
one products former volcanic action two brought distance human agency three carried thither distant country icebergs 
explanations involves certain consequences 
stones volcanic state fusion 
find unaltered limestone contain fossils 
volcanic 
borne icebergs part glacier probably show flat surfaces parallel scratches found glacier borne stones 
examine find characteristic scratched surfaces 
probably brought place icebergs 
exclude human agency might brought men place icebergs deposited 
comparison facts would needed 
proceed cases like present one 
facts known us invent certain explanations 
explanations deduce consequences consequences agree new facts confirm explanation whereas disagree tend disprove 
destination 
turned wych street arched passage leading new inn halting half door lodge perceived stout purple faced man crouching fire coughing violently 
held hand intimate fully occupied moment accordingly waited paroxysm subside 
length turned towards us wiping eyes inquired business 
mr stephen blackmore said thorndyke given permission look chambers 
said would mention matter 
sir said porter taken key go chambers 
walk across inn find farther side number thirty one second floor 
made way across house indicated ground floor occupied solicitor offices distinguished good sized brass plate 
although dark time light lower stairs encountered first floor landing man lit lamp 
thorndyke halted address 
tell occupies chambers third floor third floor empty three months reply 
going look chambers second floor said thorndyke 
pretty quiet quiet exclaimed man 
lord bless place like cemetery deaf dumb 
solicitors ground floor architects first floor 
clear six gone house empty blown hegg 
wonder poor mr blackmore made away self 
livin alone must like robinson crusoe without man friday even blooming goat talk 
quiet quiet enough want 
good 
contemptuous shake head turned retired next flight echoes footsteps died away resumed ascent 
would appear thorndyke commented jeffrey blackmore came home last evening house empty 
arrived second floor landing confronted solid looking door lintel deceased man name painted white lettering still looked new fresh 
thorndyke knocked door opened stephen blackmore 
wasted time taking advantage permission see colleague said entered 
indeed said stephen prompt 
rather wondering kind information expect gather inspection rooms 
thorndyke smiled genially amused doubt similarity stephen remarks mine recently criticized 
man science mr blackmore said expects nothing 
collects facts keeps open mind 
mere legal autolycus snapper unconsidered trifles evidence 
accumulated facts arrange compare think 
sometimes comparison yields new matter sometimes case believe capital error decide beforehand data sought 
yes suppose said stephen though almost looks mr marchmont right nothing investigate 
thought consulted laughed thorndyke 
engaged look case shall said shall keep open mind facts possession 
glanced round sitting room entered continued fine dignified old rooms 
seems sin covered oak panelling carved cornice mantel paint 
think must like beautiful figured wood exposed 
would dark stephen observed 
yes thorndyke agreed suppose care light less beauty ancestors 
tell looking round rooms convey similar impression old rooms general character quite think 
course rooms jermyn street different kind house beyond seem feel certain difference rather odd seeing furniture 
old rooms cosy homelike 
find something rather bare cheerless almost going say squalid look chambers 
rather expected said thorndyke 
opium habit alters man character profoundly somehow apart mere furnishing room reflects subtle way distinctly personality occupant especially occupant lives solitary life 
see evidences activities used occupy uncle much replied stephen 
place may quite left 
found one two books table put back shelves found manuscript notes used make 
noticed ink slab used keep scrupulously clean covered dry smears stick ink cracked end used months 
seems point great change habits 
used chinese ink thorndyke asked 
corresponded native friends japan used write japanese character even understood english 
chiefly used chinese ink 
also used copy inscriptions things 
stephen lifted mantelpiece looked like fossil bath bun actually clay tablet covered minute indented writing 
uncle could read cuneiform character yes something expert 
tablets believe leases legal documents eridu babylonian cities 
used copy inscriptions cuneiform writing translate english 
stay longer engagement evening 
dropped get two volumes thornton history babylonia advised read 
shall give key better leave porter go 
shook hands us walked landing stood watching ran stairs 
glancing thorndyke light gas lamp landing thought detected impassive face almost imperceptible change expression already alluded indicating pleasure satisfaction 
looking quite pleased remarked 
displeased replied calmly 
autolycus picked crumbs small ones still crumbs 
doubt learned junior picked likewise shook head inwardly suspected rather thick head 
perceive anything least degree significant stephen telling said interesting seem bearing uncle 
referring stephen told us although say interesting 
talking looking room seen strange thing 
let show 
linked arm mine walking back room halted opposite fire place 
said look 
remarkable object 
illustration inverted inscription 
followed direction gaze saw oblong frame enclosing large photograph inscription weird cabalistic arrow head character 
looked silence seconds somewhat disappointed remarked see anything remarkable circumstances 
ordinary room would admit stephen told us uncle something expert cuneiform writing 
exactly said thorndyke 
point 
makes remarkable 
follow said man hang upon wall inscription legible seem way 
would much singular hang inscription could read 
doubt replied thorndyke 
agree would still singular man hang upon wall inscription could read hang upside 
stared thorndyke amazement 
mean tell exclaimed photograph really upside indeed replied 
know yet another oriental scholar thorndyke chuckled 
fool replied said little knowledge dangerous thing 
compared much knowledge may vast deal better knowledge 
case point 
read keen interest wonderful history decipherment cuneiform writing happen recollect one two main facts seemed worth remembering 
particular inscription persian cuneiform much simple open form script babylonian assyrian fact suspect famous inscription gateway persepolis first deciphered would account presence frame 
script consists see two kinds characters small solid acutely pointed characters known wedges larger obtuse characters somewhat like government broad arrows called arrow heads 
names rather unfortunate forms wedge like resemble arrow heads 
script reads left right like writing unlike semitic peoples primitive greeks rule placing characters wedges point right downwards arrow head forms open towards right 
look photograph see wedges point upwards left arrow head characters open towards left 
obviously photograph upside 
exclaimed really mysterious 
suppose explanation think replied thorndyke may perhaps get suggestion back frame 
let us see 
disengaged frame two nails hung turning round glanced back presented inspection 
label backing paper bore words j budge frame maker gilder gt 
anne street wc well said read label without gathering anything fresh 
label observe right way hangs wall 
rejoined hastily little annoyed quicker observe obvious fact 
see point 
mean frame maker hung thing upside jeffrey never noticed mistake perfectly sound explanation said thorndyke 
think something 
notice label old one must years judge dingy appearance whereas two mirror plates look comparatively new 
soon put matter test label evidently stuck frame new plates screwed time wood cover clean new looking 
drew pocket combination knife containing among implements screw driver carefully extracted screws one little brass plates frame suspended nails 
see said removed plate carried photograph gasjet wood covered plate dirty time stained rest frame 
plates put recently 
infer well since marks plates rings upon frame may safely infer photograph never hung came rooms 
yes suppose may 
inference lead thorndyke reflected moments continued evident photograph suggests 
like hear exposition bearing case 
whether real bearing case thorndyke answered impossible say stage 
told proposed one two hypotheses account explain jeffrey blackmore may say curious misplacement photograph fits one 
say think would profitable work case independently 
facts shall copy notes marchmont statement case 
material ought able reach conclusion 
course neither us may able make anything case look hopeful present whatever happens compare notes event richer much experience actual investigation 
start one hint neither marchmont seem appreciate least extraordinary nature facts communicated us 
thought marchmont seemed pretty much alive fact queer 
agreed thorndyke 
quite mean 
whole set circumstances taken together relation one another impressed remarkable giving much attention looks first sight like unpromising case 
copy notes jervis examine facts critically 
think see mean 
let us proceed 
replaced brass plate reinserted screws hung frame proceeded browse slowly round room stopping inspect japanese color prints framed photographs buildings objects archaeological interest formed attempts wall decoration 
one former drew attention 
things value remarked 
one utamaro little circle mark signature notice paper becoming spotted places mildew 
fact worth noting one connection 
accordingly made mental note perambulation continued 
observe jeffrey used gas stove instead coal fire doubt economize work perhaps reasons 
presumably cooked gas let us see 
wandered little cupboard like kitchen glanced round 
ring burner shelf kettle frying pan pieces crockery sole appointments 
apparently porter correct statement jeffrey habits 
returning sitting room thorndyke resumed inspection pulling table drawers peering inquisitively cupboards bestowing passing glance comparatively objects comfortless room contained 
never seen characterless apartment final comment 
nothing seems suggest kind habitual activity part occupant 
let us look bedroom 
passed chamber tragic memories thorndyke lit gas stood awhile looking us silence 
bare comfortless room dirty neglected squalid 
bed appeared remade since catastrophe indentation still marked place corpse lain even slight powdering ash could still seen shabby counterpane 
looked typical opium smoker bedroom 
well thorndyke remarked length character enough kind 
jeffrey blackmore would seem man needs 
one could hardly imagine bedroom less attention seemed given comfort occupant 
looked keenly continued syringe rest lethal appliances material taken away see 
probably analyst return 
opium pipe jar ash bowl presume clothes undertakers removed body 
shall look took clothes lay roughly folded chair held garment garment 
evidently trousers remarked spreading bed 
little white spot middle thigh looks like patch small crystals drop solution 
light lamp jervis let us examine lens 
lit lamp examined spot minutely identified mass minute crystals thorndyke asked make creases see one leg 
looks trousers turned 
must turned seven inches 
poor jeffrey much regard appearances would right socks 
perhaps creases made undressing body 
possible said thorndyke though quite see would happened 
notice pockets seem emptied wait something waistcoat pocket 
drew shabby pigskin card case stump lead pencil latter looked seemed much interest deserved commonplace object 
cards observe said printed type plate 
would note fact 
tell make 
handed pencil examined concentrated attention helping even lamp pocket lens 
even aids failed discover anything unusual appearance 
thorndyke watched mischievous smile finished inquired well confound exclaimed 
pencil 
fool see particular fool see 
wretched stump pencil villainously cut abominably bad point 
colored dark red outside stamped name began c co operative stores perhaps 
dear jervis thorndyke protested begin confusing speculation fact 
letters remain c note fact find pencils inscriptions beginning letters 
going help easily 
good discipline even fact turns mean nothing 
moment stepped back suddenly looking floor said give lamp jervis trodden something felt like glass 
brought lamp place standing close bed knelt floor throwing light lamp bare dusty boards 
bed within reach foot person standing close little patch fragments glass 
thorndyke produced piece paper pocket delicately swept little fragments remarking look things first person trodden object whatever 
mind holding lamp inspect remains took lamp held paper examined little heap glass lens 
well asked 
found asking replied 
far judge appearance fragments appear portions small watch glass 
wish larger pieces 
perhaps said let us look floor bed 
resumed groping dirty floor throwing light lamp one spot another 
presently moved lamp light fell small glass bead instantly picked exhibited thorndyke 
interest asked 
thorndyke took bead examined curiously 
certainly said odd thing find bedroom old bachelor like jeffrey especially know employed woman look rooms 
course may relic last tenant 
let us see 
renewed search crawling bed throwing light lamp directions floor 
result discovery three beads one entire bugle crushed remains another apparently trodden 
including fragments bugle crushed thorndyke placed carefully paper laid dressing table conveniently examine find 
sorry said fragments watch glass whatever 
broken pieces evidently picked exception one trod isolated fragment overlooked 
beads judging number position found crushed bugle instance must dropped jeffrey tenancy probably quite recently 
sort garment suppose came asked 
may part beaded veil trimming dress grouping rather suggests tag bead fringe 
color rather unusual 
thought looked like black beads 
light think daylight shall find dark reddish brown 
see color look smaller fragments one crushed 
handed lens verified statement produced pocket small tin box closely fitting lid deposited paper first folded small parcel 
put pencil said returned box pocket added better get one little boxes polton 
often useful safe receptacle small fragile articles 
folded replaced dead man clothes found 
observing pair shoes standing wall picked looked thoughtfully paying special attention backs soles fronts heels 
suppose may take said shoes poor jeffrey wore night death 
rate seem others 
seems fairly clean walker 
streets shockingly dirty day remember distinctly 
see slippers noticed 
opened peeped cupboard overcoat surmounted felt hat hung peg like attenuated suicide looked corners sitting room slippers seen 
friend seems surprisingly little regard comfort thorndyke remarked 
think spending winter evenings damp boots gas fire perhaps opium pipe compensated said may gone bed early 

night porter used see light rooms one clock morning 
sitting room remember 
seems habit reading bed perhaps smoking candlestick remains whole dynasty candles 
gas room wanted candle undress 
used stearine candles common paraffin variety 
wonder went expense 
perhaps smell paraffin candle spoiled aroma opium suggested thorndyke made reply continued inspection room pulling drawer washstand contained single worn nail brush even picking examining dry cracked cake soap dish 
seems fair amount clothing said thorndyke going chest drawers though look change often shirts rather yellow faded appearance 
wonder managed washing 
couple pairs boots drawer clothes stock candles 
quite large box though nearly empty stearine candles six pound 
closed drawer cast another inquiring look round room

certainly sir 
got done 
laundry people used deliver basket lodge mr blackmore used take happened passing 
delivered chambers sir 
mr blackmore studious gentleman like disturbed 
studious gentleman would naturally like disturbed 
thorndyke cordially agreed proper sentiments finally wished porter good night 
passed gateway wych street turning faces eastward towards temple set forth silence thinking thoughts 
thorndyke tell though doubt busily engaged piecing together seen heard considering possible application case hand 
mind whirl confusion 
searching examining seemed mere flogging dead horse

proceeded lane address given entering office thorndyke made request somewhat surprise clerk thorndyke quite kind person one naturally associates stabling workshops 
however difficulty clerk sorted keys bunch hanging hook remarked expect find place rather dirty neglected condition 
house cleaned yet left brokers took away furniture 
last tenant sold thorndyke asked 
oh 
leave rather unexpectedly take business germany 
hope paid rent said thorndyke 
oh yes 
trust us 
say mr weiss name man means 
seemed plenty money though always paid notes 
fancy banking account country 
six seven months imagine know many people england paid us cash deposit lieu references first came 
think said name weiss 
h weiss chance believe

mr weiss gone back hamburg clerk observed 
ah said thorndyke would seem

dear said thorndyke small world 
happen note address hamburg clerk replied 
see done got rent though house actually surrendered yet 
mr weiss housekeeper still front door key

took keys wooden label attached made way back towards house mystery discussing clerk statements went 
communicable young gentleman thorndyke remarked

look see another top door lock middle must highly effective

diabolical affair jervis thorndyke said length ominously quiet even gentle tone 
sordid callous cold blooded crime type utterly unforgivable incapable extenuation 
course may failed 
mr graves may even alive

looked thorndyke something akin awe 
quiet unemotional tone voice unruffled manner stony calm face something much impressive fateful could fiercest threats passionate denunciations 
felt softly spoken words pronounced doom fugitive villain 
turned away window glanced round empty room

yes replied thorndyke much information gathered afraid 
see swept small litter floor poked grate

thorndyke went systematically examining item attentively even local tradesmen bills empty paper bags laying aside 
another rake stick scattered bulky masses crumpled paper brought view object picked eagerness 
portion pair spectacles apparently trodden side bar twisted bent glass shattered fragments

let us see find remainder 
groped carefully sticks amongst rubbish spreading hearth removing numerous pieces crumpled paper 
search rewarded discovery second eye picce spectacles glass badly cracked less shattered 
also picked two tiny sticks thorndyke looked deep interest laying mantelshelf 
consider presently said 
let us finish spectacles first 
see left eye glass concave cylindrical lens sort 
make much fragments remain measure curvature get home although easier collect fragments stick together 
right eye plain glass quite evident

spectacles without doubt 
peculiar frames continued 
made country might able discover maker 
must collect many fragments glass 
searched amongst rubbish succeeded eventually recovering seven eight small fragments broken spectacle glasses thorndyke laid mantelshelf beside little sticks

wandered disconsolately round room peering empty cupboards scanning floor corners skirting without discovering single object relic late occupants

rat exclaimed thorndyke 
would smell whole pack foxes mr h weiss would guard ever 
let us look rooms nothing

go ravensden street kennington park road pick omnibus take mansion house change kensington

yes said thorndyke seems good plan 
walk see get fair start 
walked briskly along lane ravensden street kennington park road 
omnibus approaching south steady jog trot halted corner wait 
several people passed us different directions none seemed take particular notice us though observed rather narrowly especially women 
omnibus crawled

presently colleague waved hand turned back towards vauxhall satisfied pursuing cab hurrying foot passenger sight decided precautions unnecessary settled rather comfortable position 
chapter x hunter hunted omnibus days leisurely vehicle 
ordinary pace rather sluggish trot thickly populated thoroughfare speed reduced frequent stoppages 
bearing facts mind gave occasional backward glance jogged northward though attention soon began wander rather remote possibility pursuit incidents late exploration 
difficult see thorndyke well pleased results search excepting letter undoubtedly opened channel inquiry possible identification could perceive traces found justified satisfaction 
spectacles instance 
almost certainly pair worn mr graves 
exceedingly improbable able discover maker still improbable would able give us information would help us 
spectacle makers usually confidential terms customers 
objects could make nothing 
little sticks reed evidently use known thorndyke furnished inference kind information weiss graves mrs schallibaum 
never seen anything like conveyed nothing whatever 
bottle seemed significant thorndyke quite uninforming

good lady stuck like burr least believe

perfectly asinine mistake jervis 
started kennington park road leisurely jog trotting omnibus neither remembered underneath kennington park road

idiot mean electric railway yes 
explains everything 
mrs schallibaum must watched us shop quietly followed us lane 
good many women several walking direction 
nothing distinguish others unless recognized would hardly able worn veil kept fair distance 
least think 
agreed certainly 
seen half dark room 
outdoor clothes veil never able identify without close inspection 
besides disguise make 
time

would get borough station might take risky chance go monument case would wait omnibus hail get inside 
suppose took passengers way oh dear yes 
stopping every two three minutes take set passengers women 
well may take arrived mansion house mrs schallibaum one inside passengers 
rather quaint situation think 
yes confound couple noodles must thought us doubt 
one consoling feature case 
taken us pair absolute greenhorns

chanced railway came chanced remaining theater came 
calculated probability getting tea came hit 
took one chance many assumed probably took sugar tea wrong 
taking granted sugar prepared remarked 
yes 
explanation entirely hypothetical may entirely wrong 
hangs together find poisonous matter sugar reasonable assume right 
sugar experimentum crucis 
hand go laboratory make preliminary test two 
took lump sugar pocket gave carried gas burner light examined lens 
see foreign crystals surface said better make solution go work systematically

man weiss type would almost certainly use alkaloid account smaller bulk ready solubility

legal purposes would seriously interfere value evidence 
bodies suspected containing poison carefully isolated preserved contact anything might lead doubt analysis

add acid said introduce fresh matter adopt simple preliminary measure tasting solution 
sugar disturbing factor alkaloids mineral poisons excepting arsenic characteristic taste 
dipped glass rod warm solution applied gingerly tongue

much doubt sugar 
let recommend learned brother try flavor 
careful 
little go long way 
took fresh rod rack dipping solution handed 
cautiously applied tip tongue immediately aware peculiar tingling sensation accompanied feeling numbness 
well said thorndyke aconite replied without hesitation 
yes agreed aconite probably aconitine 
think gives us information want 
need trouble make complete analysis though shall quantitative examination made later 
note intensity taste see strength solution 
evidently lump sugar contained large dose poison 
sugar dissolved tea quantity drank would contained enough aconitine lay within minutes would account mrs schallibaum anxiety get clear premises 
saw drink cup imagine seen turn sugar 
say judge expression 
looked terrified 
hardened rascally companion 
fortunate jervis 
fluster would waited poured tea probably meant dropped sugar milk jug 
either case would got poisonous dose noticed anything amiss 
pretty pair thorndyke exclaimed 
human life seems life fly beetle 

typical poisoners worst kind intelligent cautious resourceful kind 
standing menace society 
long large human lives danger business see remain large moment longer unavoidable 
brings us another point 
better keep indoors next days 
oh nonsense protested 
take care 
dispute said thorndyke although might 
matter vital importance careful 
evidence could convict people 
know stick nothing get rid time almost certainly ascertained tea shop plan failed 
life value another person could mention apart indispensable instrument ridding society dangerous vermin 
moreover seen abroad connected chambers would get information case really investigated businesslike manner 
weiss already left country would immediately mrs schallibaum would join might never able lay hands 
must stay indoors sight better write miss gibson ask warn servants give information anyone 
long asked held parole long think 
promising start 
luck shall able collect evidence want week 
element chance prevents giving date 
possible may started false track 
shall able tell better day two 
suppose said gloomily shall hunt altogether replied 
got blackmore case attend 
shall hand documents get make orderly digest evidence 
facts work case 
also shall ask help polton little operations designed throw light dark places find entertaining instructive 
supposing mrs hornby propose call take tea us gardens suggested 
bring miss gibson thorndyke added dryly 
jervis would never 
must make quite clear 
probable mrs schallibaum made careful note house endsley gardens would one place actually known weiss england would almost certainly keep watch 
succeed connecting house chambers inquiries would show exact state case 
must keep dark possibly 
shown much hand already 
hard helped 
oh think complaining exclaimed 
matter business keen 
thought first merely considering safety vile body 
shall start job morrow morning 
shall give notes blackmore case copies depositions better draw digest evidence remarks conclusions suggests 
gleanings new inn looked considered regard case fragments pair spectacles better put together rather intelligible form case produce evidence 
keep occupied day two together work appertaining cases 
let us dismiss professional topics 
dined neither dare say polton made arrangements sort meal 
go see 
descended lower floor thorndyke anticipations justified neatly laid table polton giving finishing touches 
chapter xi blackmore case reviewed one conditions medical practice capability transferring one attention moment notice one set circumstances another equally important entirely unrelated 
visit round practitioner finds concerned particular self contained group phenomena must consider moment utmost concentration must instantly dismiss mind moves next case 
difficult habit acquire important distressing obscure case apt take possession consciousness hinder exercise attention succeeding cases demand experience shows faculty indispensable practitioner learns time forget everything patient whose condition occupied moment 
first morning work blackmore case showed faculty demanded legal practice also showed yet acquire 
looked depositions copy memories mysterious house kennington lane continually intruded reflections figure mrs schallibaum white faced terrified expectant haunted continually 
truth interest blackmore case little academic whereas kennington case one parties personally concerned 
john blackmore name jeffrey shadowy figure could assign definite personality stephen casual stranger 
mr graves hand real person 
seen amidst tragic circumstances probably heralded death brought away lively recollection feeling profound pity concern fate 
villain weiss terrible woman aided abetted perhaps even directed lived memory vivid dreadful realities 
although uttered hint thorndyke lamented inwardly given work connected case deeply interested rather dry purely legal utterly bewildering case jeffrey blackmore 
nevertheless stuck loyally task 
read depositions without getting single glimmer fresh light case made careful digest facts 
compared digest thorndyke notes also made copy found brief contained several matters overlooked 
also drew brief account visit new inn list objects observed collected 
addressed second part task statement conclusions facts set forth 
came make attempt realized completely sea 
spite thorndyke recommendation study marchmont statement summarized notes copied hint find statement something highly significant borne irresistibly one conclusion one wrong one suspected jeffrey blackmore perfectly regular sound valid document 
tried attack validity various directions failed every time 
genuineness obviously question 
seemed two conceivable respects objection could raised viz 
competency jeffrey execute possibility undue influence brought bear 
reference first undoubted fact jeffrey addicted opium habit might circumstances interfere testator competency make 
circumstances existed case drug habit produced mental changes deceased would destroy weaken judgment particle evidence favor belief 
end managed affairs habits life undergone change still habits perfectly sane responsible man 
question undue influence difficult 
applied person particular person could none john blackmore 
undoubted fact jeffrey acquaintance brother john one knew residence new inn 
moreover john visited 
therefore possible influence might brought bear deceased 
evidence 
fact deceased man brother one person knew living remarkable one satisfactorily explained necessity jeffrey finding reference applying chambers 
theory undue influence fact testator voluntarily brought lodge executed presence entirely disinterested witnesses 
end give problem despair abandoning documents turned attention facts elicited visit new inn 
learned exploration clear thorndyke picked facts appeared important 
important respect possible issue could raised validity otherwise jeffrey blackmore since validity supported positive evidence incontestable kind seemed nothing observed could real bearing case 
course could 
thorndyke dreamer addicted wild speculation 
facts observed us seemed relevant case prepared assume relevant although could see connection 
assumption proceeded examine afresh 
whatever thorndyke might observed account brought away dead man chambers single fact extraordinary fact 
cuneiform inscription upside 
sum evidence collected question prove thorndyke conveyed deep significance 
could significance inverted position mere temporary accident might frame stood shelf support 
hung wall plates screwed frame showed position permanent never hung 
could hung jeffrey clearly inconceivable 
allowing fixed present position workman new tenant moved fact remained hung presumably months jeffrey blackmore expert knowledge cuneiform character never noticed upside noticed never taken trouble altered 
could mean noticed error troubled correct would point singular state mind inertness indifference remarkable even opium smoker 
assuming state mind could see bearing excepting rather inconsistent tendency make fussy needless alterations testator actually shown 
hand noticed inverted position photograph must nearly blind quite idiotic photograph two feet long characters large enough read easily person ordinary eyesight distance forty fifty feet 
obviously state dementia whereas eyesight admittedly bad seemed conclusion deducible photograph furnished measure badness deceased man vision proved verging total blindness 
nothing startling new 
declared fast losing sight 
bearing partial blindness totally blind man draw 
eyesight sufficient enable write sign mere defective vision lead muddle provisions 
yet something kind seemed thorndyke mind recalled question put porter read mr blackmore presence read aloud question could one significance 
implied doubt whether testator fully aware exact nature document signing 
yet able write sign surely able also read say nothing fact unless demented must remembered written 
thus reasoning led blind alley end regular valid fulfilling requirements law imposed 
confess beaten full agreement mr marchmont case nothing dispute 
nevertheless carefully fixed pocket file thorndyke given copy made notes together notes visit new inn unsatisfactory conclusions arrived brought end first morning new capacity 
thorndyke asked sat lunch learned friend progressed propose advise mr marchmont enter caveat read documents boiled evidence stiff jelly worse fog ever

never mind fog jervis 
certain virtue fog 
serves like picture frame surround essential neutral zone separates irrelevant 
profound observation thorndyke remarked ironically 
thinking rejoined 
could contrive explain means oh unreasonable 
one throws subtly philosophic obiter dictum one looks discerning critic supply meaning 
way going introduce gentle art photography afternoon 
getting loan cheques drawn jeffrey blackmore residence new inn twenty three told going photograph 
thought bank people would let go possession 
going 
one partners mr britton bringing present photographs taken go custody 
great concession obtained fact done good deal work bank mr britton less personal friend 
way comes cheques bank returned jeffrey pass book usual way understand britton replied thorndyke jeffrey cheques retained bank request 
traveling used leave investment securities valuable documents bankers custody never applied returned bankers still retaining proved course hand everything executors 
object photographing cheques asked 
several objects 
first since good photograph practically good original photographs practically cheques reference 
since photograph duplicated indefinitely possible perform experiments involve destruction would course impossible case original cheques 
ultimate object mean 
going prove incorrigible jervis exclaimed 
know going prove investigation 
knew result beforehand want perform experiment 
looked watch rose table said finished better go laboratory see apparatus ready 
mr britton busy man us great service keep waiting comes 
ascended laboratory polton already busy inspecting massively built copying camera long steel guides easel copy holder traveled took whole length room side opposite occupied chemical bench 
inducted photographic art looked attention ever done 
made improvements since last sir said polton delicately lubricating steel guides 
fitted steel runners instead blackleaded wooden ones used 
made two scales instead one 
hallo downstairs bell 
shall go sir perhaps better said thorndyke 
may mr britton want caught delayed 
however mr britton breezy alert looking middle aged man came escorted polton shook hands cordially previously warned presence 
carried small solid hand bag clung tenaciously moment contents required use 
camera said running inquisitive eye instrument 
fine one bit photographer 
graduation side bar scales replied thorndyke shows degree magnification reduction 
pointer fixed easel travels course showing exact size photograph 
pointer opposite photograph identical size object photographed points say x photograph six times long object magnified thirty six times superficially whereas pointer photograph sixth length object one thirty sixth superficial 
two scales mr britton asked 
separate scale two lenses principally use 
great magnification reduction lens comparatively short focus must used long focus lens gives perfect image use one long focus thirty six inches copying size slight magnification reduction 
going magnify cheques mr britton asked 
first place replied thorndyke 
convenience speed going photograph half size six cheques go one whole plate 
afterwards enlarge negatives much like 
probably enlarge signatures case 
precious bag opened twenty three cheques brought laid bench consecutive series order dates 
fixed tapes avoid making pin holes batches six small drawing boards batch arranged signatures towards middle 
first board clamped easel latter slid along guides pointer stood long focus scale thorndyke proceeded focus camera aid little microscope polton made purpose 
mr britton inspected exquisitely sharp image focusing screen microscope polton introduced plate made first exposure carrying dark slide develop plate next batch cheques fixed position 
photographic technique everything else polton followed closely could methods principal instructor methods characterized unhurried precision leads perfect accomplishment 
first negative brought forth dripping dark room without spot stain scratch pin hole uniform color exactly required density 
six cheques shown ridiculously small appearance though reduced half length looked clear sharp fine etchings though sure opportunity examining rather limited polton uncommonly careful keep wet plate reach safe injury 
well said mr britton end seance returned treasures bag got twenty three cheques intents purposes 
hope going make unlawful use must tell cashiers keep bright look lowered voice impressively addressed polton understand private matter dr thorndyke 
course mr blackmore dead reason cheques photographed legal purposes want talked think dr thorndyke 
certainly thorndyke agreed emphatically need uneasy mr britton 
uncommunicative people establishment 
colleague escorted visitor stairs returned subject cheques 
understand want remarked 
question turning signatures case blackmore deceased say thorndyke replied rather evasively 
say decidedly said mr britton understood marchmont aright 
even let tell signatures got help 
looked closely seen signatures time know 
marchmont asked glance matter form believe matters form examined carefully 
appreciable amount variation appreciable amount 
variation one trace personal character matters subtle indescribable quality makes recognizable expert eye jeffrey blackmore writing 
understand 
quality remains coarser characteristics vary man may grow old fat bald may take drink become quite changed yet preserves certain something makes recognizable member particular family 
well find quality signatures enough experience handwriting 
thought best mention case might giving unnecessary trouble 
good said thorndyke need say information great value coming highly expert source 
matter fact hint great value 
shook hands mr britton latter disappeared stairs turned sitting room remarked weighty significant observation jervis 
advise consider attentively bearings 
mean fact signatures undoubtedly genuine meant rather interesting general truth contained britton statement physiognomy mere matter facial character 
man carries personal trademark face nervous system muscles giving rise characteristic movements gait larynx producing individual voice even mouth shown individual peculiarities speech accent 
individual nervous system means characteristic movements transfers peculiarities inanimate objects products movements see pictures carving musical execution handwriting 
one ever painted quite like reynolds romney one ever played exactly like liszt paganini pictures sounds produced speak extension physiognomy artist 
handwriting 
particular specimen product particular set motor centres individual brain 
interesting considerations thorndyke remarked quite see present application 
mean bear special way blackmore case think bear directly 
thought mr britton making illuminating remarks 
see 
fact see going question signatures 
signature admittedly genuine seems dispose whole affair 
dear jervis said marchmont allowing obsessed particular fact striking weighty fact admit still isolated fact 
jeffrey blackmore executed regular manner complying necessary formalities conditions 
face single circumstance marchmont would chuck sponge old pugilists expressed 
great mistake 
never allow bullied browbeaten single fact 
dear thorndyke protested fact seems final 
covers possibilities unless suggest would cancel 
could suggest dozen replied 
let us take instance 
supposing jeffrey executed wager immediately revoked made fresh placed latter custody person person suppressed 
surely make suggestion seriously exclaimed 
certainly replied smile 
merely give instance show final absolute fact really conditional fact cancels 
think might made third obviously possible 
man makes two wills may make three may say see present reason assuming existence another 
want impress necessity considering facts instead bumping heavily conspicuous one forgetting rest 
way little problem 
object parts pushed across table little cardboard box first removed lid 
number small pieces broken glass cemented together edges 
suppose said looking considerable curiosity little collection pieces glass picked poor blackmore bedroom yes 
see polton endeavoring reconstitute object whatever successful fragments small irregular collection incomplete 
however specimen built six small pieces exhibits general character object fairly well 
picked little irregularly shaped object handed could admire neatness polton joined tiny fragments together 
took little restoration holding eyes moved fro looked window 
lens pronounced eventually 
thorndyke agreed lens 
spectacle glass 
surface curved one side convex concave little piece remains original edge seems ground fit bezel frame 
say portions watch glass 
polton opinion said thorndyke think wrong 
say glass miniature locket rather probable view 
think asked 
thorndyke drawn 
submitting problem solution learned friend replied exasperating smile added say polton wrong agree 
perhaps better make note properties object consider leisure ruminating data referring blackmore case 
ruminations said always lead back point 
let replied 
shuffle data 
invent hypotheses 
never mind seem rather wild 
put aside account 
take first hypothesis invent test thoroughly facts

time fail establish given case exclude particular explanation facts narrow field inquiry 
repeating process bound end arrive imaginary case fits facts 
imaginary case real case problem solved 
let recommend give method trial 
promised though lively expectations result subject allowed present drop 
chapter xii portrait state mind thorndyke advised cultivate one come easily 
however much endeavored shuffle facts blackmore case one inevitably turned top pack 
circumstances surrounding execution jeffrey blackmore intruded cogitations subject hopeless persistency 
scene porter lodge king charles head poor mr dick 
midst praiseworthy efforts construct intelligible scheme case would make appearance reduce mind instant chaos 
next days thorndyke much occupied one two civil cases kept court whole sitting came home seemed indisposed talk professional topics 
meanwhile polton worked steadily photographs signatures view gaining experience assisted watched methods 
present case signatures enlarged original dimensions rather less inch half length length four half inches rendered little peculiarities handwriting surprisingly distinct conspicuous 
signature eventually mounted slip card bearing number date cheque taken possible place two signatures together comparison 
looked whole series carefully compared showed differences without discovering anything might expected view mr britton statement 
trifling variations much alike one could doubt looking written hand 
however apparently dispute furnished new information 
thorndyke object felt certain something definite mind must test something apart genuineness signatures 
could something dared ask questions kind anathema nothing lie low see would photographs 
whole series finished fourth morning adventure sloane square pack cards duly delivered polton brought breakfast tray 
thorndyke took pack somewhat air whist player ran noticed number increased twenty three twenty four 
additional one thorndyke explained signature first marchmont possession 
added collection carries us back earlier date 
signature second presumably resembles cheques drawn date 
material become could claim examine second 
laid cards table order dates slowly ran eye series 
watched closely ventured presently ask agree mr britton general identity character whole set signatures yes replied 
certainly put signatures one person 
variations slight 
later signatures little stiffer little shaky indistinct b k appreciably different earlier ones 
another fact emerges whole series seen together striking significant fact astonished remarked mr britton 
indeed said stooping examine photographs fresh interest simple fact obvious yet said significant 
look carefully number one signature first dated three years ago compare number three dated eighteenth september last year 
look identical said careful comparison 
said thorndyke 
neither shows change occurred later 
look number two dated sixteenth september see later style 
number four dated twenty third september numbers five six beginning october earlier style like signature 
thereafter signatures new style compare number two dated sixteenth september number twenty four dated fourteenth march year day jeffrey death see exhibit difference 
later style last shows greater change first 
consider facts striking significant reflected moments trying make deep significance thorndyke directing attention succeeding triumphantly 
mean said occasional reversions earlier form convey material suggestion yes 
learn inspection series change character signature slight change quite recognizable 
change gradual insidious progressive 
occurred certain definite time 
first one two reversions earlier form number six new style continued end notice continued without increase change without variation 
intermediate forms 
signatures old style new none half half 
repeat two types signature much alike distinguishable 
alternate merge one another produce intermediate forms 
change occurs abruptly shows tendency increase time goes progressive change 
make jervis remarkable said poring cards verify thorndyke statements 
quite know make 
circumstances admitted idea forgery one would suspect genuineness signatures 
rate case later say nothing mr britton opinion signatures 
still said thorndyke must explanation change character signatures explanation failing eyesight writer gradually progressive continuous condition whereas change writing abrupt intermittent 
considered thorndyke remark moments light though brilliant one seemed break 
think see driving said mean change writing must associated new condition affecting writer condition existed intermittently thorndyke nodded approvingly continued intermittent condition know effect opium 
might consider clearer signatures made jeffrey normal state less distinct ones bout opium smoking 
perfectly sound reasoning said thorndyke 
conclusion lead suggests opium habit recently acquired since change noticed time went live new inn since change writing first intermittent continuous may infer opium smoking first occasional later became confirmed habit 
quite reasonable conclusion clearly stated said thorndyke 
say entirely agree exhausted information signatures offer 
started right direction 
may right road said gloomily stuck fast one place see chance getting farther 
quantity data said thorndyke 
facts start constructed hypothesis busily engaged verifying 
data money makes money knowledge begets knowledge put original capital interest 
shall tabulate facts joint possession see suggest grasped eagerly offer though conned notes 
thorndyke produced slip paper drawer uncapping fountain pen proceeded write leading facts reading aloud soon written

evident intention testator leave bulk property stephen blackmore

struggle would general conclusion could made emerge mass apparently disconnected facts 
well thorndyke said presently watching grave interest unavailing efforts make nothing exclaimed desperately slapping paper table 
course see queer coincidences

object believe certainly

say offering group vague coincidences would muddle brain 
thorndyke chuckled softly pursued subject farther 
put paper file notes said think leisure

suddenly identity man flashed mind exclaimed astonishment poor creature kennington mr graves think replied thorndyke think 
could swear identity court law firm conviction photograph mr graves 
would swear 
man ought swear said thorndyke 
identification always matter opinion belief 
man swear unconditionally identity memory man whose evidence discredited 
think sworn testimony would sufficient 
needless say production photograph filled amazement curiosity thorndyke obtained 
replaced impassively envelope without volunteering explanation felt could question directly 
nevertheless ventured approach subject indirect manner

woman new factor case know place 
entirely new said thorndyke 
forgotten beads found jeffrey bedroom forgotten see told us much excepting woman apparently bedroom time 
think tell us 
tell us particular woman bedroom particular time good deal significant 
yes 
almost looks must made away 
much 
way right colors beads also way used 
use mere guess turned correct 
well found beads small amount information give still enough carry us stage 
mean cabman evidence tells us woman entered house 
beads tell us bedroom say seems connect extent jeffrey death 
necessarily course 
suggestion rather strong suggestion peculiar circumstances 
even said new fact seems far clearing mystery add fresh element still deeper mystery 
porter evidence inquest could leave doubt jeffrey contemplated suicide preparations pointedly suggest particular night time selected away 
certainly 
porter evidence clear point 
see woman comes 
obvious presence inn especially bedroom occasion strange secret circumstances rather sinister look yet see way could connected tragedy 
perhaps nothing 
remember jeffrey went lodge eight clock pay rent chatted time porter 
looks lady already left 
yes said thorndyke 
hand jeffrey remarks porter reference cab quite agree account heard wilkins 
suggests wilkins account generally secrecy lady visit chambers 
know woman asked

rather strong suspicion identify waiting facts 
suspicion founded new matter discovered deducible facts known think replied know practically know although one instance turned strong suspicion certainty inquiries 
think ought able form idea lady probably 
woman mentioned case 
think able give lady name notwithstanding 
begin suspect cut medico legal practice see faintest glimmer suggestion 
thorndyke smiled benevolently 
discouraged jervis said 
expect first began go round wards doubted whether cut medical practice 

special work one needs special knowledge acquired faculty making use 
second year student make small thoracic aneurysm knows anatomy chest begins know normal heart sounds areas dullness yet fit various items knowledge together

facts student acquired faculty instantly connecting abnormality function correleated anatomical change 
matter experience 
previous training soon acquire faculty 
try observe everything 
let nothing escape 
try constantly find connection facts events seem unconnected 
advice put away blackmore case present consider day work end 
chapter xiv thorndyke lays mine information supplied mr samuel wilkins far dispelling cloud mystery hung blackmore case enveloped deeper obscurity far concerned 
new problem thorndyke offered solution tougher one others 
proposed identify give name mysterious woman 
could woman excepting mrs wilson mentioned connection case 
new dramatis persona appeared suddenly nowhere straightway vanished without leaving trace excepting two three beads picked jeffrey room 
least clear part played tragedy 
facts still pointed plainly suicide appearance 
jeffrey repeated hints intentions significant preparations made enough negative idea foul play 
yet woman presence chambers time secret manner arrival precautions recognition strongly suggested kind complicity dreadful event followed 
complicity possible case suicide woman might furnished syringe poison would necessary go chambers purpose 
vague ideas persuasion hypnotic suggestion floated brain explanations fit case hypnotic suggestion crime convincing medical mind 
thought blackmail connection disgraceful secret though hopeful suggestion probable considering jeffrey age character 
speculations failed throw faintest light main question woman couple days passed thorndyke made reference case 
time away home though engaged idea 
rather unusual polton seemed deserted laboratory taken outdoor pursuits 
assumed seized opportunity leaving charge dimly surmised acting thorndyke private inquiry agent seemed done case samuel wilkins 
evening second day thorndyke came home obviously good spirits first proceedings aroused expectant curiosity 
went cupboard brought forth box trichinopoly cheroots 
trichinopoly cheroot thorndyke one dissipation enjoyed rare specially festive occasions practice meant occasions scored important point solved unusually tough problem 
wherefore watched lively interest 
pity trichy poisonous beast remarked taking one cheroots sniffing delicately 
cigar like really abandoned smoker 
laid cigar back box continued think shall treat one dinner celebrate occasion 
occasion asked 
completion blackmore case 
going write marchmont advising enter caveat 
mean say discovered flaw flaw exclaimed 
dear jervis second forgery 
stared amazement assertion sounded like nothing less arrant nonsense 
thing impossible thorndyke said 
witnesses recognize signatures painter greasy finger marks read remembered contents 
yes interesting feature case 
pretty problem 
shall give last chance solve 
morrow evening shall give full explanation another twenty four hours think 
meanwhile going take club dine 
think shall pretty safe mrs schallibaum 
sat wrote letter apparently quite short one addressed stamped prepared go 
come said let us away gay festive scenes halls dazzling light 
lay mine fleet street pillar box 
like marchmont office explodes 
expect matter said explosion felt pretty distinctly chambers 
expect replied thorndyke reminds shall day morrow marchmont calls must persuade come round dinner bring stephen blackmore possible 
anxious stephen able give us information confirm certain matters fact 
promised exercise utmost powers persuasion mr marchmont certainly done account tiptoe curiosity hear thorndyke explanation unthinkable conclusion arrived subject dropped completely could rest evening induce colleague reopen even indirect allusive manner 
explanations respect mr marchmont fully realized following morning within hour thorndyke departure chambers knocker plied usual emphasis opening door discovered solicitor company somewhat older gentleman 
mr marchmont appeared somewhat humor companion obviously state extreme irritation 
dr jervis said marchmont entered invitation 
friend suppose returning evening 
hm sorry 
wished see rather particularly 
partner mr winwood 
latter gentleman bowed stiffly marchmont continued letter dr thorndyke may say rather curious letter fact singular letter indeed 
letter madman growled mr winwood 
winwood nothing kind 
control beg 
really letter rather incomprehensible 
relates late jeffrey blackmore know main facts case reconcile facts 
letter exclaimed mr winwood dragging document wallet slapping table 
acquainted case sir read let us hear think 
took letter read aloud jeffrey blackmore decd 
dear mr marchmont gone case great care doubt second forgery 
criminal proceedings think inevitable meanwhile would wise enter caveat 
could look chambers morrow evening could talk case glad could bring mr stephen blackmore whose personal knowledge events parties concerned would great assistance clearing obscure details 
sincerely john evelyn thorndyke cf marchmont esq 
well exclaimed mr winwood glaring ferociously think learned counsel opinion knew thorndyke writing effect replied must frankly confess make nothing 
acted advice certainly shouted irascible lawyer 
suppose wish make laughing stock courts thing impossible ridiculously impossible know said little stiffly somewhat nettled mr winwood manner thorndyke would written letter 
conclusion looks impossible complete confidence thorndyke 
says forgery doubt forgery 
deuce roared winwood 
know circumstances executed 
yes thorndyke 
man overlooks important facts 
useless argue 
complete fog case 
better come evening talk suggests 
inconvenient grumbled mr winwood 
shall dine town 
yes said marchmont thing done 
dr jervis says must take thorndyke something solid base opinion 
make elementary mistakes 
course says correct mr stephen position totally changed 
bah exclaimed winwood found mare nest tell 
still agree explanation worth hearing 
mind winwood said marchmont apologetic undertone peppery old fellow rough tongue mean harm 
statement winwood assented dissented impossible say prolonged growl 
shall expect said eight night try bring mr stephen yes replied marchmont think promise shall come us 
sent telegram asking attend 
two lawyers took departure leaving meditate upon colleague astonishing statement considerably prejudice employment 
thorndyke would able justify opinion given doubt whatever yet denying proposition mr dick swiveller would call staggerer 
thorndyke returned informed visit two friends acquainted sentiments expressed whereat smiled quiet amusement 
thought remarked letter would bring marchmont door long 
winwood never met gather one people mind 
general way object people tacitly claim exemption ordinary rules conduct held binding fellows 
promises give us variety artists call extra turn make best give run money 
thorndyke smiled mischievously understood meaning smile later evening asked think affair given answered 
paralysed brain blackmore case like endless algebraical problem propounded insane mathematician 
thorndyke laughed comparison flatter rather apt one 
come dine said let us crack bottle hearts may turn water frown disdainful winwood 
think old bell holborn meet present requirements better club 
something jovial roystering ancient tavern must keep sharp lookout mrs schallibaum 
thereupon set forth week close imprisonment looked upon friendly london streets cheerfully lighted shop windows multitudes companionable strangers moved unceasingly along pavements 
chapter xv thorndyke explodes mine back chambers minutes little brass knocker inner door rattled summons 
thorndyke opened door finding three expected visitors threshold admitted closed oak 
accepted invitation see said marchmont whose manner little flurried uneasy 
partner mr winwood met think 
well thought like hear particulars could quite understand letter 
conclusion suppose said thorndyke little unexpected sir exclaimed winwood 
absolutely irreconcilable either facts case common physical possibilities 
first glance thorndyke agreed would probably appearance 
appearance still 
said winwood growing suddenly red wrathful may say speak solicitor practising law infant arms 
tell us sir forgery executed broad daylight presence two unimpeachable witnesses sworn signatures contents document finger marks paper 
finger marks forgeries examined tested replied thorndyke 
fact interest disputing witnesses signatures 
mr winwood fairly danced irritation 
marchmont exclaimed fiercely know good gentleman believe 
tell addicted practical jokes dear winwood groaned marchmont pray beg control 
doubt confound roared winwood heard say forgery dispute signatures concluded winwood banging fist table damned nonsense 
may suggest interposed stephen blackmore came receive dr thorndyke explanation letter 
perhaps would better postpone comments heard 
undoubtedly undoubtedly said marchmont 
let entreat winwood listen patiently refrain interruption heard learned friend exposition case 
oh well winwood replied sulkily say 
sank chair manner man shuts turns key remained excepting internal pressure approached bursting point throughout subsequent proceedings silent stony impassive like seated statue obstinacy 
take said marchmont new facts possession yes replied thorndyke new facts made new use old ones 
shall lay case shall state theory sequence events furnish verification afterwards shall retrace actual course investigations give facts order obtained inferences almost think said mr marchmont would better would put us possession new facts 
conclusions follow sufficiently obvious could hear argument 
say winwood mr winwood roused instant barked one word facts shut snap 
would like new facts said thorndyke 
please 
facts first place rate 
well said thorndyke caught eye mischievous twinkle understood perfectly facts realized much two lawyers likely extract 
winwood going run money thorndyke promised 
colleague placed table side small cardboard box sheets notes file glanced quickly mr winwood began first important new facts came possession day introduced case 
evening left availed mr stephen kind invitation look uncle chambers new inn 
wished order ascertain possible habits deceased residence 
arrived dr jervis mr stephen chambers learned uncle oriental scholar position thorough acquaintance cuneiform writing 
talking mr stephen made curious discovery 
wall fire place hung large framed photograph ancient persian inscription cuneiform character photograph upside 
upside exclaimed stephen 
really odd 
odd indeed agreed thorndyke suggestive 
way came inverted pretty obvious also rather suggestive 
photograph evidently frame years apparently never hung 
said stephen though know arrived fact 
used stand mantelpiece old rooms jermyn street 
well continued thorndyke frame maker pasted label back frame label hung right way appeared person fixed photograph wall adopted guide 
extraordinary said stephen 
thought person hung would asked uncle jeffrey right way imagine earth could hung months without noticing 
must practically blind 
marchmont thinking hard knitted brows suddenly brightened 
see point said 
mean jeffrey blind would possible person substitute false might sign without noticing substitution 
make forgery growled winwood 
jeffrey signed jeffrey 
could contest could prove fraud 
said two witnesses read identified 
read aloud asked stephen 
replied thorndyke 
prove substitution asked marchmont 
asserted answered thorndyke position forgery 
said winwood 
argue said thorndyke 
ask note fact inscription upside 
also observed walls chambers valuable japanese color prints recent damp spots 
noted sitting room gas stove kitchen contained practically stores remains food hardly traces even simplest cooking 
bedroom found large box contained considerable stock hard stearine candles six pound nearly empty 
examined clothing deceased 
soles boots observed dried mud unlike jervis boots gravelly square inn 
noted crease leg deceased man trousers turned half way knee waistcoat pocket found stump contango pencil 
floor bedroom found portion oval glass somewhat like watch locket ground edge double bevel 
dr jervis also found one two beads bugle dark brown glass 
thorndyke paused marchmont gazing growing amazement said nervously er yes 
interesting 
observations er observations made new inn 
two lawyers looked one another stephen blackmore stared fixedly spot hearth rug 
mr winwood face contorted sour lopsided smile 
might observed good many things sir said looked 
examined doors would noted hinges covered paint looked chimney might noted black inside 
winwood protested marchmont agony uneasiness partner might say next must really beg er refrain mr winwood means dr thorndyke er quite perceive relevancy ah observations 
probably said thorndyke perceive relevancy later 
present ask note facts bear mind may able follow argument come 
next set data acquired evening dr jervis gave detailed account strange adventure befell 
need burden details give substance story 
proceeded recount incidents connected visits mr graves dwelling personal peculiarities parties concerned especially patient even forgetting singular spectacles worn mr weiss 
also explained briefly construction chart presenting latter inspection hearers 
recital three visitors listened utter bewilderment indeed also could conceive way adventures could possibly related affairs late mr blackmore 
manifestly view taken mr marchmont pause chart handed remarked somewhat stiffly assuming dr thorndyke curious story telling us relevance matter interested 
quite correct assumption replied thorndyke 
story relevant indeed presently convinced 
thank said marchmont sinking back chair sigh resignation 
days ago pursued thorndyke dr jervis located aid chart house called 
found late tenant left somewhat hurriedly house let kind investigation possible obtained keys made exploration premises 
gave brief account visit conditions observed proceeding furnish list articles found grate mr winwood started chair 
really sir exclaimed much come great personal inconvenience hear read inventory dust heap thorndyke smiled benevolently caught eye gleam amusement 
sit mr winwood said quietly 
came learn facts case giving 
please interrupt needlessly waste time 
winwood stared ferociously several seconds somewhat disconcerted unruffled calm manner uttered snort defiance sat heavily shut 
thorndyke continued unmoved serenity consider relics detail begin pair spectacles 
belonged person near sighted astigmatic left eye almost certainly blind right 
description agrees entirely dr jervis account sick man 
paused moment one made comment proceeded next come little pieces reed mr stephen probably recognize remains japanese brush used writing chinese ink making small drawings 
paused though expecting remark listeners one spoke continued bottle theatrical wig maker label contained cement used fixing false beards moustaches eyebrows 
paused looked round expectantly audience none however volunteered remark 
none objects described shown seem significance us asked tone surprise 
convey nothing said mr marchmont glancing partner shook head like restive horse 
mr stephen replied stephen 
existing circumstances convey reasonable suggestion 
thorndyke hesitated half inclined say something slight shrug turned notes resumed next group new facts concerned signatures recent cheques 
photographed placed together purpose comparison analysis 
prepared question signatures 
said winwood 
highly expert opinion would override court law even differed think 
yes said marchmont 
think must accept signatures especially proved beyond question authentic 
well agreed thorndyke pass signatures 
evidence regard spectacles serves verify conclusions respecting 
perhaps said marchmont might pass seem reached conclusions 
please said thorndyke 
important reserve verification 
next item interest think 
signed witnessed statement samuel wilkins driver cab deceased came home inn evening death 
colleague right 
actual document signed tangible witness could put box sworn brought lawyers state attention thorndyke read cabman evidence attention soon quickened undisguised astonishment 
mysterious affair exclaimed marchmont 
could woman could jeffrey chambers time throw light mr stephen indeed replied stephen 
complete mystery 
uncle jeffrey confirmed old bachelor although dislike women far partial society wrapped favorite studies 
best belief single female friend 
intimate terms even sister mrs wilson 
remarkable mused marchmont remarkable 
perhaps tell us dr thorndyke woman think replied thorndyke next item evidence enable form opinion 
obtained yesterday made case quite complete wrote immediately 
statement joseph ridley another cabman unfortunately rather dull unobservant fellow unlike wilkins 
much tell us little highly instructive 
statement signed deponent witnessed name joseph ridley 
driver four wheeled cab 
fourteenth march day great fog waiting vauxhall station set fare 
five clock lady came told drive upper kennington lane take passenger 
middle sized woman 
could tell age like head wrapped sort knitted woollen veil keep fog 
notice dressed 
got cab led horse upper kennington lane little way lane lady tapped front window stop 
got cab told wait 
went away disappeared fog 
presently lady gentleman came direction gone 
lady looked like lady answer 
head wrapped kind veil shawl noticed dark colored mantle bead fringe 
gentleman clean shaved wore spectacles stooped good deal 
say whether sight good bad 
helped lady cab told drive great northern station king cross 
got drove 
got station quarter six lady gentleman got 
gentleman paid fare went station 
notice anything unusual either 
directly gone got fresh fare drove away 
thorndyke concluded joseph ridley statement think enable give meaning facts offered consideration 
sure said marchmont 
exceedingly mysterious 
suggestion course woman came new inn cab mrs schallibaum replied thorndyke 
suggestion woman jeffrey blackmore 
deathly silence moments 
absolutely thunderstruck sat gaping thorndyke speechless astonishment 
mr winwood fairly bounced chair 
good sir screeched 
jeffrey blackmore time naturally replied thorndyke suggestion implies person jeffrey blackmore 
bawled winwood 
porter saw porter saw person believed jeffrey blackmore 
suggest porter belief erroneous 
well snapped winwood perhaps prove 
see going perhaps 
subsided chair glared defiantly thorndyke 
seemed said stephen suggest connection sick man graves uncle 
noted time put aside impossible 
right 
mean suggest connection suggest something connection 
suggest identity 
position sick man graves uncle 
dr jervis description said stephen man must like uncle 
blind right eye poor vision left uncle certainly used brushes kind shown us writing japanese character watched admired skill said marchmont insuperable objection time man lying sick kennington lane mr jeffrey living new inn 
evidence asked thorndyke 
evidence marchmont exclaimed impatiently 
dear sir paused suddenly leaning forward regarded thorndyke new rather startled expression 
mean suggest began 
suggest jeffrey blackmore never lived new inn 
moment marchmont seemed absolutely paralysed astonishment 
amazing proposition exclaimed length 
yet thing certainly impossible recall fact realize one known previously excepting brother john ever saw inn 
question identity never raised 
excepting said mr winwood regard body certainly jeffrey blackmore 
yes yes 
course said marchmont 
forgotten moment 
body identified beyond doubt 
dispute identity body certainly replied thorndyke 
mr winwood grasped hair hands stuck elbows knees marchmont drew forth large handkerchief mopped forehead 
stephen blackmore looked one expectantly finally said might make suggestion would dr thorndyke shown us pieces puzzle kind put together information 
yes agreed marchmont best plan 
let us argument doctor additional evidence possess 
argument said thorndyke rather long one data numerous points verification shall dwell detail 
coffee clear brains bespeak patience may seem like rather prolix demonstration 
chapter xvi exposition tragedy may wondered thorndyke commenced poured coffee handed round cups induced undertake minute investigation apparently simple straightforward case 
perhaps better explain first let see real starting point inquiry 
mr marchmont mr stephen introduced case made brief precis facts presented one two immediately attracted attention 
first place 
strange 
perfectly unnecessary 
contained new matter expressed changed intentions met new circumstances known testator 
short really new merely repetition first one drafted different less suitable language 
differed introducing certain ambiguity original free 
created possibility certain circumstances known anticipated testator john blackmore might become principal beneficiary contrary obvious wishes testator 
next point impressed manner mrs wilson death 
died cancer 
people die suddenly unexpectedly cancer 
terrible disease stands almost alone marks victim months advance 
person incurable cancer person whose death may predicted certainty date fixed within comparatively narrow limits 
observe remarkable series coincidences brought light consider peculiarity disease 
mrs wilson died twelfth march present year 
mr jeffrey second signed twelfth november last year time say existence cancer must known mrs wilson doctor might known relatives chose inquire 
observe remarkable change mr jeffrey habits coincides singular way events 
cancer must detectable early september last year time fact mrs wilson made 
mr jeffrey went inn beginning october 
time habits totally changed demonstrate change gradual abrupt change took place character signature 
short whole peculiar set curcumstances change jeffrey habits change signature execution strange came existence time mrs wilson first known suffering cancer 
struck suggestive fact 
extraordinarily opportune date mr jeffrey death 
mrs wilson died twelfth march 
mr jeffrey found dead fifteenth march apparently died fourteenth day seen alive 
died three days sooner would predeceased mrs wilson property would never devolved lived day two longer would learned death would certainly made new codicil nephew favor 
circumstances therefore conspired singular manner favor john blackmore 
yet another coincidence 
jeffrey body found merest chance day death 
might remained undiscovered weeks even months would impossible fix date death 
mrs wilson next kin would certainly contested john blackmore claim probably success ground jeffrey died mrs wilson 
uncertainty provided circumstance mr jeffrey paid rent personally prematurely porter fourteenth march thus establishing beyond question fact alive date yet case porter memory untrustworthy statement doubted jeffrey furnished signed dated document cheque could produced court furnish incontestable proof survival 
sum part evidence 
enabled john blackmore inherit fortune man almost certainly intention bequeathing 
wording seemed adjusted peculiarities mrs wilson disease death testator occurred peculiar set circumstances seemed exactly adjusted wording 
put another way wording time manner circumstances testator death seemed precisely adjusted fact approximate date mrs wilson death known months occurred 
must admit compound group coincidences conspiring single end enrichment john blackmore singular appearance 
coincidences common enough real life accept many time 
feeling many case could accept without searching inquiry 
thorndyke paused mr marchmont listened close attention nodded glanced silent partner 
stated case remarkable clearness said free confess points raised escaped notice 
first idea thorndyke resumed john blackmore taking advantage mental enfeeblement produced opium habit dictated jeffrey sought permission inspect jeffrey chambers learn could see whether presented dirty disorderly appearance characteristic regular opium smoker den 
walk city thought case seemed explanation hardly met facts 
endeavored think explanation looking notes observed two points seemed worth considering 
one neither witnesses really acquainted jeffrey blackmore strangers accepted identity statement 
one previously known single exception brother john ever seen jeffrey inn 
import two facts probably none 
still suggested desirability considering question person signed really jeffrey blackmore contrary supposition one personated jeffrey forged signature false seemed wildly improbable especially view identification body involved actual impossibility offered complete explanation otherwise inexplicable coincidences mentioned 
however moment think true explanation resolved bear mind test opportunity arose consider light fresh facts might acquire 
new facts came sooner expected 
evening went dr jervis new inn found mr stephen chambers 
informed jeffrey learned orientalist quite expert knowledge cuneiform writing even telling looked shoulder saw cuneiform inscription hanging wall upside 
could one reasonable explanation 
disregarding fact one would screw suspension plates frame without ascertaining right way assuming hung inverted impossible misplacement could overlooked jeffrey 
blind though sight defective 
frame thirty inches long individual characters nearly inch length size letters snellen test types read person ordinary sight distance fifty five feet 
repeat one reasonable explanation person inhabited chambers jeffrey blackmore 
conclusion received considerable support fact observed later mention place 
examining soles shoes taken dead man feet found ordinary mud streets 
trace peculiar gravelly mud adhered boots jervis came square inn 
yet porter distinctly stated deceased paying rent walked back towards chambers across square mud therefore conspicuous shoes 
thus moment wildly speculative hypothesis assumed high degree probability 
mr stephen gone jervis looked chambers thoroughly another curious fact came light 
wall number fine japanese color prints showed recent damp spots 
apart consideration jeffrey trouble expense collecting valuable prints would hardly allowed rot walls arose question came damp gas stove room gas stove least virtue preserving dry atmosphere 
winter weather stove would naturally pretty constantly alight 
came walls damp answer seemed stove constantly alight lighted occasionally 
suggestion borne examination rooms 
kitchen practically stores hardly arrangements even simple bachelor cooking bedroom offered suggestion soap wash stand shrivelled cracked cast linen shirts drawers though clean peculiar yellowish faded appearance linen acquires long use 
short rooms appearance lived visited intervals 
view however statement night porter often seen light jeffrey sitting room one clock morning apparent implication turned 
light may left empty room extinction implies presence person extinguish unless automatic device adopted putting given time 
device alarm movement clock instance suitable attachment simple enough matter search rooms failed discover anything kind 
however looking drawers bedroom came upon large box held considerable quantity hard stearine candles 
left flat candlestick numerous wick ends socket accounted remainder 
candles seemed dispose difficulty 
necessary ordinary lighting since gas laid three rooms 
purpose used considerable quantities subsequently obtained brand price stearine candles six pound experimented 
candle seven quarter inches length counting cone top found burned still air rate fraction one inch hour 
may say one candles would burn still air little six hours 
would thus possible person inhabited rooms go away seven clock evening leave light would burn past one morning extinguish 
course surmise destroyed significance night porter statement 
person inhabited chambers jeffrey answer question seemed plain enough 
one person strong motive perpetrating fraud kind one person possible 
person jeffrey must like jeffrey sufficiently like body one mistaken body 
production jeffrey body essential part plan must contemplated first 
person fulfills conditions john blackmore 
learned mr stephen john jeffrey though different appearance later years much alike young men 
two brothers much alike young men become unlike later life shall find unlikeness produced superficial differences essential likeness remains 
thus present case jeffrey clean shaved bad eyesight wore spectacles stooped walked john wore beard moustache good eyesight wear spectacles brisk gait upright carriage 
supposing john shave beard moustache put spectacles stoop walk conspicuous superficial differences would vanish original likeness reappear 
another consideration 
john actor actor experience 
person care practice make disguise great difficulty support disguise suitable manner voice 
experienced actor difficulty exist 
personation easy moreover actor precisely person idea disguise impersonation would occur 
small item bearing point small hardly worth calling evidence worth noting 
pocket waistcoat taken body jeffrey found stump contango pencil pencil sold use stock dealers brokers 
john outside broker might probably used pencil whereas jeffrey connection stock markets reason possessed pencil kind 
fact merely suggestive evidential value 
important inference drawn collected signatures 
remarked change signature occurred abruptly one two alterations manner last september two distinct forms intermediate varieties 
remarkable suspicious 
remark made mr britton furnishes really valuable piece evidence point considering 
admitted character signature undergone change observed change affect individual personal character writing 
important handwriting extension personality writer 
man extent snares personality near blood relations form family resemblances handwriting often shows subtle likeness near relatives 
must noticed commonly handwriting one brother resembles another peculiar subtle way 
inference mr britton statement signature forged probably forged relative deceased 
relative question brother john 
facts therefore pointed john blackmore person occupied chambers accordingly adopted view working hypothesis 
pure speculation objected mr winwood 
speculation said thorndyke 
hypothesis 
ordinary inductive reasoning employ scientific research 
started purely tentative hypothesis person signed jeffrey blackmore 
assumed may say believe time merely adopted proposition worth testing 
accordingly tested yes new fact new fact said yes fact said definitely probability increased rapidly sort geometrical progression 
probabilities multiplied one another 
perfectly sound method one knows hypothesis true lead one sooner later crucial fact truth demonstrated 
resume argument 
set proposition john blackmore tenant new inn personating jeffrey 
let us reason see leads 
tenant new inn john jeffrey must elsewhere since concealment inn clearly impossible 
could far away producible short notice whenever death mrs wilson make production body necessary 
producible person must possession control john 
could large would involved danger seen recognized 
could institution place would contact strangers 
must sort confinement 
difficult keep adult confinement ordinary house 
proceeding would involve great risk discovery use violence would leave traces body observed commented inquest 
alternative method could suggested obvious method keeping prisoner state debility would confine bed 
debility could produced starvation unsuitable food chronic poisoning 
alternatives poisoning much exact calculable effect control 
probabilities favor chronic poisoning 
reached stage recalled singular case jervis mentioned seemed illustrate method 
return home asked particulars gave detailed description patient circumstances 
upshot rather startling 
looked case merely illustrative wished study sake suggestions might offer 
heard account began suspect something mere parallelism method 
began look patient mr graves might actually jeffrey blackmore 
coincidences remarkable 
general appearance patient tallied completely mr stephen description uncle jeffrey 
patient tremulous iris right eye clearly suffered dislocation crystalline lens 
mr stephen account uncle sudden loss sight right eye fall judged jeffrey also suffered dislocation lens therefore tremulous iris right eye 
patient graves evidently defective vision left eye proved marks made behind ears hooked side bars spectacles spectacles intended constant use find hooked side bars 
jeffrey defective vision left eye wore spectacles constantly 
lastly patient graves suffering chronic morphine poisoning morphine found body jeffrey 
appeared many coincidences 
question whether graves jeffrey identical admitted fairly easy disproof graves still alive could jeffrey 
important question resolved test without delay 
night jervis plotted chart following morning located house 
empty let 
birds flown failed discover whither gone 
however entered house explored 
told massive bolts fastenings found bedroom doors window showing room used prison 
told objects picked dust heap grate 
obvious suggestion offered japanese brush bottle spirit gum cement need speak must trouble details concerning broken spectacles 
come upon crucial fact said sound inductive reasoning brings one sooner later 
spectacles rather peculiar pattern 
frames type invented mr stopford moorfields known name 
right eye piece fitted plain glass usual case blind useless eye 
much shattered character obvious 
glass left eye much thicker fortunately less damaged able accurately test refraction 
reached home laid pieces spectacles together measured frames carefully tested left eye glass wrote full description would given surgeon spectacle maker 
ask note carefully 
spectacles constant use

spectacles see distinctive character seemed offer good chance identification 
stopford frames believe made one firm opticians london parry cuxton regent street 
therefore wrote mr cuxton knows asking supplied spectacles late jeffrey blackmore esq 
copy letter whether would mind letting full description together name oculist prescribed 
replied letter pinned copy mine four years ago supplied pair glasses mr jeffrey blackmore described thus spectacles constant use steel frames stopford pattern curl sides length side bars including curled ends

spectacles prescribed mr hindley wimpole street 
see mr cuxton description identical mine 
however confirmation wrote mr hindley asking certain questions replied thus quite right 
mr jeffrey blackmore tremulous iris right eye practically blind due dislocation lens 
pupils rather large certainly contracted 
three important facts 
one spectacles found us kennington lane undoubtedly jeffrey unlikely exists another pair spectacles exactly identical exists another face exactly like jeffrey face 
second fact description jeffrey tallies completely sick man graves given dr jervis third jeffrey seen mr hindley sign addicted taking morphine 
first second facts agree constitute complete identification 
yes said marchmont think must admit identification quite conclusive though evidence kind striking medical legal mind 
complaint make next item evidence said thorndyke 
lawyer heart shall hear 
days ago wrote mr stephen asking possessed recent photograph uncle jeffrey 
one sent return 
portrait showed dr jervis asked ever seen person represented 
examining attentively without hint whatever identified portrait sick man graves 
indeed exclaimed marchmont 
important 
prepared swear identity dr jervis slightest doubt replied portrait mr graves 
excellent said marchmont rubbing hands gleefully much convincing jury 
pray go dr thorndyke 
said thorndyke completes first part investigation 
reached definite demonstrable fact fact see disposed main question genuineness 
man kennington lane jeffrey blackmore man new inn 
latter signed 
therefore signed jeffrey blackmore say forgery 
case complete purposes civil proceedings rest investigations reference criminal prosecution inevitable 
shall proceed interest confined hang exclaimed stephen 
want hear propose lay hands villain murdered poor old uncle jeffrey suppose murder think doubt replied thorndyke 
said marchmont hear rest argument please 
well said thorndyke 
evidence stands proved jeffrey blackmore prisoner house kennington lane one personating new inn 
one seen probability john blackmore 
consider man weiss 
connect way new inn may note passing weiss coachman apparently one person 
never seen together 
weiss present coachman available even urgent service obtaining antidote poison 
weiss always appeared time jervis arrival disappeared time departure case sufficiently long allow change disguise 
need labor point primary importance 
return weiss 
clearly heavily disguised see unwillingness show even light candle 
item positive evidence point important bearings 
furnished spectacles worn weiss heard jervis description 
spectacles peculiar optical properties 
looked properties plain glass looked appearance lenses 
one kind glass possesses properties namely like ordinary watch glass curved parallel surfaces 
purpose could person wear watch glass spectacles clearly assist vision 
alternative disguise 
properties spectacles introduce curious interesting feature case 
majority persons wearing spectacles purpose disguise personation seems perfectly simple easy proceeding 
person normal eyesight nothing kind 
wears spectacles suited long sight see distinctly wears concave near sight glasses effort see produces strain fatigue eyes become disabled altogether 
stage difficulty met using spectacles plain window glass real life would hardly property spectacles would detected give rise suspicion 
personator therefore dilemma wears actual spectacles see wears sham spectacles plain glass disguise probably detected 
one way difficulty satisfactory one mr weiss seems adopted lieu better 
using watch glass spectacles described 
learn peculiar glasses first place confirm opinion weiss wearing disguise 
use room dimly lighted ordinary stage spectacles would answered quite well 
second inference spectacles prepared worn trying conditions light doors instance 
third inference weiss man normal eyesight otherwise could worn real spectacles suited state vision 
inferences way may return 
glasses furnish much important suggestion 
floor bedroom new inn found fragments glass trodden 
joining one two together able make general character object formed parts 
assistant formerly watch maker judged object thin crystal glass lady watch think jervis opinion 
small part remains original edge furnishes proof two respects watch glass 
first place taking careful tracing piece edge found curve part ellipse watch glasses nowadays invariably circular 
second place watch glasses ground edge single bevel snap bezel frame edge object ground double bevel like edge spectacle glass fits groove frame held side bar screw 
inevitable inference spectacle glass 
part pair spectacles identical properties worn mr weiss 
importance conclusion emerges consider exceptional character mr weiss spectacles 
merely peculiar remarkable probably unique 
exceedingly likely entire world another similar pair spectacles 
whence finding fragments glass bedroom establishes considerable probability mr weiss time chambers new inn 
let us gather threads part argument 
inquiring identity man weiss 
first place find committing secret crime john blackmore alone benefit 
suggests prima facie probability john blackmore 
find man normal eyesight wearing spectacles purpose disguise 
tenant new inn seen almost certainly john blackmore present assume john blackmore man normal eyesight wore spectacles disguise 
john blackmore reside new inn place within easy reach 
weiss resided place within easy reach new inn 
john blackmore must possession control person jeffrey 
weiss possession control person jeffrey 
weiss wore spectacles certain peculiar probably unique character 
portions spectacles found chambers new inn 
overwhelming probability therefore weiss tenant new inn one person person john blackmore 
said mr winwood plausible argument 
observe sir contains undistributed middle term 
thorndyke smiled genially 
think forgave winwood everything remark 
quite right sir said 

reason demonstration absolute 
must forget logicians seem occasionally overlook undistributed middle interferes absolute proof may quite consistent degree probability approaches near certainty 
bertillon system english fingerprint system involve process reasoning middle term undistributed 
great probabilities accepted practice equivalent certainties 
mr winwood grunted grudging assent thorndyke resumed furnished fairly conclusive evidence three heads proved sick man graves jeffrey blackmore tenant new inn john blackmore man weiss also john blackmore 
prove john jeffrey together chambers new inn night jeffrey death 
know two persons two persons came kennington lane new inn 
one persons tenant new inn john blackmore 
jeffrey known us kennington lane 
body found following morning room new inn 
third person known come kennington lane third person known arrived new inn 
inference exclusion second person woman jeffrey 
jeffrey brought kennington inn john 
john personating jeffrey made resemble closely 
jeffrey undisguised two men would almost exactly alike would noticeable case suspicious death one 
therefore jeffrey would disguised way disguise could simpler effective one suggest used unavoidable one cabman know jeffrey alone came inn night 
fact leaked become known man accompanied chambers suspicion might arisen suspicion would pointed john directly interested brother death 
transpired jeffrey accompanied woman would less suspicion suspicion would pointed john blackmore 
thus general probabilities favor hypothesis woman jeffrey blackmore 
however item positive evidence strongly supports view 
examined clothing deceased found trousers horizontal crease leg trousers turned half way knees 
appearance quite understandable suppose trousers worn skirt turned accidentally seen 
otherwise quite incomprehensible 
rather strange said marchmont jeffrey allowed dressed remarkable manner think replied thorndyke 
reason suppose knew dressed 
heard jervis description condition mere automaton 
know without spectacles practically blind could worn since found house kennington lane 
probably head wrapped veil skirt mantle put afterwards case condition rendered practically devoid power 
evidence prove unknown woman jeffrey 
conclusive convincing enough purpose seeing case john blackmore depend upon 
case charge murder presume said stephen 
undoubtedly 
notice statements made supposed jeffrey porter hinting suicide important evidence 
light know announcement intended suicide becomes announcement intended murder 
conclusively disproves intended prove jeffrey died hand 
yes see said stephen pause asked identify mrs schallibaum told us nothing 
considered outside case far concerned replied thorndyke 
accessory business principal 
course swept net 
evidence convicts john blackmore convict 
troubled identity 
john blackmore married probably wife 
happen know married yes mrs john blackmore much like mrs schallibaum excepting cast left eye 
dark woman heavy eyebrows 
say differs mrs schallibaum peculiarities artificially changed resembles one feature unchangeable 
know christian name happens pauline yes 
miss pauline hagenbeck member american theatrical company 
made ask name jervis heard poor jeffrey struggling pronounce seemed resemble pauline name 
one little point strikes said marchmont 
rather remarkable porter noticed difference body jeffrey living man knew sight must distinctly different appearance glad raised question thorndyke replied difficulty presented beginning case 
thinking decided imaginary difficulty assuming good deal resemblance two men 
put porter place follow mental processes 
informed dead man lying bed mr blackmore rooms 
naturally assumes dead man mr blackmore way hinted suicide night 
idea enters chambers sees man good deal like mr blackmore wearing mr blackmore clothes lying mr blackmore bed 
idea body could person never entered mind 
notes difference appearance put effects death every one knows man dead looks somewhat different man alive 
take evidence great acuteness part john blackmore calculated cleverly mental process porter erroneous reasoning every one would base porter conclusions 
since body actually jeffrey identified porter tenant assumed every one question possible identity jeffrey blackmore tenant new inn 
brief silence marchmont asked may take heard evidence yes replied thorndyke 
case 
given information police stephen asked eagerly 
yes 
soon obtained statement cabman ridley felt enough evidence secure conviction called scotland yard interview assistant commissioner 
case hands superintendent miller criminal investigation department acute energetic officer 
expecting hear warrant executed mr miller usually punctilious keeping informed progress cases introduce 
shall hear morrow doubt 
present said marchmont case seems passed hands 
shall enter caveat said mr winwood 
seem necessary marchmont objected 
evidence heard amply sufficient ensure conviction plenty police go case 
conviction charges forgery murder would course invalidate second 
shall enter caveat repeated mr winwood 
two partners showed disposition become heated question thorndyke suggested might discuss leisure light subsequent events 
acting hint close upon midnight visitors prepared depart fact making way towards door bell rang 
thorndyke flung open door recognized visitor greeted evident satisfaction
