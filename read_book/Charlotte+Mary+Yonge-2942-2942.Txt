guard hindered passage longer jean led way spiral stairs 
slit looking court heard cries clash arms high heads anything seen hastened 
also narrow court fight going nearly ended 
geordie douglas knelt prostrate form rudiger von balchenburg calling yield meeting answer

hurried meal made victors set descent 
george found good steed stables together ladies palfreys great joy mutual recognition jean horse found show traces fall arm yet entirely recovered seated ringan sure footed pony new made knight walking side secure every step though ringan grumbled sheltie would far safer left wits 
sigismund proposing make sarrebourg glittering lances seen distance troop drawn closely together chance already thought probable lorrainers risen war invasion 
however banner soon became distinguishable many quarterings showing king rene person sigismund rode forward greet explain 
chivalrous king delighted adventure wishing shared rescue captive princesses 
young blood said 
youth guerdons reserved age lagging behind 
yet soon sir patrick drummond overtaken epinal turned back nanci consequence heard set forth bring robbers balchenburg reason

petronelle first become alarmed 
quite resumed authority position promised protection employment barbe trudchen 
former tears boy thus cut sins always foreboded old master thankful grace offered 
king rene believed word nephew intended conduct ladies court sister see safety 
jean however first excitement drooped rode entirely unable make answer kindness around plain must rest soon possible thus hospitality asked little country castle around suite encamped 
pursuivant however despatched rene french court announce deliverance princesses sir patrick sent son david party wife poor dauphiness might fully reassured 
strange stillness chateau le surry david rode triumphantly gate 
scottish archer stood guard looked anxiously words weel lassies reply sain safe thanks heaven geordie douglas angus man exclaimed sir squire saints grant ye may late puir dolfine ah sair misguided 
mother asked david 
ay sir puir lady

doors open ilka loon may win see princess die 
pursuivant hearing king dauphin longer castle rode chalons david dismounted followed stream persons chiefly monks friars women burgher class steps vaulted room lower part shut rail crowded curious half awed multitude whispered temporary altar bright rows candles priests intoned prayers 
atmosphere insufferably hot david could hardly push forward exclaimed imperfect french came tidings madame sisters way made heard mother voice

poor margaret case etiquette banished nearest kin royalty articulo mortis much regretted 
david saw white save death flush called laboring breath lay upheld mother arms priest holding crucifix ladies kneeling bed

alack yet madame come days time

chapter 
sorrow ended done death slanderous tongues hero lies death avenger wrongs gives fame never dies 
much ado nothing 
day rest revived jean enough make eager push chalons enough likewise revive coquettish petulant temper 
sigismund eleanor might ride together species paradise love acted bit romance come full realisation much often days modern ones 
quite content let king rene glory almost much arrived daughter ferry could fully secure sigismund one consent ask save formal licence cousin emperor frederick iii would pronounce fool wedding penniless princess real power eleanor certain kindred would feel fulfilling destiny high sweet thoughts thankfulness longing blessing loved ruled filled spirit rode shady woods breezy glades bright early summer 
jean however galled thought every one home would smile say might spared journey spite beauty ended wedding scottish laddie scorned 
true heart knew loved none truly merited pride willing feel earned matter course quite ungracious sir george douglas master angus ever geordie red peel showed petulance semi convalescent 
would let ride beside horse made palfrey restless said king rene talked true knight pretended understand 
ah said consoled brave sire know part fair lady cruel merciless 
let sing roman sad true good natured speech simply irritated george beyond bearing 
daft old carle muttered sir patrick let gang gate instead bringing prying eyes jean casts noo fault 
small vexations however soon faded sight drooping half hoisted banner seen turrets chateau le surry clang knell came slow solemn wind 
one first visible probably warder announced approach various figures issued gateway coming rene david drummond seeking father 
tidings one moment made known two poor girls sudden shock parted sister full health thought sir patrick supposed chilled thunderstorm 
yet eleanor first thought ah knew would clung closer never parted 
next moment startled cry jean slid horse fainting away george douglas arms 
madame de ste 
petronelle hand lady glenuskie quickly spot carried hall revived soon floods tears 
days violent demonstration unchecked admired due deceased stood round weeping 
king charles leaning forward wring hands cry daughter good daughter soon first tempest subsided king supported eleanor chapel midst rows huge wax candles margaret lay placid face hands clasped crucifix tomb pall covered except face embellished sides blazonry france scotland 
husband thin hands clasped knelt head requiems sung around relays priests 
fresh weeping wailing sisters cast sprinklings holy water jean sinking quite exhausted supported away chamber sisters could hear story last sad days lady drummond 
solemnities margaret funeral took due course lengthy one rather throughout consideration come next 
late court seemed wakened regret margaret 
open handed kindly attendants loved ladies gossiped habits found occupation tongues indignation whosoever aspersed discretion 
king always lazily fond belle fille could amuse stirred perhaps rene inquiry scandalous reports result jamet de tillay ignominiously banished court margaret fair fame vindicated late save heart breaking 
displeasure charles expressed son private score poor margaret wrongs fact believed beginning breach widened continually till finally unhappy father starved death morbid dread poisoned son 
however present two scottish princesses reaped full benefit feeling sister 
king queen called dearest daughters made sorts promises marrying endowing louis went outwardly forms mourning devotion treated two fair sisters extreme civility privately declared could hardly bear recollected behaved margaret 
jean especial flouted sharpness pertness capable would received smiling indifference civility exasperated 
laird lady glenuskie difficulty 
could well much longer absent scotland yet lilias promised poor dauphiness leave sisters except security 
eleanor fate plain enough sigismund followed betrothed question whether period mourning go back dominions collect train worthy marriage king daughter plainly reluctant 
besides unwillingness lover lose sight lady catastrophe befallen sisters might well leave sense needed protection 
perhaps might expect murmurs choice dowerless princess vassals tirol 
rate lingered accompanied court tours noble old castle winter spent 
sir patrick wife holding consultation 
means well nigh exhausted 
collected journey nearly spent sum cardinal beaufort furnished nieces 
true eleanor jean reckoned guests french king knight lady attendants part suite high proud scottish spirits could easy condition longed depart still selling merely ornamental horses jewels could pay journey 
jean remained difficulty 
take back scotland obvious measure could marry george angus soon mourning ended

oh cousins cousins tak away reach 
death poor meg wants mine 
could understand first indeed shame well dismay made incoherent proposed time unprecedented 
hard believe yet french historians aver dauphin louis actually thought obtaining dispensation marrying 
unsettled condition church divided last splinterings great schism perhaps astute louis deemed prince might obtain anything whichever rival pope chose acknowledge though reserved alexander borgia grant first licence kind 
jean idea simply abhorrent alike regarded instincts sake man 
sneering manner towards sister filled disgust indignation days equally contemptuous towards besides aware share capture balchenburg whispers respected manner silence fostered slanders broken margaret heart 
would sooner wed viper said 
louis motive hard guess 
perhaps real admiration jean beauty seems desire wife nonentity shown subsequent choice charlotte savoy 
jean feature like sister isabel duchess brittany beautiful woman far imbecile louis never seen jean display superiority intellect taste like margaret eleanor rather impatience pursuits therefore might expect equally simple sister 
however might sir patrick utterly incredulous wife asked madame ste
