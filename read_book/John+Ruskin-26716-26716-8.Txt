practical enough statement one would think english public possessed modern school economists notion business always good whether busy mischief benefit buying selling always salutary whatever intrinsic worth buy sell seems impossible gain much patient hearing inquiry respecting substantial result eager modern labors 
never felt checked sense impossibility arranging heads following three lectures though delivered considerable intervals time different places prepared without reference 
connection would however made far distinct prevented feel another great difficulty addressing english audiences enforcing decision common important part subjects

first distinction classes work classes play 
course must agree upon definition terms work play going farther 
roughly vain subtlety definition plain use words play exertion body mind made please determined end work thing done ought done determined end 
play call cricket instance 
hard work anything else amuses result amusement

like manner whatever please sake pleasure ultimate object play pleasing thing useful thing 
play may useful secondary sense nothing indeed useful necessary use depends spontaneous 
let us enquire together sort games playing class england spend lives playing 
first english games making money 
absorbing game knock oftener playing foot ball roughest sport absolutely without purpose one engages heartily game ever knows 
ask great money maker wants money never knows 
make anything 
gets may get 
make got ask 
well get says 
cricket get runs 
use runs get people game 
use money people game 
great foul city london rattling growling smoking stinking ghastly heap fermenting brick work pouring poison every pore fancy city work street great city play nasty play hard play still play 
lord cricket ground without turf huge billiard table without cloth pockets deep bottomless pit mainly billiard table 
well first great english game playing counters 
differs rest appears always producing money every game expensive 
always produce money 
great difference winning money making great difference getting another man pocket filling 
collecting money means thing making tax gatherer house mint much apparent gain called commerce form taxation carriage exchange 
next great english game however hunting shooting costly altogether much fined annually land horses gamekeepers game laws else accompanies beautiful special english game endeavor count note except exercise merely useless game deadly one connected 
horse racing get every form higher classes everywhere call play distinction plays gambling means beneficial recreative game game preserving get also curious laying ground beautiful arrangement dwelling house man beast grouse black cock many brace acre men women many brace garret 
often wonder angelic builders surveyors angelic builders build many mansions angelic surveyors measured four square city measuring reeds wonder think supposed think laying ground nation set seems literally accomplish word word rather fact word persons poor master left represent master said foxes birds homes none 
next gentlemen game hunting must put ladies game dressing 
cheapest games 
saw brooch jeweller bond street fortnight ago inch wide without singular jewel yet worth l wish could tell play costs altogether england france russia annually 
pretty game certain terms like nay see played quite much would fain 
ladies like lead fashion means lead lead thoroughly lead far enough 
dress nicely dress everybody else nicely 
lead fashions poor first make look well look ways conception better 
fashions set time among peasantry pretty ones doublets irregularly slashed wind blows frankly 
games wild enough could show time 
playing literature playing art different working literature working art time speak 
pass greatest play plays great gentlemen game ladies like best play game war 
entrancingly pleasant imagination facts always pleasant 
dress however finely sport go merely scarlet hunt scarlet gold manner fine colors course could fight better gray without feathers nations agreed good well dressed play 
bats balls costly english french bats balls wickets even make use costing suppose fifteen millions money annually nation know paid hard labourer work furrow furnace 
costly game speak consequences say present nothing 
mere immediate cost plays want consider cost deadly work somewhere many us know well 
jewel cutter whose sight fails diamonds weaver whose arm fails web iron forger whose breath fails furnace know work work none play except kind named black north country play means laid sickness 
pretty example philologists varying dialect change sense word play used black country birmingham red black country baden baden 
yes gentlemen gentlewomen england think one moment unamused misery made feeble man brought word play mean heart merry england may fluting piping sad children sitting market place indeed say piped unto ye danced eternally shall say mourned unto ye lamented 
first distinction upper lower classes 
one means necessary indeed must process good time honest men consent abolished 
men taught existence play sustained blood creatures good existence gnats sucking fish men neither days lives made holy nothing best prayer beginning day may lose moments best grace meat consciousness justly earned dinner 
much plain christianity preached us enough respect regard inspiration think son go work day vineyard means fool go play day vineyard shall workers one way another much least distinction upper lower forgotten

see reason thinking lazarus christianity advantage jewish one 
jewish lazarus expected least prayed fed crumbs rich man table lazarus fed crumbs dog table 
distinction rich poor rests two bases 
within proper limits basis lawful everlastingly necessary beyond basis unlawful everlastingly corrupting framework society 
lawful basis wealth man works paid fair value work choose spend day free leave keep spend morrow 
thus industrious man working daily laying daily attains last possession accumulated sum wealth absolute right 
idle person work wasteful person lays nothing end time doubly poor poor possession dissolute moral habit naturally covet money saved 
allowed attack rob well earned wealth motive saving reward good conduct society thereupon dissolved exists systems rapine 
therefore first necessity social life clearness national conscience enforcing law keep justly earned 
law say proper basis distinction rich poor 
also false basis distinction namely power held earn wealth levy exact 
always number men would fain set accumulation wealth sole object lives 
necessarily class men uneducated class inferior intellect less cowardly 
physically impossible well educated intellectual brave man make money chief object thoughts physically impossible make dinner principal object 
healthy people like dinners dinner main object lives 
healthily minded people like making money ought like enjoy sensation winning main object life money something better money 
good soldier instance mainly wishes fighting well 
glad pay properly justly grumbles keep ten years without still main notion life win battles paid winning 
clergymen 
like pew rents baptismal fees course yet brave well educated pew rent sole object lives baptismal fee sole purpose baptism clergyman object essentially baptize preach paid preaching 
doctors 
like fees doubt ought like yet brave well educated entire object lives fees 
whole desire cure sick good doctors choice fairly put would rather cure patient lose fee kill get 
brave rightly trained men work first fee second important always still second 
every nation said vast class ill educated cowardly less stupid 
people certainly fee first work second brave people work first fee second 
small distinction 
whole distinction man distinction life death heaven hell 
serve two masters must serve one 
work first fee second work master lord work god 
fee first work second fee master lord fee devil devil lowest devils least erected fiend fell 
brief terms work first god servants fee first fiend makes difference ever believe whether serve vesture thigh written king kings whose service perfect freedom whose vesture thigh name written slave slaves whose service perfect slavery 
however every nation must always certain number fiend servants principally object lives make money 
always said less stupid conceive anything else nice money 
stupidity always basis judas bargain 
great injustice iscariot thinking wicked common wickedness 
common money lover like money lovers understand christ make worth meaning 
want killed 
horror struck found christ would killed threw money away instantly hanged 
many present money seekers think would grace hang whoever killed judas common selfish muddle headed pilfering fellow hand always bag poor caring 
understand christ yet believed much us seen miracles thought quite strong enough shift judas might well make little bye perquisites affair 
christ would come well enough thirty pieces 
money seeker idea world 
hate christ understand care sees good benevolent business makes little job events come 
thus every mass men certain number bag men fee first men whose main object make money 
make make sorts unfair ways chiefly weight force money called power capital say power money obtained labor poor capitalist take produce except labourer food 
modern judas way carrying bag bearing put therein 
nay asked unfair advantage man worked money right use best respect money exactly mountain promontories public roads old times 
barons fought fairly strongest cunningest got fortified made everyone passed pay toll 
well capital exactly crags 
men fight fairly least grant much though ought money got fortified millionaire make everybody passes pay toll million build another tower money castle 
tell poor vagrants roadside suffer quite much bag baron ever crag baron 
bags crags result rags 
time however night show many ways power capital unjust one great principle assert find quite indisputably true whenever money principal object life either man nation got ill spent ill harm getting spending principal object things well got well spent 
test every man whether money principal object 
mid life could pause say enough live upon live upon well earned also well spend go world poor came money principal enough live upon manner befitting character rank still wants make die rich money principal object becomes curse generally spend 
know must spent day question whether man makes shall spend one else 
generally better maker spend know best value use 
true law life 
man choose thus spend money must either hoard lend worst thing generally lend borrowers nearly always ill spenders lent money evil mainly done unjust war protracted 
observe real fact respecting loans foreign military governments strange 
little boy came ask money spend squibs crackers would think twice gave would idea wasted saw fly fireworks even though mischief 
russian children austrian children come borrowing money spend innocent squibs cartridges bayonets attack india keep noble life italy murder polish women children give pay interest 
order pay interest must tax every working peasant dominions work live 
therefore rob austrian peasant assassinate banish polish peasant live produce theft bribe assassination broad fact practical meaning foreign loans large interest money quarrel bishop colenso forsooth denied bible believed though wretches every deliberate act lives new defiance primary orders rich men england moment indeed desired best thing least bible true since words written rust gold silver shall witness shall eat flesh fire

pass third condition separation men work hand work head 
last inevitable distinction 
must work done arms none us could live 
must work done brains life get would worth 
men 
rough work done rough men must gentle work done gentlemen must physically impossible one class divide work 
use try conceal sorrowful fact fine words talk workman honourableness manual labor dignity humanity 
grand old proverb sancho panza fine words butter parsnips tell england workmen buying great deal much butter dairy 
rough work honorable takes life us man heaving clay ditch day driving express train north wind night holding collier helm gale lee shore whirling white hot iron furnace mouth man end day night one sitting quiet room everything comfortable reading books classing butterflies painting pictures 
comfort told rough work honorable two sorry take much consolation sense need 
rough work events real honest generally though always useful fine work great deal foolish false well fine therefore dishonourable kinds equally well worthily done head noble work hand ignoble hand work whatsoever necessary maintenance life old words sweat thy face thou shalt eat bread indicate inherent nature one calamity ground cursed sake casts also shadow degradation contest thorn thistle nations held days honorable holy constituted holydays holidays making days rest promise among distant hopes seems cast chief brightness death blessing dead die lord rest labors works follow 
thus perpetual question contest must arise rough work worker comforted redeemed rewarded kind play rest world sometimes well next well good working friends questions take little time answer yet 
must answered good men occupied honest thinkers 
grand head work much must discovered much attempted vain anything decisive told 
note particulars already sure 
distribution hard work 
none us us either hard soft work think ought chanced fall way help

men enlisted labor kills labor war counted trained fed dressed praised

teach plough exercise carefully sword exercise let officers troops life held much gentlemen officers troops death done neither right thing accomplished even see way unless first servant master resolved come justice 
people perpetually squabbling best easiest adviseablest profitablest never far hear talk ever ask 
law heaven shall able judge wise easy unless first resolved judge 
one thing constantly reiterated master order others given oftenest justice judgment 
bible order service god praying psalm singing 
told indeed sing psalms merry pray need anything perversion evil spirit get think praying psalm singing service 
child finds want anything runs asks father call father service begs toy piece cake call serving father god prayer likes hear likes ask cake want call serving 
begging serving god likes mere beggars little likes honest servants beggars 
child loves father much happy may sing little songs call serving father neither singing songs god serving god 
enjoying anything probably nothing anything serving god 
yet impudent enough call beggings chauntings divine service say divine service performed word form gone eleven clock 
alas unless perform divine service every willing act life never perform 
one divine work one ordered sacrifice justice last ever inclined 
anything rather much charity choose justice 
nay say charity greater justice 
yes greater summit justice temple justice foundation 
top without bottom build upon charity 
must build upon justice main reason first charity build

justice brother whether love come love 
injustice love come hate 
fine think build upon charity begin find got begin begins home essentially love

right charity charity beginning home 
come poor little crossing sweeper got also sunday dress dirtiest rags may beg better shall give penny think good 
charity going abroad 
justice say walking watching near us christian justice strangely mute seemingly blind blind decrepit many day keeps accounts still however quite steadily nights carefully bandage acutest spectacles modern scientific invention cares

iv 
must go however last head concerning workers 
wise work foolish work difference sense nonsense daily occupation well wise work briefly work god 
foolish work work god 
work done god help may briefly described putting order enforcing god law order spiritual material men things 
first thing essentially real good work respect men enforce justice respect things enforce tidiness fruitfulness 
two great human deeds justice order perpetually two great demons contending devil iniquity inequity devil disorder death death consummation disorder 
fight two fiends daily 
far fight fiend iniquity work 
work iniquity judgment upon lord lord depart ye work iniquity 
far resist fiend disorder work disorder work death sin wages death 
observe wise work mainly threefold character 
honest useful cheerful 
honest 
hardly know anything strange recognize honesty play work 
lightest games always one see call fair play 
boxing must hit fair racing start fair 
english watchword fair play english hatred foul play 
ever strike wanted another watchword also fair work another hatred also foul work prize fighter honor yet men ring round judge lose match foul hitting 
prize merchant gains match foul selling one cries 
drive gambler gambling room loads dice leave tradesman flourishing business loads scales observe dishonest dealing loading scales 
matter whether get short weight adulterate substance dishonest fabric fault fabric incomparably worst two 
give short measure food lose give adulterate food die 
chief duty workmen tradesmen true us would help 
nothing without honesty 
get get without suffrages reforms free trade measures institutions science vain 
useless put heads together put hearts together 
shoulder shoulder right hand right hand among wrong hand anybody else win world yet 
ii 
secondly wise work useful 
man minds ought mind hard comes something hard comes nothing bees business turns spiders honeycomb resultant cobweb blown away next breeze cruel thing worker

vulgar economist would reply science nothing qualities pictures exchange value business exclusively consider whether remains tintoret worth many ten sixpences impressions might taken lithographic stones

dull economist would perceive admit gentleman fine stud horses absolutely richer one ill bred broken winded ones 
would instinctively feel though pseudo science never taught price paid animals either case alter fact worth good horse though might bought chance guineas therefore less valuable owner galled jade richer given hundred 
economist saying science takes account qualities pictures merely signifies conceive quality essential badness goodness existing pictures incapable investigating laws wealth articles 
fact 
incapable defining intrinsic value pictures follows must equally helpless define nature intrinsic value painted glass painted pottery patterned stuffs national produce requiring true human ingenuity 
nay though capable conceiving idea intrinsic value respect beasts burden economist endeavored state general principles national economy even regard horse ass 
fine modern political economists without exception incapable apprehending nature intrinsic value

similarly vulgar political economy asserts law wages determined competition

real supposed cases called law vulgar political economy absolutely set defiance 
set law gravitation defiance determine house allow ice melt temperature thirty two degrees

maintenance state understood support population healthy happy life increase numbers far increase consistent happiness 
object political economy increase numbers nation cost common health comfort increase indefinitely comfort individuals sacrifice surrounding lives possibilities life 

assumption lies root nearly erroneous reasoning political economy namely object accumulate money exchangeable property may shown words without foundation

purpose however first apprehended found resolve finally service man say extension defense comfort life

accumulation money exchangeable property certain means extending existence would useless discussing economical questions fix attention upon distant object life instead immediate one money

whatever truly serves either purposes useful man wholesome healthful helpful holy 
seeking things man prolongs increases life upon earth

shall first chapter shortly sketch range subjects come us follow three branches inquiry 

first wealth said consists things essentially valuable 
therefore need definition value 
value signifies strength availing anything towards sustaining life always twofold say primarily intrinsic secondarily effectual 
reader must anticipation warned confusing value cost price 
value life giving power anything cost quantity labor required produce price quantity labor possessor take exchange 
cost price commercial conditions studied head money 

intrinsic value absolute power anything support life 
sheaf wheat given quality weight measurable power sustaining substance body cubic foot pure air fixed power sustaining warmth cluster flowers given beauty fixed power enlivening animating senses heart 
least affect intrinsic value wheat air flowers men refuse despise 
used power particular power nothing else 

order value may become effectual certain state necessary recipient 
digesting breathing perceiving functions must perfect human creature food air flowers become full value 
production effectual value therefore always involves two needs first production thing essentially useful production capacity use 
intrinsic value acceptant capacity come together effectual value wealth either intrinsic value acceptant capacity effectual value say wealth 
horse wealth us ride picture see noble thing wealth except noble person 
aptness user increases effectual value thing used increases entirety co exist perfect skill use fitness nature 

valuable material things may conveniently referred five heads land associated air water organisms

conditions value things briefly follows 
land 
value twofold first producing food mechanical power secondly object sight thought producing intellectual power 
value means producing food mechanical power varies form mountain plain substance soil mineral contents climate 
conditions intrinsic value must known complied men deal order give effectual value given time place intrinsic value fixed piece land associated lakes seas rightly treated surface substance produce precisely much food power 
second element value land beauty united conditions space form necessary exercise fullness animal life land highest value respects lying temperate climates boldly varied form removed unhealthy dangerous influences miasm volcano capable sustaining rich fauna flora 
land carefully tended hand man far remove unsightlinesses evidences decay guarded violence inhabited man affectionate protection every kind living creature occupy peace precious property human beings possess

iii 
food medicine articles luxury 
head shall examine possible methods obtaining pure food security equality supply avoid waste famine economy medicine range sanitary law finally economy luxury partly sthetic partly ethical question 

iv 
books 
value consists first power preserving communicating knowledge facts 
secondly power exciting vital noble emotion intellectual action 
also corresponding negative powers disguising effacing memory facts killing noble emotions exciting base ones 
two heads consider economical educational value positive negative literature means producing educating good authors means advisability rendering good books generally accessible directing reader choice 

v works art 
value nature books laws production possible modes distribution different require separate examination 

ii 
money 
head shall examine laws currency exchange note first principles 
money inaccurately spoken merely means exchange 
far 
documentary expression legal claim 
wealth documentary claim wealth sign relative quantities labor producing given time persons societies entitled 
money world notes gold destroyed instant would leave world neither richer poorer 
would leave individual inhabitants different relations 
money therefore correspondent nature title deed estate 
though deed burned estate still exists right become disputable 

real worth money remains unchanged long proportion quantity existing money quantity existing wealth available labor remains unchanged 
wealth increases money worth money increases money increases wealth worth money diminishes 

money therefore arbitrarily multiplied title deeds 
long existing wealth available labor fully represented currency currency may increased without diminution assigned worth pieces 
existing wealth available labor fully represented every piece money thrown circulation diminishes worth every existing piece proportion bears number provided new piece received equal credit depreciation worth takes place according degree credit 

however new money composed substance supposed intrinsic value gold brought market new notes issued supposed deserving credit desire obtain money certain circumstances stimulate industry additional quantity wealth immediately produced proportion new claims advanced value existing currency undepreciated 
stimulus given great produce goods proportioned additional coinage worth existing currency raised 
arbitrary control issues currency affect production wealth acting hopes fears men certain circumstances wise 
issue additional currency meet exigencies immediate expense merely one disguised forms borrowing taxing 
however present low state economical knowledge often possible governments venture issue currency could venture additional loan tax real operation issue understood people pressure irregularly distributed unperceived gradation 

use substances intrinsic value materials currency barbarism remnant conditions barter alone render commerce possible among savage nations 
however still necessary partly mechanical check arbitrary issues partly means exchanges foreign nations 
proportion extension civilization increase trustworthiness governments cease 
long exists phenomena cost price articles used currency mingled proper currency almost inextricable manner market worth bullion affected multitudinous accidental circumstances traced less success writers commercial operations variations true political economist engineer fortifying harbor refuge atlantic tide concern cries quarrels children dig pools fingers streams among sand 

iii 
riches 
according various industry capacity good fortune desires men obtain greater smaller share claim upon wealth world 
inequalities shares always degree necessary may either restrained law circumstance within certain limits may increase indefinitely 
moral legal restraint put upon exercise intellect stronger shrewder covetous men differences become ultimately enormous 
soon become distinct extremes one side shall manifest redundance possession manifest pressure need terms riches poverty used express opposite states contrary terms warmth cold contraries neither implies actual degree relation degrees temperature 

respecting riches economist inquire first advisable modes collection secondly advisable modes administration 
respecting collection national riches inquire first whether justified calling nation rich quantity wealth possesses relatively wealth nations large irrespectively manner distribution 
mode distribution wise affect nature riches thus king alone rich suppose croesus mausolus lydians carians therefore rich nation slave masters rich nation otherwise composed slaves called rich nation ideas certain mode distribution operation riches certain degree freedom people enter idea riches attributed people shall define degree fluency circulative character essential nature common wealth degree independence action required possessors 
questions look would take time answering 

farther 
since inequality condition riches may established two opposite modes namely increase possession one side decrease inquire respect given state riches precisely manner correlative poverty produced say whether surpassed depressed also depressed advantages contrary conceivable depression 
instance one commonest advantages rich entertain number servants inquire one side economical process produced riches master economical process produced poverty persons serve advantages side derives result 

main questions touching collection riches next last part inquiry administration 
possession involves three great economical powers require separate examination namely powers selection direction provision 
power selection relates things supply limited supply best things always 
becomes matter question things belong richest person necessarily first choice unless arbitrary mode distribution otherwise determined upon 
business economist show choice may wise one 
power direction arises necessary relation rich men poor ultimately one way another involves direction authority labor poor nearly much mental bodily labor 
business economist show direction may one 
power provision dependent upon redundance wealth may course active persons made available preparation future work future profit function riches generally received name capital say head source material 
business economist show provision may distant one 

examination three functions riches embrace every final problem political economy curious vital problem whether since wholesome action riches three functions depend appears wisdom justice farsightedness holders means assumed persons primarily rich must therefore wise may ultimately possible somewhat arrange matters persons primarily wise therefore rich general plan inquiry us shall limit consecutive following hardly good hope able complete laborious work must prove time time leisure shall endeavor carry forward part may immediately possible indicating always accuracy place particular essay take completed system 
footnotes see appendix observe definitions much importance connect sentences italics next page 
recast sentences pedantic generalization intended index statement must guard reader thinking ever wish cheapness bad quality 
poor boy need always learn mathematics set farther kindness give good compasses cheap ones whose points bend like lead 
regret ironical manner passage one great importance matter written 
gist first inquiries respecting wealth nation much whether form used possession persons use 
chapter ii 
store keeping 

first chapter consisted little definition terms purpose expand illustrate given definitions 
view taken nature wealth namely consists intrinsic value developed vital power directly opposed two nearly universal conceptions wealth 
assertion value primarily intrinsic opposes idea anything object desire numbers limited quantity rated worth exchange may called virtually become wealth 
assertion value secondarily dependent upon power possessor opposes idea worth things depends demand instead use 
going farther make two positions clearer 

first 
wealth intrinsic constituted judgment men 
easily seen case things affecting body know force fantasy make stones nourishing poison innocent less apparent things affecting mind 
easily perhaps willingly misled appearance beneficial results obtained industries addressed wholly gratification fanciful desire apt suppose whatever widely coveted dearly bought pleasurable possession must included definition wealth 
difficult quit error many things true wealth moderate use become false wealth immoderate many things mixed good evil mostly books works art one person get good another evil seems fixed good evil things view taken use made 

evil good fixed essence proportion 
things evil depends upon excess point excess though indefinable fixed power thing hither side good farther side evil 
cases power inherent dependent opinion choice 
thoughts things neither make mar eternal force serious point future consideration prevent effect within certain limits upon 

therefore object special analysis wealth much enumerate serviceable distinguish destructive show inevitably destructive receive pleasure evil thing escape alter evil altered suffer utmost nature degree made evil also 
may shown farther whatever length time subtleties connexion harm accomplished also less according fineness worth humanity wrought still nothing harm ever comes bad thing 

sum term wealth never attached accidental object morbid desire constant object legitimate one 
fury ignorance fitfulness caprice large interests may continually attached things unserviceable hurtful nature could altered passions science political economy would remain hitherto among us weighing clouds portioning shadows 
ignorance science caprice law 
disturbing forces interfere operations faithful economy nothing common calm arbiter national destiny regards essential power good accumulates alike disdains wanderings imagination thirsts disease 

ii 
secondly 
assertion wealth intrinsic dependent order become effectual given degree vital power possessor opposed another popular view wealth namely though may always constituted caprice constituted substantial thing given quantities may counted existing exchangeable rated prices 
view three errors 
first chief overlooking fact exchangeableness commodity effective demand depends sum capacity use existing elsewhere 
book read picture take delight may indeed called part wealth far power exchanging either something like better 
power effecting exchange yet effecting advantage depends absolutely number accessible persons understand book enjoy painting dispute possession 
thus actual worth either even us depends essential goodness capacity existing somewhere perception vain completed system production think obtaining one without 
though true political economist knows co existence capacity use temporary possession always secured final fact bases action administration whole nation group nations deal every atom intrinsic value produced must exactest chemistry produce twin atom acceptant digestion understanding capacity degree failure wealth 
nature challenge us earnest assyrians mock give thee two thousand horses thou able thy part set riders upon 
bavieca paces brave cid backs woe us take dust capacity wearing armor capacity procession however goodly show tomb 

second error popular view wealth giving name wealth things use reality confuse wealth money 
land skill cultivate book sealed us dress superfluous may indeed exchangeable nothing cumbrous form bank note doubtful slow convertibility 
long retain possession merely keep bank notes shape gravel clay book leaves embroidered tissue 
circumstances may perhaps render forms safest certain complacency may attach exhibition advantages shall inquire afterwards wish reader observe exchangeable property use us personally merely one forms money wealth 

third error popular view confusion guardianship possession real state men property commonly curators possessors wealth 
man power property widest range fivefold power use administration others ostentation destruction bequest possession use man sternly limited things much use indeed well wealth things ill illth 
plunged lips orinoco shall drink thirst measure peril thousand oxen lands shall eat hunger measure peril 
live two houses bales silk wool suffice fabric clothes ever wear books probably hold furniture good brain 
beyond best us narrow capacities power administering mal administering wealth say distributing lending increasing exhibiting magnificence retinue furniture destroying finally bequeathing 
multitudes rich men administration degenerates curatorship merely hold property charge trustees benefit person persons delivered upon death position explained clear terms would hardly seem covetable one 
would probable feelings youth entrance life career hoped proposed terms must work unremittingly utmost intelligence available years thus accumulate wealth large amount must touch none beyond needful support 
whatever sums gain beyond required decent moderate maintenance whatever beautiful things may obtain possession shall properly taken care servants whose maintenance charged trouble superintending deathbed shall power determining accumulated property shall belong purposes applied 

labor life conditions would probably neither zealous cheerful yet difference position ordinary capitalist power latter supposes possess attributed others spending money moment 
pleasure taken imagination power part intention parting one curious though commonest forms eidolon phantasm wealth 
political economist nothing idealism looks practical issue namely holder wealth temper may regarded simply mechanical means collection money chest slit receptant suctional set public thoroughfare chest death key evil chance distribution contents 
function lender however one administration use far concerned capitalist takes indeed interesting aspect even function relations state apt degenerate mechanism convenient contraction debt function mischievous nation invariably appeases conscience respect unjustifiable expense meeting borrowed funds expresses repentance foolish piece business letting tradesmen wait money always leaves descendants pay work least advantage 

quit three sources misconception reader little farther difficulty apprehending real nature effectual value 
may however first without surprise perceive consequences involved acceptance definition 
actual existence wealth dependent power possessor follows sum wealth held nation instead constant calculable varies hourly nay momentarily number character holders changing hands changes quantity 
farther since worth currency proportioned sum material wealth represents sum wealth changes worth currency changes 
thus sum property power currency state vary momentarily character number holders 
different rates kinds variation caused character holders different kinds wealth 
transitions value caused character holders land differ mode caused character holders works art caused character holders machinery working capital 
examine special phenomena kind wealth clear idea way true currency expresses resulting modes cost price article related value 
obtain must approach subject first elements 

let us suppose national store wealth composed material things either useful believed taken charge government every workman produced article involving labor production immediate use brings add store receiving government exchange order either return thing equivalent things may choose store time needs 
question equivalence much wine man receive return much corn much coal return much iron quite separate one examine presently 
time let assumed equivalence determined government order exchange fixed weight article called suppose either return weight article another fixed weight article b another article c 
supposing labourer speedily continually presents general orders common language spends money neither changed circumstances nation except far may produced useful consumed useless articles vice vers 
use uses part orders receives lays aside portion thus every day bringing contribution national store lays per centage orders received exchange increases national wealth daily much use received order amount accumulates monetary claim government 
course always power legal right bring forward accumulation claim consume destroy distribute sum wealth 
supposing never dies leaving claim others enriched state life quantity wealth claim extends words rendered much additional life possible state additional life bequeaths immediate possibility invests claim 
supposing cancel claim would distribute possibility life among nation large 

hitherto consider government simply conservative power taking charge wealth entrusted 
government may less conservative power 
may either improving destructive one 
improving power using wealth entrusted best advantage nation enriched root branch government enabled every order presented return quantity wealth greater order written according fructification obtained interim 
ability may either concealed case currency completely represent wealth country may manifested continual payment excess value order case irrespectively observe collateral results afterwards examined perpetual rise worth currency say fall price articles represented 

government destructive consuming power becomes unable return value received presentation order 
inability may either concealed meeting demands full issue bankruptcy form national debt may concealed oscillatory movements destructiveness productiveness result whole stability may manifested consistent return less value received presented order case consistent fall worth currency rise price things represented 

conception central government substitute body persons occupied industrial pursuits adds private capacity common store obtain approximation actual condition civilized mercantile community approximation might easily proceed still completer analysis 
purpose however arrive every result gradual expansion simpler conception wish reader observe meantime social conditions thus supposed anticipation say also possible social conditions agree two great points namely primal importance supposed national store stock destructibility improveability holders 

observe conditions central government holding diffused private holding quantity stock national moment 
one case indeed amount may known examination persons confided known exposing private affairs every individual 
known unknown significance condition 
riches nation consist abundance wealth depends nature store 

ii 
second place conditions possible ones agree destructibility improveability store holders 
whether private hands government charge national store may daily consumed daily enlarged possessors currency remains apparently unaltered property represents may diminish increase 

first question put simple conception central government namely store one equal importance whatever may constitution state second question namely holders store involves discussion constitution state 
first inquiry resolves three heads 
nature store 
quantity relation population 
quantity relation currency second inquiry two 
holders store proportions 
claimants store say holders currency proportions examine range first three questions present paper two following sequel 

question first 
nature store nation hitherto worked gathered right thing wrong issue rest possibilities life 
example let us imagine society great extent occupied procuring laying store corn wine wool silk preservable materials food clothing currency representing 
imagine farther days festivity society discovering derive satisfaction pyrotechnics gradually turns attention manufacture gunpowder increasing number labourers giving time spare branch industry bring increasing quantities combustibles store use general orders received exchange obtain wine wool corn may need 
currency remains represents precisely amount material store labor spent producing 
corn wine gradually vanish place gradually appear sulphur saltpetre till last labourers consumed corn supplied nitre presenting festal morning currency obtain materials feast discover amount currency command anything festive except fire 
supply rockets unlimited food limited quite final manner whole currency hands society represents infinite power detonation none existence 

statement caricatured may seem exaggerated assuming persistence folly extremity unchecked reality would gradual rise price food 
falls short actual facts human life expression depth intensity folly 
great part reader would believe great saw statistics detail earnest ingenious industry world spent producing munitions war gathering say materials festive consuming fire filling stores power instruments pain affluence ministries death 
true trionfo della morte men seen feared sometimes scarcely feared long wherein brought rest labors 
see share another higher form triumph 
task master instead releaser rules dust arena less tomb content grave whither man went make works cease devices vanish busy city serviceable sea makes work increase devices multiply 

doubled loss negative power labor spent producing means destruction add estimate consequences human folly whatever insidious waste toil production unnecessary luxury 
occupation said supports many labourers many obtain wages following never considered unless supporting power product occupation wages given one man merely withdrawn another 
say trade maintains number persons unless know money spent purchase produce would spent produce manufactured 
purchasing funds truly support number people making probably leave unsupported equal number making could made 
manufacturers small watches thrive geneva well would money spent small watches gone small watches buy 
frequently uttered aphorism mercantile economy labor limited capital true question would definite one 
untrue widely 
given quantity funds wages less labor according quantity inspire workman true limit labor limit moral stimulus bodily power 
ultimate entirely unpractical sense labor limited capital matter say material work practical sense labor limited great original capital head heart hand 
even artificial relations commerce labor capital fire fuel much fuel much fire much fuel shall much fire proportion mass combustible force wind fans water quenches appliance 
labor furthered conflagration much added fuel admitted air 

reasons insert qualifying probably never said positively purchase money wages fund trade withdrawn trade 
object may stimulus production money buys say work purchaser obtained means buying would done unless wanted particular thing 
production article intrinsically process manufacture injurious useful desire causes productive labor directions 

national store therefore presence things intrinsically valueless imply entirely correlative absence things valuable 
certain labor spent vanity diverted reality every bad thing produced precious thing lost 
great measure vain things represent results roused indolence carved toys extra time made nothing else would made 
even munitions war principle applies partly represent work men made spears would never made pruning hooks incapable activities contest 

thus finally nature store considered two main lights one immediate actual utility past national character signifies production future character must develop use 
issue investigation show us 
economy depend merely principles demand supply primarily demanded supplied beg observe take heart 

ii 
question second 
quantity store relation population follows already stated accurate form question put quantity article composing store exists proportion real need population shall time assume order keep terms simplest store wholly composed useful articles accurately proportioned several needs 
assumed store large proportion number people people must comfort small must distress 
active economical race always produces requires lives permitted competence produce daily labor 
quantity store great small therefore many respects indifferent inferred aspect 
similarly inactive wasteful population live daily labor dependent partly wholly consumption store may various difficulties hereafter examined realizing getting store retained state abject distress though possessions may immense 
results always involved magnitude store commercial power nation security mental character 
commercial power according quantity store may extent dealings security according quantity store means sudden exertion sustained endurance character certain conditions civilization attained without permanent continually accumulating store great intrinsic value peculiar nature 

seeing three advantages arise largeness store proportion population question arises immediately given store nation enriched diminution numbers successful national speculation pestilence economically thing part sophistical question would ask whether man richer struck disease must limit life within predicable period health 
enabled enlarge current expenses purposes larger sum immediate disposal given fortune shorter life larger annuity yet man considers richer condemned physician 

logical reply since wealth definition means life nation enriched mortality 
shorter words life meat existence wealth means existence 
whence two nations equal store numerous considered richer provided type inhabitant high though relative bulk store less relative efficiency amount effectual wealth must greater 
type population deteriorated increase numbers evidence poverty worst influence determine whether nation total may still justifiably esteemed rich must set weigh number poor rich 
effect piece scale work course necessary determine first poor rich also poor rich 
prove curious thermometrical investigation shall gold silver done quicksilver determine namely freezing point zero temperate fever heat points finally vaporescent point riches sometimes explosively lately america make wings correspondently number degrees zero poverty ceasing brace wholesome cold burns bone 

performance operations strictest sense scientific first look existing called science political economy ask define us comparatively superlatively rich comparatively superlatively poor terms terms pronounce examine prosperous england many rich many poor people whether quantity intensity poverty indeed overbalanced quantity intensity wealth may permit luxurious blindness call complacently rich country 
find clear definition existing science endeavor fix true degrees scale apply 

question third 
quantity store relation currency seen real worth currency far dependent relation magnitude store may vary within certain limits without affecting worth exchange 
diminution increase represented wealth may unperceived currency may taken either less truly worth 
usually taken much power exchange credit power thus increased given strain upon relation existing wealth 
credit power chief importance thoughts sharply present experience mercantile community conditions stability relations currency material store entirely simple principle action 
far simple relations currency available labor also represents 
relation involved magnitude store number magnitude store mind population 
proportion number resulting worth currency calculable proportion labor 
worth piece money claims given quantity store exchange less greater according facility obtaining quantity thing without recourse store 
words depends immediate cost price thing 
must therefore complete definition terms 

cost price counted labour 
must know first therefore counted labour 
already defined labor contest life man opposite 
literally quantity lapse loss failure human life caused effort 
usually confused effort application power opera much effort merely mode recreation pleasure 
beautiful actions human body highest results human intelligence conditions achievements quite unlaborious nay recreative effort 
labor suffering effort 
negative quantity quantity de feat counted every feat de fect counted every fact deed men 
brief quantity toil die 
might therefore priori conjecture shall ultimately find bought sold 
everything else bought sold labour labor bought sold anything priceless 
idea commodity bought sold alpha omega politico economic fallacy 

nature labor cost anything quantity labor necessary obtain quantity stands constant 
literally constancy thing shall win move come less 
cost measured measurable using accurate latin terms labor opera 
matter much work thing needs produce matters much distress 
generally power requires less distress noblest works man cost less meanest 
true labor spending life either body fatigue pain temper heart perseverance search things patience waiting fortitude degradation suffering like intellect 
kinds labor supposed included general term quantity labor expressed time lasts 
unit labor hour work day work may determine 

cost like value intrinsic effectual 
intrinsic cost getting thing right way effectual cost getting thing way set 
intrinsic cost made subject analytical investigation partially discoverable long experience 
effectual cost political economist deal say cost thing existing circumstances known processes 
cost dependent much application method varies quantity thing wanted number persons work 
easy get little things difficult get much impossible get things hands easy get many 

cost value things however difficult determine accurately thus dependent ascertainable physical circumstances 
price dependent human 
thing demonstrably good much 
may demonstrably much 
remains questionable manner ways questionable whether choose give much 
choice always relative one 
choice give price rather resolution thing getting involve loss better thing 
price depends therefore cost commodity relation cost every attainable thing 
farther 
power choice also relative one 
depends merely estimate thing everybody else estimate therefore number force concurrent buyers existing quantity thing proportion number force 
hence price anything depends four variables 

cost 

attainable quantity cost 

number power persons want 

estimate formed desirableness 
value affects price far contemplated estimate perhaps therefore 

order show manner price expressed terms currency must assume four quantities known estimate desirableness commonly called demand certain 
take number persons lowest 
let b two labourers demand say resolved labor two articles b 
demand articles reader likes better may say need conceived absolute existence depending getting two things 
suppose instance bread fuel cold country let represent least quantity bread b least quantity fuel support man life day 
let producible hour labor b two hours labor 
cost one hour b two cost definition expressible terms time 
therefore man worked corn fuel would work three hours day 
divide labor greater ease 
works three hours produces one men want 
b works three hours produces b half b less want 
work three hours b six b b maintenance right proportion day half might take half day rest 
b worked double time whole day rest belongs equity 
therefore exchange giving two one b one one b maintenance day 
b giving one b two two two b maintenance two days 
b rest second day would left without article b produces 
means making exchange unless third labourer called 
one workman produces two b c produce b working three hours three b three hours b c three hours b 
b c give half b equal daily maintenance equal daily work 
carry example single step farther let three articles b c needed 
let need one hour work b two c four day work must seven hours one man day work make b c 
therefore one works producing two b work b producing b four c work c producing c 
six spare gives two one b four one c 
b b spare gives b one two b one c 
c c spare gives c one b c one 
day maintenance 
generally therefore follows demand constant relative prices things costs quantities labor involved production 

order express prices terms currency put currency form orders certain quantity given article us form orders gold quantities articles priced relation bear article currency claims 
worth currency slightest degree founded worth article either claims consists gold worth every article gold exchangeable 
accurate say many pounds worth acre land acre land worth many pounds 
worth gold land houses food things depends moment existing quantities relative demands change worth demand one involves instantaneously correspondent change worth demand rest change inevitable accurately balanced though often process untraceable change volume outflowing river vast lake caused change volume inflowing streams though eye trace instrument detect motion either surface depth 

thus real working power worth currency founded entire sum relative estimates formed population possessions change estimate direction therefore every change national character instantly alters value money second great function commanding labor 
must always carefully sternly distinguish worth currency dependent conceived appreciated value represents worth dependent existence represents 
currency true false proportion security gives claim possession land house horse picture currency strong weak worth much worth little proportion degree estimate nation holds house horse picture claimed 
thus power english currency till late largely based national estimate horses wine man might always give price furnish choicely stable cellar receive public approval therefor gave sum furnish library called mad biblio maniac

might difficult choose one 

observe sources variation power currency exist wholly irrespective influences vice indolence improvidence 
hitherto supposed throughout analysis every professing labourer labor honestly heartily harmony fellows 
bring farther calculation effects relative industry honor forethought thus follow bearings second inquiry holders store currency proportions however must reserve next paper noticing however distinct several branches subject radically interwoven issues rightly treat one till taken cognizance 
thus need currency proportion number population materially influenced probable number holders proportion non holders number holders goods wealth proportion non holders goods 
definition currency claim goods possessed quantity indicates number claimants proportion number holders force complexity claim 
claims complex currency means exchange may small quantity 
sells corn b receiving promise b pay cattle hands c get wine 
c due time claims cattle b b takes back promise 
exchanges might effected single coin promise proportion currency store would circumstances indicate circulating vitality say quantity convenient divisibility part store habits nation keep circulation 
cattle breeder content live household chiefly meat milk want rich furniture jewels books wine corn grower maintains men chiefly grapes bread wives daughters families weave spin clothing household nation whole remains content produce soil work hands little occasion circulating media 
pledges promises little seldom exchanges far exchange necessary life 
store belongs people whose hands found money little needed either expression right practical means division exchange 

proportion habits nation become complex fantastic may without therefore civilized circulating medium must increase proportion store 
every one wants little everything food must many kinds dress many fashions multitudes live work ministering fancy pay measured fancy large prices given one person valueless another great inequalities knowledge causing great inequalities estimate finally worst currency largeness power possession implies becomes sole object desire large numbers nation holding disputed among main object life cases currency necessarily enlarges proportion store means exchange division bond right object passion important malignant power nation dealings character life 
power bond right becomes conspicuous burdensome popular voice apt raised violent irrational manner leading revolution instead remedy 
whereas possibility economy depends clear assertion maintenance bond right however burdensome 
first necessity economical government secure unquestioned unquestionable working great law property man works thing shall allowed get keep consume peace eat cake day shall seen without grudging cake morrow 
say first point secured social law without political advance nay political existence sort possible

degrees transferableness variable documents passing certain places others passing less inscribed value mass speak fluidity currency variable 
true perfect currency flows freely like pure stream becomes sluggish stagnant proportion quantity less transferable matter mixes adding bulk diminishing purity 
articles commercial value bills drawn increase currency indefinitely substances intrinsic value stamped signed without restriction become acknowledgments debt increase indefinitely also 
every bit gold found australia long remains uncoined article offered sale like soon coined pounds diminishes value every pound pockets 

legally authorized national currency perfect condition form public acknowledgment debt regulated divided person presenting commodity tried worth public market shall please receive exchange document giving claim return equivalent place time kind 
currency quite healthy vital persons entrusted management always able give demand either assigning document assigned quantity goods 
b assigned quantity goods assigning document 
give document goods national exchange fault

nature power document therefore examined three relations bears place time kind 


gives claim return equivalent wealth place 
use function save carriage parting bushel corn london may receive order bushel corn antipodes elsewhere 
perfect use substance currency must maximum portable credible intelligible 
non acceptance discredit results always form ignorance dishonor far interruptions rise differences denomination ground continuance among civilized nations 
may convenient one country use chiefly copper coinage another silver another gold reckoning accordingly centimes francs zecchins franc different weight value shilling zwanziger vary wanton loss commercial power 


gives claim return equivalent wealth time 
second use currency exponent accumulation renders laying store command individuals unlimitedly possible whereas intervention gathering would confined within certain limits bulk property decay difficulty guardianship 
pull barns build greater daily saying material investment enlargement care 
national currency transfers guardianship store many preserves original producer right entering possession future period 


gives claim practical though legal return equivalent wealth kind 
transferable right merely anything power function proportioned range choice 
give child apple toy give determinate pleasure give penny indeterminate one proportioned range selection offered shops village 
power world currency similarly proportion openness world fair commonly enhanced brilliancy external aspect rather solidity wares 

said currency consists orders equivalent goods 
equivalent quality must guaranteed 
kinds goods chosen specific claim must therefore capable test also store may kept hand meet call currency smallness bulk great relative value desirable indestructibility least certain period essential 
indestructibility facility tested united gold intrinsic value great imaginary value greater partly indolence partly necessity want organization nations agreed take gold basis currencies grave disadvantage portability enabling metal become active part medium exchange stream currency becomes opaque gold half currency half commodity unison functions partly neutralize partly enhance force 

partly neutralize since far gold commodity bad currency liable sale far currency bad commodity exchange value interferes practical use 
especially employment higher branches arts becomes unsafe account liability melted exchange 

partly enhance since far gold acknowledged intrinsic value good currency everywhere acceptable far legal exchangeable value worth commodity increased 
want gold form dust crystal seek coined form pay baker butcher 
worth exchange absorbs large quantity use greatly increases effect imagination quantity used arts 
thus brief force functions increased precision blunted unison 

inconveniences however attach gold basis currency account portability preciousness 
far greater inconvenience attaches legal basis currency 
imagine gold attainable masses weighing several pounds value like malachite marble proportioned largeness bulk could get confused currency daily use might still remain basis second inconvenience would still affect namely significance expression debt varies every article would popular estimate desirableness quantity offered market 
power obtaining goods gold depends always strength public passion gold limitation quantity either two things happen world esteems gold less finds easily right claim degree effaced even gravely maintained discovery mountain gold would cancel national debt words men may paid costs much costs nothing 
true little chance sudden convulsion respect world rapidly increase wisdom despise gold sudden perhaps may little time desire eagerly easily obtained nevertheless right debt ought rest basis imagination frame national currency vibrate every miser panic every merchant imprudence 

two methods avoiding insecurity would fallen upon long ago instead calculating conditions supply gold men considered world might live manage affairs without gold 
one base currency substances truer intrinsic value base several substances instead one 
claim gold discovery golden mountain starves claim bread discovery continent corn fields need trouble 
however wish exchange bread things good harvest time limit power respect claim either bread iron silk pleasure standard value three feet instead one proportionately firm 
thus ultimately steadiness currency depends upon breadth base difficulty organization increasing breadth discovery condition safest convenient long analysis must present deferred 
gold silver may always retained limited use luxury coinage questionless standard one weight alloy among nations varying die 
purity coinage metallic closely indicative honesty system revenue even general dignity state 

whatever article articles may national currency promises pay premium article indicates bankruptcy government proportion division assets restrained remaining confidence holders notes return prosperity firm 
currencies forced acceptance unlimited issue merely various modes disguising taxation delaying pressure late interfere cause pressure 
away possibility disguise would among first results true economical science existed many motives concealment long could artifices maintained permit hitherto even founding science 

indeed evil conduct wilfully persisted embarrassment either theory working currency 
exchequer ever embarrassed financial question difficult solution people keep practice honest heads cool 
governments lose office pilotage protection scrutiny live magnificence authorized larceny polished mendacity people choosing speculation usually redundant spelling instead toil visit dishonesty chastisement may impunity take dishonest turn tricks financial terminology save signature mintage magnify ruin retard even riches remain stagnant current change slime avernus sand phlegethon quick sand embouchure land fluently recommended recent auctioneers eligible building leases 

finally power true currency fourfold 

credit power 
worth exchange dependent public opinion stability honesty issuer 

real worth 
supposing gold whatever else currency expressly promises required issuer notes call met full 
actual worth document would actual worth moment therefore defined division assets issuer would produce 

exchange power base 
granting get five pounds gold note remains question much things get five pounds gold 
things exist less gold greater power 

power labor exercised given quantity base things got 
question case much work question questions whose work food five pounds buy 
depends number population gifts dispositions slightest humors strongest impulses power currency varies 

main conditions national currency proceed examine total currency broad definition transferable acknowledgment debt among many forms effect two distinctly opposed namely acknowledgments debts paid debts 
documents whether whole part bad debt good debt bad money bullion put present forms imposture aside analyzing metal wash clear dross range exact quantities true currency country one side store property country 
place gold substances side documents far operate signature side store far operate value 
currency represents quantity debt country store quantity possession 
ownership property divided holders currency holders store whatever claiming value currency moment value deducted riches store holders 

farther true currency represents definition debts paid represents either debtor wealth ability willingness say either wealth existing hands transferred creditor wealth time surely return either increasing diminishing strength reproduce 
sound currency therefore increase represents enlarging debt represents also enlarging means curious way certain quantity marks deficiency wealth country would currency existed 
respect like detritus mountain assume lies fixed angle detritus larger must mountain would larger still none 

farther though stated every man possessing money usually also property beyond necessary immediate wants men possessing property usually also hold currency beyond necessary immediate exchanges mainly determines class belong whether eyes money adjunct property property money 
first case holder pleasure possessions money subordinately means bettering adding 
second pleasure money possessions representing 
first case money atmosphere surrounding wealth rising raining back upon second deluge wealth floating part perishing 
shortest distinction men one wishes always buy sell 

great relations classes several characters highest importance nation character store holders chiefly depend preservation display serviceableness wealth currency holders distribution reproduction 
shall therefore ultimately find incomparably greater importance nation whose hands thing put much got character holders may conjectured quality store man always asks thing asks bettered betters possession possessor reciprocally act entire sum national possession 
base nation asking base things sinks daily deeper vileness nature weakness use noble nation asking noble things rises daily diviner eminence tendency degradation surely marked greek ataxia say expanding greek thought carelessness hands things put consequent dispute acquisition disorderliness accumulation inaccuracy estimate bluntness conception entire nature possession 

currency holders always increase number influence proportion bluntness nature clumsiness store holders less use people make things want sooner weary want change something else frequency change increases quantity power currency 
large currency holder essentially person never able make mind proceeds therefore vague collection aggregation infuriate passion urged complacency progress vacancy idea pride conquest 
however obscurity nature possession currency charm seclusion people enticing 
enjoyment real property others must partly share 
groom enjoyment stud gardener garden money seems shut wholly enviable 
one else part complacencies arising 
power arithmetical comparison also great thing unimaginative people 
know always much better money much better others money wit compared character 
neighbor convinced wiser worth much universality conviction less flattering clearness 
understand none measure willingly adore superiorities things everybody understand money everybody count worship 

various temptations accumulation would politically harmless vainly accumulated fair chance wisely spent 
accumulation go ever must day end reverse reverse indeed beneficial distribution use irrigation reservoir fever gathering though perilous gatherer might serviceable community 
constantly happens constantly may stated political law exceptions unreasonably gathered also unreasonably spent persons whose hands finally falls 
frequently spent war else stupefying luxury twice hurtful indulged rich witnessed poor

commerce 

currency conveys right choice many things exchange one commerce agency power choice obtained countries producing timber obtain timber silk gold naturally producing jewels frankincense obtain cattle corn 
function commerce importance country proportion limitations products restlessness fancy generally greater importance towards northern latitudes 

commerce necessary however exchange local products local skill 
labour requiring agency fire given abundantly cold countries labor requiring suppleness body sensitiveness touch warm ones labor involving accurate vivacity thought temperate ones peculiar imaginative actions produced extremes heat cold light darkness 
production great art limited climates warm enough admit repose open air cool enough render repose delightful 
minor variations modes skill distinguish every locality 
labor place easiest place cheapest becomes often desirable products raised one country wrought another 
hence arisen discussions international values one day remembered highly curious exercises human mind 
discovered due course tide time international value regulated inter provincial inter parishional value 
coals hops exchanged northumberland kent absolutely principles iron wine lancashire spain

distances nations measured seas ignorances divisions determined dialects enmities 

course system international values may always constructed assume relation moral law physical geography instance right cheat rob across river though across road across sea though across river c system values may constructed assuming similar relations taxation physical geography instance article taxed crossing river crossing road carried fifty miles carried five c positions indeed easily maintained put logical form one law international value maintainable form namely farther neighbor lives less understands bound true dealings power greater proportion ignorance remedy difficult proportion distance 

said breadth sea increases cost exchange 
note exchange commerce always costly sum value goods diminished cost conveyance maintenance persons employed advantage producers getting one thing greater loss conveyance exchange expedient 
justly conducted porters kept producers commonly called merchants expect mere pay profit 
commerce three parties two persons societies exchanging agent agents exchange value things exchanged known exchangers receives equal value neither gaining losing whatever one gains loses 
intermediate agent paid known per centage partly labor conveyance partly care knowledge risk every attempt concealment amount pay indicates either effort part agent obtain unjust profit effort part exchangers refuse pay 
part first namely effort part merchant obtain larger profit called buying cheap selling dear 
part indeed larger gain deserved might openly demanded reward merchant knowledge foresight probable necessity greater part gain unjust unjust fatal way depends first keeping exchangers ignorant exchange value articles secondly taking advantage buyer need seller poverty 
therefore one essential quite fatal forms usury usury means merely taking exorbitant sum use anything matter whether exorbitance loan exchange rent price essence usury obtained advantage opportunity necessity due reward labor 
great thinkers therefore held unnatural impious far feeds distress others folly 
nevertheless attempts repress law must ever ineffective though plato bacon first napoleon three men knew somewhat humanity british merchant usually tried hands left probably good moderative forms law examine place

customs manners sensitive highly trained race always vital say orderly manifestations intense life like habitual action fingers musician 
customs manners vile rude race contrary conditions decay properly speaking habits incrustations restraints forms life gangrenes noisome beginnings death 
generally far custom attaches indolence instead action prejudice instead perception takes deadly character thus custom hangs upon us weight heavy frost deep almost life

high ethical training nation implies perfect grace pitifulness peace irreconcilably inconsistent filthy mechanical employments desire money mental states anxiety jealousy indifference pain

many points conduct respecting nation may wisely express written precept resolve yet enforce penalty expedient degree penalty always quite separate consideration expedience statute statute may often better enforced mercy severity also easier bearing less likely abrogated 
farther laws precept reference especially youth concern training laws judgment manhood concern remedy reward 
highly curious feeling english mind educational law think man liberty interfered till done irrevocable wrong whereas late gracious kingly interference hinder 
make educational laws strict criminal ones may gentle leave youth liberty dig dungeons age 
good man wear yoke youth reins may silken thread sweet chime silver bells bridle captivity age must forge iron fetter cast passing bell

every article human wealth certain conditions attached merited possession unobserved possession becomes rapine 
object meristic law secure every man rightful share share worked produced received gift rightful owner enforce due conditions possession far law may conveniently reach instance land shall wantonly allowed run waste streams shall poisoned persons whose properties pass air rendered unwholesome beyond given limits 
laws kind exist already rudimentary degree need large development laws respecting possession works art hitherto much conceived daily loss national wealth use respect quite incalculable

cost crime endured nations ignorantly expense nowhere stated budgets cost judgment patiently provided pure money science perhaps ought rather say art law felt found noble profession discipline civilized nations usually glad number persons supported exercise oratory analysis 
yet calculated practical value might directions intelligence occupied deciding courses years might decided justly date judgment fixed many hours 
imagine one half funds great nation devotes dispute law applied determination physical questions medicine agriculture theoretic science calculate probable results within next ten years say nothing yet deadly lamentable loss involved use purchased instead personal justice greek epakt par n aporia oikei n 
order true analysis critic law must understand real meaning word injury 
commonly understand kind harm done one man another define idea harm sometimes limit harm sufferer conscious whereas much worst injuries unconscious times limit idea violence restraint whereas much worse forms injury accomplished indolence withdrawal restraint 

injury simply refusal violation man right claim upon fellows claim much talked modern times term right mainly resolvable two branches man claim hindered claim hindered two forms hindrance intensified reward help fortune fors one side punishment impediment even final arrest mors 

order man obtaining two rights clearly needful worth approximately known well want worth unhappily usually principal subject study critic law careful hitherto mark degrees de merit instead merit assigning indeed de ficiencies always alas even estimate fine penalty ef ficiencies side much interesting well profitable part subject assigning neither estimate aid

visible government nominally carries national business determines foreign relations raises taxes levies soldiers orders war peace otherwise becomes arbiter national fortune

instance every traveller least every traveller thirty years standing must love calais place first felt strange world 
turner evidently loved excessively 
never catalogued studies calais remember moment five first pas de calais large oil painting saw broad daylight crossed got near french side 
careful study french fishing boats running shore wind picturesque old city distance 
calais harbor liber studiorum saw going harbor heavy brig warping likely get way run pier bad weather coming 
calais pier large painting engraved years ago mr lupton saw landed ran back directly pier see become brig 
weather got still worse fishwomen blown distressful manner pier head fishing boats running speed 
fortrouge calais saw home dessein dined went evening walk sands tide 
never seen waste sands made impression 
shrimp girls scattered moved white spots wild shore storm lulled little sunset sunset bars fortrouge seen skeleton wise 
paint directly thought painted long afterwards 
vignette illustrations scott 
saw going home meditatively revolving lighthouse came blazing upon suddenly disturbed 
like much made vignette however asked bit calais twenty thirty years afterwards already done rest 
turner never told one may see compare pictures 
might possibly impressions single day two days three though human probability seen stated records successive impressions plainly written ever traveller diary 
pure veracities 
therefore immortal 
could multiply series almost indefinitely rest works 
curious kind private mark running subjects 
thus know three drawings scarborough starfish foreground remember others marine subjects starfish
