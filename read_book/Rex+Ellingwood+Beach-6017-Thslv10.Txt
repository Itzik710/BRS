urgent george balt became desperate indians like white men proved sad trial big fellow accustomed drive crews cruelty convict foreman 
despite utmost endeavors could keep plant running capacity zeal took blame wholly upon 
daily output disappointing emerson drew consolation prospect pack would large enough least avert utter ruin argued first season power marsh could bring bear would serve crush

otherwise marsh would simply cut rival catch lowest point broken market fall 
trust tremendous resources back could afforded hammer price fish point emerson would either ruined forced carry pack year course would upheld wayne wayland

therefore necessary work young man undoing
