new pharaoh man dreams ana 
late years sleep light sometimes dream though magic like ki 
dream dreamed great multitude marching like locusts egypt 
went column fire two hands 
one held amon throat one held new pharaoh throat 
came column cloud shape like unwrapped mummy shape death standing upon water full countless dead 
bethought picture prince seen skies yonder land goshen said nothing 
yet think bakenkhonsu saw mind asked never dream friend see visions come true amenmeses throne instance 
also dream times well prince look like men might time ripe pregnant 
oh remember

oh live long would bathe child used bathe nile following day appointed hour went great hall palace first seen meneptah took stand place allotted 
somewhat far back perhaps wished known private scribe seti remind egypt appearing could see 
great hall crowd filled furthest corners 
moreover common man present rather every noble head priest egypt wives daughters dim courts shone gold precious gems set upon festal garments 
waiting old bakenkhonsu hobbled towards crowd making way could see laughter sunken eyes 
ill placed ana said 
still many gods egypt chance rain fires pharaoh shall safer 
talking gods went whisper heard happened hour ago temple ptah tanis whence come pharaoh blood royal save one walked according custom statue god know bow head show chooses accepts king 
front amenmeses went princess userti passed head god bowed saw though pretended see 
came pharaoh stood waiting would bow though priests called old formula god greets king 
length went looking black night others blood rameses followed order 
last limped saptah behold god bowed 
things asked wrong time ask priests ana userti saptah 
perhaps divine neck oiled late much oiled little oiled prayers strings may gone wrong 
pharaoh may niggard gifts college great god house 
know ways gods temple served thebes fifty years ago pretend bow trouble royal race sat upon throne 
hush comes pharaoh 
splendid procession surrounded princes councillors ladies priests guards amenmeses royal wife urnure large woman walked awkwardly entered hall glittering band 
high priest roi chancellor nehesi received pharaoh led throne 
multitude prostrated trumpets blew thrice old salute life blood strength pharaoh pharaoh pharaoh cried aloud 
amenmeses rose bowed saw heavy face troubled looked older 
swore oath gods men roi dictated company put double crown emblems took hands scourge golden sickle 
next homage paid 
princess userti came first kissed pharaoh hand bent knee 
indeed first spoke 
could hear said afterwards learned demanded publicly repeat promises father meneptah made confirming place rights 
end though seemed unwillingly enough 
many forms ancient celebrations ceremony went till grew weary waiting time pharaoh make speech people 
speech however never made presently thrusting past us saw two prophets israelites visited meneptah hall 
men shrank walked straight throne even guards strive bar way 
said could hear believe demanded people allowed go worship god fashion amenmeses refused meneptah done 
one cast rod turned snake hissed pharaoh whereon kherheb ki company also cast rods turned snakes though could hear hissing 
great gloom fell upon hall men could see faces everyone began call aloud till company broke confusion 
bakenkhonsu borne together doorway pressure people whence glad enough see sky 
thus ended crowning amenmeses 
chapter xii message jabez night none rejoiced streets city save palace houses court none feasted 
walked abroad market place noted people going fro gloomily talking together whispers 
presently man whose face hidden hood began speak saying message master prince seti 
answered took messages veiled strangers whereon threw back hood saw jabez uncle merapi 
asked whether obeyed prince borne body prophet back goshen told elders manner man death 
yes answered elders angry prince matter 
said messenger exceeded authority since never told curse merapi much less attempt kill prince right slay one would done murder royal eyes 
still added curse spoken priest would surely fall upon merapi way 
jabez know scribe 
returns people perchance absolved must surely marry laban 
judge 
would place jabez think stay make dear seti taking chance curse may pass since lawfully decreed upon 
whichever way looks trouble waits worst woman might wish satisfy heart falls especially heart happen turn one pharaoh 
say pharaoh jabez asked standing empty place alone

put prayer people hebrews suffered go worship wilderness pharaoh refused 
went sail upon river early morning another day met one struck water rod turned blood 
whereon ki kherheb company also struck water rods turned blood 
six days ago officer swore blood creeping nile tale laughed

first break day gave order start 
looking side barge seemed though lights dawn fallen sky nile whereof water become pink hued 
moreover hue grew ever deeper traveling stream course nature could therefore caused red soil washed southern lands 
bargemen stared muttered together

much afraid indeed forced hold course would turned rowed stream beached boat fled desert 
cried steer northwards thus perhaps sooner done horror obeyed 
ever went hue water grew red almost blackness till last seemed though traveling sea gore dead fish floated thousand struggled dying surface 
also stench dreadful must bind linen nostrils strain foetid air 
came abreast town streets one great wail terror rose heaven 
men stood staring though drunken looking red arms dipped stream women ran fro upon bank tearing hair robes crying words wizard work bewitched accursed gods slain men must die forth 
also saw peasants digging holes distance shore see perchance might come water sweet wholesome 
day long traveled thus horrible flood spray driven strong north wind spotted flesh garments till like butchers reeking shambles 
could eat food stench spray made taste salt fresh blood drank water provided rowers held mad named wisest men one knew would befall future 
length towards evening noted water growing much less red every hour passed another marvel seeing us upstream color jasper whereon paused rowing defiled sang hymn gave thanks hapi god nile great secret hidden 
sunset indeed river clean save bank made fast night stones rushes stained dead fish lay thousands polluting air 
escape stench climbed cliff rose quite close nile saw mouths ancient tombs long ago robbed left empty purposing sleep one 
path worn feet men ran largest tombs whence drew near heard sound wailing 
looking saw woman children crouched upon floor tomb heads covered dust perceived us cried loudly though harsh dry voices thinking doubt robbers perhaps ghosts bloodstained garments 
also another child little one cry dead
