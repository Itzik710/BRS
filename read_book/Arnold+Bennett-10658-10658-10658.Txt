iii mr skellorn come definitely late 
window bedroom front house hilda looked westwards toward slopes chatterley wood child used go children pick sparse bluebells thrived smoke 
bailiwick turnhill lay behind murky district five towns turnhill northern outpost lay south 
foot chatterley wood canal wound large curves way towards undefiled plains cheshire sea 
canal side exactly opposite hilda window flour mill sometimes made nearly much smoke kilns chimneys closing prospect either hand 
flour mill bricked path separated considerable row new cottages appurtenant gardens led straight lessways street front mrs lessways house 
path mr skellorn arrived inhabited farthest cottages 
hilda held mr skellorn disdain held row cottages disdain 
seemed mr skellorn cottages mysteriously resembled primness smugness detestable self complacency 
yet cottages perhaps thirty stood great deal hilda glancing shattered scorn 
row called freehold villas consciously proud name district much land copyhold could change owners subject payment fines feudal consent court presided agent lord manor 
dwellings owned occupiers absolute monarch soil niggled sooty garden evening amid flutter drying shirts towels 
freehold villas symbolized final triumph victorian economics apotheosis prudent industrious artisan 
corresponded building society secretary dream paradise 
indeed real achievement 
nevertheless hilda irrational contempt would admit 
saw freehold villas nothing narrowness long narrow strips gardens narrow homes flattened together uniformity brickiness polished brassiness righteousness eternal laundry 
upper floor home gazed destructively upon chill crimson eye descending sun 
home ideal better 
one two middle houses detached terrace four houses built grandfather lessways teapot manufacturer chief four obviously habitation proprietor terrace 
one corner houses comprised grocer shop house robbed proportion garden seigneurial garden plot might triflingly larger others 
terrace terrace cottages houses rated twenty six thirty six pounds year beyond means artisans petty insurance agents rent collectors 
well built generously built architecture though debased showed faint traces georgian amenity 
admittedly best row houses newly settled quarter town 
coming freehold villas mr skellorn obviously came something superior wider liberal 
suddenly hilda heard mother voice rather startled conversational tone another woman speaking voices died away 
mrs lessways evidently opened back door somebody taken sitting room 
occurrence unusual 
hilda went softly landing listened could catch nothing faint irregular murmur 
scarcely stationed landing mother burst sitting room called loudly hilda instant impatiently excitedly long hilda could possibly appeared response bedroom mother supposed hilda hilda could see without seen

uncontrolled face shamelessly expressive one thinks unwatched 
hilda moved silently descend demanded low tone whose harsh self possession reproof volatile creature mother matter mrs lessways gave surprised oh like flash features changed attempt appear calm collected 
coming downstairs said hilda 
always trying pretend nobody least thing happens way runs world like child 
mrs lessways offered reply simply stood foot stairs asked well said mother lamentably

hsh hsh mrs lessways protested indicating open door sitting room 
know mrs grant seems mr skellorn paralytic stroke 
terrible hilda continued smoothly descend stairs followed mother sitting room 
chapter ii end scene linen money bag account book proper last wednesday month lay green damask cloth round table hilda mother took meals 
paralytic stroke drastic enough mar mr skellorn precious reputation probity reliability 
statement receipts expenditure together corresponding cash due two clock despite paralytic stroke less quarter hour late 
one side bag book ranged older women mrs lessways thin vivacious mrs grant large solemn side opposition young dark slim girl rather wiry black hair straight prominent eyebrows extraordinary expression uncompromising aloofness 
enjoying said hilda mrs grant 
fact mrs grant quite unconsciously appear savoring catastrophe pleasure 
although paralytic strokes prevalent period constituted even striking dramatic event 
moreover considered direct visitations god 
also something mysteriously agreeably impressive word paralytic people would repeat pleasure repeating 
mrs grant whose mighty breast flowed black mantle suited occasion used word narrated afresh hilda history stroke 
yes said came fetched bed three clock morning would believe though hardly speak money book waiting desk would come sixty seven always like 
believe paralysed sides instead right side speechless ha made understand must come two clock 
bit late kept home son enoch got whitlow worrying life enoch 
mrs lessways warmly deprecated apology inexactitude wiped sympathetic eyes 
father mrs grant resumed 
doctor hinted quiet like never leave bed 
laid rest days warned warnings 
mrs grant contemplated solemn gleeful satisfaction overwhelming grandeur disaster happened father 
active old man continual figure streets cut moment world condemned life mattress 
sincerely imagined filled proper grief aesthetic appreciation theatrical effectiveness misfortune certainly stronger feeling 
observing mrs lessways wept also drew handkerchief 
wishful count money said mrs grant

mrs grant crossed road taken bricked path leading paralytic house mrs lessways slowly shut door bolted said hilda well girl think might tried show little feeling close together narrow lobby heavy pulse clock ticking 
hilda replied surely serious collecting rents mother serious course serious said mrs lessways 
ii collect rents asked mrs lessways 
half defiant question put two hours later 
meantime remark made rents 
mother daughter tea sitting room 
hilda passed greater part two hours upstairs bedroom pondering mother preposterous notion collecting rents 
alone would invent conversations mother silencing foolish woman unanswerable sarcastic phrases utterly destroyed illogical arguments 
would repeat phrases repeat even entire conversations pleasure dwelling also pleasure upon grievances mother would gradually arrive state dull glowing resentment 
could chose easily free brain obsession either reading sharp jerk volition often preferred saying voluptuously nurse grievance nurse nurse nurse mine anybody sense would admit instantly absolutely right 
thus afternoon 
came tea face formidably expressive would attempt modify rancor uncompromising features 
contrary soon saw mother noticed condition deliberately intensified 
mrs lessways incapable sustained thought completely forgotten recalled subject cottage rents several times since departure mrs grant nevertheless diagnosed cause trouble usual precipitancy began repulse attack even opened 
mrs lessways good strategy especially conflicts daughter 
ingenuous hasty thing much candidly human

brief rare efforts play mother ludicrous 
simply honest acquire stature standing maternal dignity 
profound instinct wistfully treated everybody equal fellow creature even daughter 
way come credit threatened altercation rent collecting 
hilda offered reply mrs lessways said reproachfully hilda bad sometimes silence anyhow quite decided

somehow enjoyed experience 
tighten lips became oblivious clumsiness cruelty savoring pleasure pain situation clasping thought mr skellorn tragedy shot brain tenderness pity welled somewhere within mingled exquisitely dark melancholy 
found delight reading poor mother like open book supposed

candid peacemaking never occurred 
mrs lessways simple forgiveness wrath disguise pleasure remarkable fact hilda made overture 
hilda thought strange coming glanced range pale gleam red gleam heavy twilight seemed inexpressibly enchantingly mournful 
mournful future mournful
