palaces nobles see receptacles immortal canvas italian imperishable sculpture grecian art still day retained massive walls barred windows spacious courts time protected rude retainers 
high gates rose lofty solid tower whose height commanded wide view mutilated remains rome gate adorned strengthened either side columns granite whose doric capitals betrayed sacrilege torn one many temples formerly crowded sacred forum 
spoils came vast fragments travertine made walls outer court 
common day barbarous appropriations precious monuments art columns domes earlier rome regarded classes quarries every man free gather materials whether castle cottage wantonness outrage far greater goths later age would fain attributed disgrace perhaps even heavier offences excited classical indignation petrarch made sympathise rienzi hopes rome 
still may see churches even earlier dates shapeless architecture built sites marbles consecrating rather consecrated names venus jupiter minerva 
palace prince orsini duke gravina yet reared graceful arches still visible theater marcellus fortress savelli 
adrian passed court heavy waggon blocked way laden huge marbles dug unexhausted mine golden house nero intended additional tower stephen colonna proposed yet strengthen tasteless barbarous edifice old noble maintained dignity outraging law 
friend petrarch pupil rienzi sighed deeply passed vehicle new spoliations pillar fluted alabaster rolling carelessly waggon fell loud crash upon pavement 
foot stairs grouped dozen bandits old colonna entertained playing dice upon ancient tomb clear deep inscription different slovenly character later empire bespoke memorial powerful age rome empty even ashes upset served table foreign savages strewn even early hour fragments meat flasks wine 
scarcely stirred scarcely looked young noble passed fierce oaths loud ejaculations uttered northern patois grated harsh upon ear mounted slow step lofty unclean stairs 
came vast ante chamber half filled higher class patrician retainers five six pages chosen inferior noblesse congregated narrow deep sunk casement discussing grave matters gallantry intrigue three petty chieftains band corselets donned swords casques beside sitting stolid silent table middle room might taken automatons save solemn regularity ever anon lifted moustachioed lips several goblets complacent grunt settled contemplations 
striking contrast northern phlegm presented crowd italian clients petitioners parasites walked restlessly fro talking loudly vehement gestures varying physiognomy southern vivacity 
general stir sensation adrian broke upon miscellaneous company 
bandit captains nodded heads mechanically pages bowed admired fashion plume hose clients petitioners parasites crowded round separate request interest potent kinsman

two faults however marred effect sagacity supreme insolence disposition profound belief lights experience 
incapable analogy

face handsome almost extreme womanish delicacy 
fair hair waved long freely white unwrinkled forehead life camp suns italy little embrowned clear healthful complexion retained much bloom youth 
features aquiline regular eyes light hazel large bright penetrating short curled beard moustachio trimmed soldier like precision little darker hair gave indeed martial expression comely countenance rather expression might suited hero courts tournaments chief brigand camp

form happily contrasted elevated character countenance required strength stature free uncommon beauty charge effeminacy great height remarkable muscular power without least approach clumsy unwieldy bulk erred indeed rather side leanness flesh robust slender 
chief personal distinction warrior redoubted lance italy air carriage chivalric heroic grace greatly set time splendid dress brown velvet sown pearls hung surcoat worn knights hospital whereon wrought white eight pointed cross made badge order 
knight attitude earnest conversation bending slightly forward towards colonna resting hands according usual distinction old norman race small hands feet however disproportioned rest person time deemed less distinction well born refined age
