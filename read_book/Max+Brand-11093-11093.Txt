silent persuasion money however nash trusted many things 
roan jogged sullenly ahead giving strength gallant ugly body work piebald mustang pranced like dancing master beside behind continual jingling tossed bridle 
masters degree like horses rode nash kept steadily leaning front bulldog jaw thrusting bard forever shifting saddle settling hat humming tune whistling talking piebald asking idle questions things passed like boy starting vacation 
reached old house nash spoken mere shapeless black heap huddling night 
shed rear tied horses unsaddled 
single room shanty afterward nash lighted candle produced pack placed center floor unrolled blankets two bunks built wall either side narrow apartment 
truly crazy shack building two men materials hand might put together single day 
hardly based foundation rather set slope side hill accordingly settled lower side toward door

westerner rope different thing 
much useful material weapon 
italian fighting man man would choose knife westerner would take preference harmless piece rope 
hands takes life gains strange sinister quality 
one instant lies passive slowly whirled careless circle next noose darts like head striking cobra coil falls fastens draws tighter tighter remorselessly boa constrictor paralyzing life 
something went mind bard lay watching limp noose cowboy lariat nodded smiling 
suppose seems odd habit men sympathize 
fact 
whenever wilds carry gun like head sleep

said best yarn heard good many days enough make one sleepy goes 
turned deliberately side 
nash eyes staring incredulity sat slowly among blankets hand stole toward noose lariat 
light snore reached hardly snore much heavy intake breath weary sleeping man yet hand nash froze lariat 
god whispered faintly asleep candle flared wildly leaped shook 
chapter xxi swimming saverack face nash darkness passed like cold hand colder sense failure touched heart men ridden range one great power surpassing others power patience 
soundlessly pushed moment slipped blankets resigned sleep 
knew would wake first hint gray light trusted long ride day companion would still fast asleep 
half light would enough work roused room still scarcely visible filled gray fog found bard already pulling boots 
sleep growled following example tenderfoot 
well said cheerily 
see story vivid mind stayed awake night guess thinking

awake time 
still thrown noose lariat settled head shoulders sham sleeper would made difference whether waked slept end would sat william drew tied hand foot 
noose settled picture little piece paper fluttering floor came back strange vividness mind nash shrug shoulders shake thought away 
saddle moments awoke started breakfastless 
rain long ago ceased solemn silence brown hills around silence faint crinkling sound thirsty soil still drank 
heavy fall rain could see whenever passed bare spot grass grew crossed thick tracery rivulets washed slopes night 
soon reached little creek whose current barely knee deep foamed around shoulders horses set staggering 
saverack hell said nash better cut straight ford 
long take add three hours trip 
remember little date back eldara night 
look make mind said nash drily topped hill saw mighty yellow flood pouring valley

eight miles repeated ruefully 
far

still never turning back cowpuncher uncoiling lariat preparing cast bard edged piebald current 
felt mustang stagger water came knee deep checked horse casting eye shore shore summing chances 
simply water contend would hesitated along course sharp pointed rocks broad backed boulders loomed mighty splashing crashing one overbalanced force current rolled another step toward far sea 
rush water would carry far downstream chances hardly even would strike one murderous obstructions current foamed 
impulse made turn wave hand nash 
shouted give luck luck roared cowboy voice came faint distance thunder stream 
touched piebald spurs gallant little horse floundered forward lost footing struck water beyond depth 
instant bard swung clear saddle let body trail behind holding left hand tail struggling horse kicking aid progress 
immersed chin sometimes covered violent wave sound river grew strangely dim felt force current tugging like thousand invisible hands 
began wish taken boots entering weighted feet made leg weary kick 
nevertheless trusted brave heart mustang 
wavering wild horse 
head showed water ears pricking straight high never swerved back toward nearer shore 
progress first good neared central portion water swept many yards downstream one made transverse direction 
twice missed projecting rocks narrowest margin something like exceedingly thin exceedingly strong arm caught anthony around shoulders 
tugged back stopped forward progress let sweep rapidly stream back toward shore 
turning head caught glimpse nash sitting calmly saddle holding rope hands laughing 
next instant saw current placed taller rock bank 
rock line lariat caught hooking swimmers sharply toward bank 
would cut rope would almost impossible get knife open blade teeth still clinging tail swimming horse one hand 
reached water pulled colt effort swung 
close hand could reach rope therefore fired directly rope edge rock around lariat bent sharp angle 
splash bullet strong face rock sliced rope like knife 
snapped free brave little mustang straightened far shore 
instant bard swam revolver poised water caught glimpse nash restored difficulty holster gave attention strength helping horse water swimming one hand kicking vigorously feet 
perhaps would made exhaustion ears mustang drooping back 
shouted faint sound cheer piebald pricked single weary ear 
shouted time encouragement exultation swerving current caught bearing swiftly toward desired bank 
failed almost touching bottom swung sharply toward center mustang though realized last chance fought furiously 
anthony gave rest strength edged inch inch horse man staggered bank stood trembling fatigue 
glancing back saw nash act throwing lariat ground wild anger could understand meaning burst temper mere spoiled lariat gun whipped side cowboy exploded little piebald ears pricked sharply forward though vague curiosity crumpled ground 
suddenness took power action bard instant 
stood staring stupidly dying horse whirled gun hand frantic anger grief
