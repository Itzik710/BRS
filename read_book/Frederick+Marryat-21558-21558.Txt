two miles property right 
mansion reduced ashes hidden forest could feel position 
sighed time king cause triumphant arrival age could person support uphold cause 
longed command father lead men victory recover property revenge acted cruelly towards 
human nature much jacob armitage would expostulate try divert feelings channels long would preach forgiveness injuries patience better times come edward could help brooding thoughts ever breast animated intense hatred puritans edward beverley 
although lamented could create surprise wonder old forester 
could much possible reason soothe irritated feelings constant employment try make forget time feelings ill conceived 
one thing however sufficiently plain edward whatever might wrongs power present redress feeling perhaps held sort check time might opportunity appeared far distant even sanguine imagination degrees contrive dismiss thoughts use think present

old jacob less confined cottage rheumatism edward hunted either occasionally humphrey 
humphrey fortunate enough take bull cow calf pit fall year fifteen months old rude invention way windlass contrived assistance edward hoist uninjured pit 
put yard starved till tamed followed example heifer calf became quite tame 
important addition stock may well imagined 
mishap labored old jacob confinement cottage winter advanced prevented going lymington could therefore sell venison humphrey way experiment smoked venison hams hung others 
another point felt anxiety jacob could cross forest get puppies promised time past january called 
edward humphrey pressed old man hard let one go answer could obtain better soon 
last finding got worse instead better consented edward go 
gave directions proceed way take description keeper lodge cautioned call name armitage describe grandson 
edward promised obey jacob directions next morning set mounted upon white billy little money pocket case want 
wish going said humphrey walked side pony 
wish humphrey part feel slave set liberty 
justice old jacob kindness good acknowledge much indebted still housed forest never seeing speaking one shut world suit edward beverley 
father soldier right good one old enough think even escape join royal party broken may accounts moment 
deer stalking well fly higher game 
feel replied humphrey recollect edward old man infirm would become sisters leave know well humphrey idea leaving may sure wish relations safety free act 
yes edward recollect yet men boys fifteen thirteen much although may wish much 
true fifteen replied edward strong enough 
think fair cut man head would make stagger big buffalo 
young wars know well recollect father promising go soon fifteen 
puzzles replied humphrey fear old jacob seen lymington 
fear tell opinion rear imagination 
surely would hurt us walked without arms like people father fought king beheaded people true plotting king favor ways opposed parliament 
gathered jacob see fear remain quiet 
comes question edward jacob believe said one subject 
suppose leave forest would first step would take course state take possession father property arnwood mine descent 
exactly jacob thinks says would ruin property sequestered call forfeited parliament consequence father fought king side 
longer belongs would allowed take contrary would probability imprisoned knows might take place see danger jacob say yes told dare speak subject fiery heard property confiscated would certainly rash act anything kind would pretence laying hold said think would live long weaker every day hoped life would spared another year two might keep quiet till better times came 
said supposed burnt house fired would give fair opportunity calling impostor treating accordingly many anxious gift property would thousands people compassing death 
said making known claiming property would conduct enemies would wish follow would attended fatal consequences said prove edward beverley must declare sisters forest disclosure would put whole family power bitterest enemies would become sisters would impossible say likely would put charge puritan family would pleasure ill treating humiliating daughters man colonel beverley 
tell afraid say anything thought would mad idea injustice would something rash said pray every night otherwise useless life may spared die know edward would quit forest 
never sisters protection replied edward safe would morrow 
think edward great truth jacob says could good would restore property making seclusion known present might great deal harm bide time good advice troubled times 
therefore think wary still think fear either going forest present dresses name armitage 
one would recognize us grown tall tanned sunburnt air exercise look like children forest sons colonel beverley 
humphrey speak sensibly agree 
quite fiery old man thinks bosom burns indignation events sufficient power conceal feelings necessary 
oppose art art becomes requisite said believe really 
one thing certain king charles prisoner party dispersed gone abroad nothing make known would injure us 
keep quiet therefore certainly shall also remain false name still must mix people know going 
willing live forest protect sisters long necessary although reside confined forest altogether 
exactly think edward wish let us hasty even 
wish pleasant ride edward procure keepers small shot much wish 
forget good bye brother 
humphrey returned home attend farm yard edward continued journey forest 
estimate character two boys may formed conversation 
edward courageous impetuous hasty resolves still open conviction 
brought heir property felt humphrey could expected mortification left pauper high prospects early days vindictive feelings opposite party therefore keen spirit mounted conviction labored 
disposition naturally warlike disposition fostered father child still kinder heart generous lad never existed 
humphrey much subdued philosophical temperament perhaps well calculated lead advise great prudence united courage passive courage rather active one courage assailed would defend valiantly would wary reflective would attack 
humphrey spirit chivalry possessed edward 
younger son earn way fortune felt inclinations peace strife 
moreover humphrey talents edward natural talent mechanics inquisitive research science far limited education would permit 
fitted engineer agriculturist soldier although doubt would made brave soldier become avocation 
kindness generosity nature equal brother reason angry word never passed question way give wishes 
hardly need say never two brothers attached mutually respected
