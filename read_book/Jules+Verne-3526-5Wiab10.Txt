huzza huzza shouted immense audience completely electrified inspiring words

wildest cheering resounded sides name ferguson every mouth may safely believe lost nothing passing english throats 
indeed hall fairly shook 
present also fearless travellers explorers whose energetic temperaments borne every quarter globe many grown old worn service science 
degree physically morally undergone sorest trials

man forty years age medium height physique

hence applause greeted outset continued friendly gesture claimed silence behalf 
stepped toward seat prepared presentation standing erect motionless determined glance pointed right forefinger upward pronounced aloud single word excelsior never one bright cobden sudden onslaughts never one palmerston abrupt demands funds plate rocks english coast iron made sensation 
sir francis address completely overshadowed 
doctor shown moderate sublime self contained one uttered word situation excelsior gouty old admiral finding fault completely singular man immediately moved insertion dr ferguson speech proceedings royal geographical society london 
person enterprise proposed ferguson father brave worthy captain english navy associated son young man earliest years perils adventures profession 
fine little fellow seemed never known meaning fear early revealed keen active mind investigating intelligence remarkable turn scientific study moreover disclosed uncommon address extricating difficulty never perplexed even handling fork first time exercise children generally little success

many well employed hour passed hero isle juan fernandez often criticised ideas shipwrecked sailor sometimes discussed plans projects

one thing satisfied never left pleasant island happy king without subjects inducement held promotion first lordship admiralty may readily conjectured whether tendencies developed youth adventure spent every nook corner globe 
moreover father man thorough instruction omitted opportunity consolidate keen intelligence serious studies hydrography physics mechanics along slight tincture botany medicine astronomy 
upon death estimable captain samuel ferguson twenty two years age already made voyage around world 
enlisted bengalese corps engineers distinguished several affairs soldier life exactly suited caring little command fond obeying

nothing less surprising find traveller period visiting whole region west thibet company brothers schlagintweit bringing back curious ethnographic observations expedition 
different journeys ferguson active interesting correspondent daily telegraph penny newspaper whose circulation amounts copies yet scarcely suffices many legions readers 
thus doctor become well known public although could claim membership either royal geographical societies london paris berlin vienna st petersburg yet travellers club even royal polytechnic institute friend statistician cockburn ruled state

story told englishman came one day geneva intending visit lake 
placed one odd vehicles passengers sit side side omnibus 
well happened englishman got seat left back turned toward lake 
vehicle completed circular trip without thinking turn around went back london delighted lake geneva 
doctor ferguson however turned around look journeyings turned good purpose seen great deal 
simply obeyed laws nature good reason believe extent fatalist orthodox school fatalism withal led rely upon even upon providence

dr ferguson long engaged upon details expedition 
easy comprehend balloon marvellous vehicle convey air constant object solicitude 
outset order give balloon ponderous dimensions decided fill hydrogen gas fourteen half times lighter common air 
production gas easy given greatest satisfaction hitherto aerostatic experiments 
doctor according accurate calculations found including articles indispensable journey apparatus carry weight pounds therefore find would ascensional force balloon capable raising weight consequently would capacity 
weight four thousand pounds represented displacement air amounting forty four thousand eight hundred forty seven cubic feet words forty four thousand eight hundred forty seven cubic feet air weigh four thousand pounds 
giving balloon cubic dimensions filling hydrogen gas instead common air former fourteen half times lighter weighing therefore two hundred seventy six pounds difference three thousand seven hundred twenty four pounds equilibrium produced difference weight gas contained balloon weight surrounding atmosphere constitutes ascensional force former 
however forty four thousand eight hundred forty seven cubic feet gas speak introduced balloon would entirely filled would balloon continued mount rarefied layers atmosphere gas within would dilate soon burst cover containing 
balloons usually two thirds filled 
doctor carrying project known resolved fill balloon one half since carry forty four thousand eight hundred forty seven cubic feet gas give balloon nearly double capacity arranged elongated oval shape come preferred 
horizontal diameter fifty feet vertical diameter seventy five feet 
thus obtained spheroid capacity amounted round numbers ninety thousand cubic feet 
could dr ferguson used two balloons chances success would increased one burst air could throwing ballast keep 
management two balloons would necessarily difficult view problem keep equal ascensional force 
pondered matter carefully dr ferguson ingenious arrangement combined advantages two balloons without incurring inconveniences 
constructed two different sizes inclosed smaller larger one 
external balloon dimensions given contained less one shape forty five feet horizontal sixty eight feet vertical diameter 
capacity interior balloon sixty seven thousand cubic feet float fluid surrounding 
valve opened one balloon thus enabled aeronaut communicate 
arrangement offered advantage gas let descend outer balloon would go first completely emptied smaller one would still remain intact 
outer envelope might cast useless encumbrance second balloon left free would offer hold currents air half inflated one must needs present 
moreover case accident happening outside balloon getting torn instance would remain intact 
balloons made strong light lyons silk coated gutta percha 
gummy resinous substance absolutely water proof also resists acids gas perfectly 
silk doubled upper extremity oval strain would come 
envelope could retain inflating fluid length time 
weighed half pound per nine square feet 
hence surface outside balloon eleven thousand six hundred square feet envelope weighed six hundred fifty pounds 
envelope second inner balloon nine thousand two hundred square feet surface weighed five hundred ten pounds say eleven hundred sixty pounds 
network supported car made strong hempen cord two valves object minute careful attention rudder ship would 
car circular form fifteen feet diameter made wicker work strengthened slight covering iron protected system elastic springs deaden shock collision 
weight along network exceed two hundred fifty pounds 
addition doctor caused constructed two sheet iron chests two lines thickness 
connected means pipes furnished stopcocks 
joined spiral two inches diameter terminated two branch pieces unequal length longer however twenty five feet height shorter fifteen feet 
sheet iron chests embedded car way take least possible amount space 
spiral adjusted future moment packed separately along strong buntzen electric battery 
apparatus ingeniously combined weigh seven hundred pounds even including twenty five gallons water another receptacle 
instruments provided journey consisted two barometers two thermometers two compasses sextant two chronometers artificial horizon altazimuth throw height distant inaccessible objects 
greenwich observatory placed doctor disposal 
latter however intend make experiments physics merely wanted able know direction passing determine position principal rivers mountains towns 
also provided three thoroughly tested iron anchors light strong silk ladder fifty feet length 
time carefully weighed stores provision consisted tea coffee biscuit salted meat pemmican preparation comprises many nutritive elements small space 
besides sufficient stock pure brandy arranged two water tanks contained twenty two gallons

thus passed long evenings forecastle merry chat time doctor went instructive discourses 
one day conversation turned upon means directing balloons doctor asked opinion 
think said shall succeed finding system directing 
familiar plans attempted proposed one succeeded one practicable 
may readily understand occupied mind subject necessarily interesting able solve problem appliances known mechanical science 
would discover motive power extraordinary force almost impossible lightness machinery 
even could resist atmospheric currents considerable strength 
effort rather direct car balloon one great error 
still many points resemblance balloon ship directed 
retorted doctor little similarity two cases 
air infinitely less dense water ship half submerged whole bulk balloon plunged atmosphere remains motionless reference element surrounds 
think aerostatic science said last word must look another point case manage guide balloon must least try keep favorable aerial currents 
proportion ascend latter become much uniform flow constantly one direction 
longer disturbed mountains valleys traverse surface globe know chief cause variations wind inequality force 
therefore zones determined balloon merely placed currents best adapted destination 
continued captain bennet order reach must keep constantly ascending descending 
real difficulty doctor 
dear captain let us understand one another 
would difficulty obstacle long journeys short aerial excursions 
please ascend throwing ballast descend letting gas processes ballast gas soon exhausted 
dear sir whole question 
difficulty science need seek overcome 
problem guide balloon take without expending gas strength life blood soul may use expression 
right dear doctor problem yet solved means yet discovered 
beg pardon discovered 
may readily believe otherwise risked expedition across africa balloon 
twenty four hours without gas said nothing england want overhauled public 
saw use 
made preparatory experiments secret satisfied

calorifere 
system manoeuvring 
success certain 
attempt often made gentlemen said doctor rise descend without losing ballast gas balloon 
french aeronaut meunier tried accomplish compressing air inner receptacle 
belgian dr van hecke means wings paddles obtained vertical power would sufficed cases practical results secured experiments insignificant 
therefore resolved go thing directly start dispensed ballast altogether excepting provision cases special emergency breakage apparatus necessity ascending suddenly avoid unforeseen obstacles 
means ascent descent consist simply dilating contracting gas balloon application different temperatures method obtaining result 
saw bring board car several cases receptacles use may understood 
five number 
first contains twenty five gallons water add drops sulphuric acid augment capacity conductor electricity decompose means powerful buntzen battery 
water know consists two parts hydrogen one oxygen gas 
latter action battery passes positive pole second receptacle 
third receptacle placed second one double capacity receives hydrogen passing negative pole 
stopcocks one orifice twice size communicate receptacles fourth one called mixture reservoir since two gases obtained decomposition water really commingle 
capacity fourth tank forty one cubic feet 
upper part tank platinum tube provided stopcock 
readily understand gentlemen apparatus described really gas cylinder blow pipe oxygen hydrogen heat exceeds forge fire 
much established proceed second part apparatus 
lowest part balloon hermetically closed issue two tubes little distance apart 
one starts among upper layers hydrogen gas amid lower layers 
two pipes provided intervals strong jointings india rubber enable move harmony oscillations balloon 
run far car lose iron receptacle cylindrical form called heat tank 
latter closed two ends two strong plates metal 
pipe running lower part balloon runs cylindrical receptacle lower plate penetrates latter takes form helicoidal screw shaped spiral rings rising one occupy nearly whole height tank 
issuing spiral runs small cone concave base turned downward shape spherical cap 
top cone second pipe issues runs said upper beds balloon 
spherical cap small cone platinum melt action cylinder blow pipe latter placed upon bottom iron tank midst helicoidal spiral extremity flame slightly touch cap question 
know gentlemen calorifere heat apartments 
know acts 
air apartments forced pass pipes released heightened temperature 
well described nothing less calorifere 
fact takes place cylinder lighted hydrogen spiral concave cone becomes heated rapidly ascends pipe leads upper part balloon 
vacuum created attracts gas lower parts becomes heated turn continually replaced thus extremely rapid current gas established pipes spiral issues balloon returns heated incessantly 
cases increase volume degree heat applied 
force temperature degrees hydrogen balloon dilate cubic feet therefore displace cubic feet air increase ascensional power pounds 
equivalent throwing weight ballast 
augment temperature degrees gas dilate displace cubic feet ascensional force augmented pounds 
thus see gentlemen easily effect considerable changes equilibrium 
volume balloon calculated manner half inflated displaces weight air exactly equal envelope containing hydrogen gas car occupied passengers apparatus accessories 
point inflation exact equilibrium air neither mounts descends 
order effect ascent give gas temperature superior temperature surrounding air means cylinder 
excess heat obtains larger distention inflates balloon 
latter ascends proportion heat hydrogen 
descent course effected lowering heat cylinder letting temperature abate 
ascent would usually rapid descent fortunate circumstance since importance descend rapidly hand rapid ascent avoid obstacles 
real danger lurks 
besides said certain quantity ballast enable ascend rapidly still necessary 
valve top balloon nothing less safety valve 
balloon always retains quantity hydrogen variations temperature produce midst shut gas sufficient provide ascending descending movements 
gentlemen practical detail let add combustion hydrogen oxygen point cylinder produces solely vapor steam water 
therefore provided lower part cylindrical iron box scape pipe valve operating means pressure two atmospheres consequently soon amount pressure attained steam escapes 
exact figures gallons water separated constituent elements yield pounds oxygen pounds hydrogen 
represents atmospheric tension cubic feet former cubic feet latter cubic feet mixture 
hence stopcock cylinder fully open expends cubic feet per hour flame least six times strong large lamps used lighting streets 
average order keep moderate elevation burn nine cubic feet per hour twenty five gallons water represent six hundred thirty six hours aerial navigation little twenty six days 
well descend please replenish stock water way trip might indefinitely prolonged 
gentlemen secret 
simple like simple things fail succeed 
dilation contraction gas balloon means locomotion calls neither cumbersome wings mechanical motor 
calorifere produce changes temperature cylinder generate heat neither inconvenient heavy 
think therefore combined elements success

next day wind came south balloon moved slowly vast plateau mountains extinct craters barren ravines drop water parched crests piles broken rocks huge stony masses scattered hither thither interspersed whitish marl indicated complete sterility 
toward noon doctor purpose burying body decided descend ravine midst plutonic rocks primitive formation 
surrounding mountains would shelter enable bring car ground tree sight could make fast 
explained kennedy impossible descend except releasing quantity gas proportionate loss ballast time rescued missionary 
therefore opened valve outside balloon 
hydrogen escaped victoria quietly descended ravine 
soon car touched ground doctor shut valve 
joe leaped holding rim car one hand gathering quantity stones equal weight 
could use hands soon heaped car five hundred pounds stones enabled doctor kennedy turn get 
thus victoria found balanced ascensional force insufficient raise 
moreover necessary gather many stones blocks extremely heavy much indeed doctor attention attracted circumstance 
soil fact bestrewn quartz porphyritic rocks

yes gold mine said doctor quietly 
blocks trampling foot like worthless stones contain gold ore great purity 
impossible impossible repeated joe 
would look long among fissures slaty schist without finding peptites considerable value 
joe rushed like crazy man among scattered fragments kennedy long following example 
keep cool joe said master 
doctor speak thing quite ease 
philosopher mettle ah master philosophy holds good case come come let us reflect little 
good would wealth carry away us 
take us indeed rather heavy car even hesitated tell thing fear exciting regret said joe abandon treasures fortune us really us leave behind take care friend would yield thirst gold dead man helped bury taught vanity human affairs true replied joe gold mr kennedy help gather trifle millions could joe said hunter unable repress smile 
come hither search fortune take one home us 
millions rather heavy know resumed doctor easily put one pocket 
least said joe driven last defences take ore ballast instead sand good consent said doctor must make many wry faces come throw thousands crowns worth overboard 
thousands crowns echoed joe possible much gold yes friend reservoir nature heaping wealth centuries enough enrich whole nations australia california together midst wilderness whole remain useless perhaps events console

listen take exact bearings spot give upon return england tell countrymen let share think much gold would make happy 
ah master give see right nothing else done 
let us fill car precious mineral remains end trip much made 
joe went work 
might soon collected thousand pieces quartz contained gold enclosed though extremely hard crystal casket 
doctor watched smile joe went took bearings found missionary grave lay twenty two degrees twenty three minutes east longitude four degrees fifty five minutes north latitude 
casting one glance swelling soil beneath body poor frenchman reposed went back car

anxiety another sort began steal doctor mind 
would given much gold little water replace thrown overboard negro carried air 
impossible find arid regions reflection gave great uneasiness 
feed cylinder continually even began find enough quench thirst party 
therefore determined lose opportunity replenishing supply 
upon getting back car found burdened quartz blocks joe greed heaped

kennedy laughed 
joe threw ten pounds balloon stood still 
joe got pale 
poor fellow said doctor 
mr kennedy weigh unless mistaken four hundred pounds get rid least weight since put make us 
throw away four hundred pounds said joe piteously

one night 
balloon made fast solitary tree almost completely dried aridity region stood passed night perfect quietness travellers enabled enjoy little repose greatly needed 
emotions day left sad impressions minds 
toward morning sky resumed brilliant purity heat 
balloon ascended several ineffectual attempts fell current although rapid bore toward northwest

joe cast mournful glance doctor made reply 
thinking without secret terror probably vast solitudes sahara whole weeks sometimes pass without caravans meeting single spring water 
occupied thoughts scrutinized every depression soil closest attention 
anxieties incidents recently occurring without effect upon spirits three travellers 
conversed less wrapt thoughts 
joe clever lad seemed longer person since gaze plunged ocean gold 
kept entirely silent gazed incessantly upon stony fragments heaped car worthless day inestimable value morrow 
appearance part africa moreover quite calculated inspire alarm desert gradually expanding around another village seen even collection huts vegetation also disappearing 
barely dwarf plants could noticed like wild heaths scotland came first tract grayish sand flint lentisk tree brambles 
midst sterility rudimental carcass globe appeared ridges sharply jutting rock 
symptoms totally dry barren region greatly disquieted dr ferguson 
seemed though caravan ever braved desert expanse would left visible traces encampments whitened bones men animals 
nothing kind seen aeronauts felt ere long immensity sand would cover whole desolate region 
however going back must go forward indeed doctor asked nothing better would even welcomed tempest carry beyond country 
cloud sky 
close day balloon made thirty miles 
lack water remained three gallons doctor put aside one gallon destined quench burning thirst heat ninety degrees rendered intolerable 
two gallons remained supply cylinder 
hence could produce four hundred eighty cubic feet gas yet cylinder consumed nine cubic feet per hour 
consequently could keep longer fifty four hours mathematical calculation fifty four hours said doctor companions 
therefore determined travel night fear passing stream pool three days half journeying must find water hazards 
thought duty make aware real state case retained one gallon drinking shall put shortest allowance 
put us short allowance doctor responded kennedy must despair 
three days left say yes dear dick well grieving matter help us three days time enough decide upon done meanwhile let us redouble vigilance evening meal water strictly measured brandy increased quantity punch drank 
careful spirits latter likely produce quench thirst 
car rested night upon immense plateau deep hollow height scarcely eight hundred feet level sea 
circumstance gave doctor hope since recalled mind conjectures geographers concerning existence vast stretch water center africa

tranquil night starry magnificence succeeded unchanging daylight blazing rays sun earliest dawn temperature became scorching 
five clock morning doctor gave signal departure considerable time balloon remained immovable leaden atmosphere 
doctor might escaped intense heat rising higher range order would consume large quantity water thing become impossible 
contented therefore keeping balloon one hundred feet ground elevation feeble current drove toward western horizon 
breakfast consisted little dried meat pemmican 
noon victoria advanced miles

ah doctor one occasions propeller would thing despised 
undoubtedly dick provided would require expenditure water put motion case situation would precisely moreover time nothing practical sort invented 
balloons still point ships invention steam 
took six thousand years invent propellers screws time enough yet 
confounded heat said joe wiping away perspiration streaming forehead 
water heat would service us dilates hydrogen balloon diminishes amount required spiral although true short useful liquid economize 
ah rascally savage cost us tank water tank thrown overboard native clung car 
regret though doctor dick since power save unfortunate missionary horrible death 
hundred pounds water threw overboard would useful us would thirteen fourteen days progress secured quite enough carry us desert 
made least half journey asked joe 
distance yes duration wind leave us even tendency die away altogether 
come sir said joe must complain got along pretty well thus far whatever happens get desperate 
find water mind tell 
soil however ran lower mile mile undulations gold bearing mountains left died away plain like last throes exhausted nature 
scanty grass took place fine trees east belts half scorched herbage still contended invasion sand huge rocks rolled distant summits crushed fall scattered sharp edged pebbles soon became coarse sand finally impalpable dust

see added laughing confidence part forests prairies reason 
use coming far find scenery like england first time believe africa sorry get taste 
toward evening doctor calculated balloon made twenty miles whole burning day heated gloom closed upon soon sun disappeared behind horizon traced sky precision straight line 
next day thursday st may days followed desperate monotony 
morning like one preceded noon poured exhaustless rays night condensed shadow scattered heat ensuing day would bequeath succeeding night 
wind scarcely observable rather gasp breath morning could almost foreseen even gasp would cease 
doctor reacted gloominess situation retained coolness self possession disciplined heart

thereupon laid whole state case plainly showed done yet worst could return attempt least 
think opinion excellent master said joe may suffer suffer better perhaps 
goes go kennedy doctor man despair one less ignorant perils enterprise want see moment determined brave 
present circumstances opinion persevere go clear end 
besides return looks quite perilous course 
onward may count upon us thanks gallant friends replied doctor much real feeling expected devotion needed encouraging words 
yet thank bottom heart three friends warmly grasped hand 
hear said doctor 
according solar observations three hundred miles gulf guinea desert therefore extend indefinitely since coast inhabited country explored distance back interior 
needs direct course quarter seems question come across oasis well could replenish stock water
