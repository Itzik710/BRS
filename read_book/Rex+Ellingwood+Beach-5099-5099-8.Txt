dawn heart sunset water hole fitful breeze played among mesquite bushes 
naked earth showed clumps grass baked plaster hard 
burned like hot slag except panting lizard dust gray jack rabbit startled covert nothing animate stirred upon face 
high motionless blinding sky buzzard poised long tailed mexican crows among thorny branches creaked whistled choked rattled snored grunted dove mourned inconsolably air issued metallic insect cries direction whence came unascertainable source hidden 
although sun half way west glare remained untempered tantalizing shade sparse mesquite trial comfort lone woman refusing deceitful invitation plodded steadily waste 
stop indeed dared 
spite fatigue regardless torture feet limbs unused walking must constantly assured keep going strength failed 
far fortunately kept head retained sufficient reason deny fanciful apprehensions clamored audience 
allowed become panicky knew would fare worse far worse ever needed faculties 
somewhere northward perhaps mile perhaps league distant lay water hole 
country deadly deceitful sameness devoid landmarks lacking well defined water courses 
unending mesquite first spring foliage resembled limitless peach orchard sown careless unbelievably prodigal hand 
false acres occasional knolls low stony hills lifted one came vantage points eye leaped great distances across imperceptible valleys horizons far away scattered tree clumps blended unbroken carpet green 
woman outlooks unutterably depressing merely serving reveal vastness desolation 
crest rise paused studied country carefully without avail 
felt dizzily desert bag swung shoulder find flat dry galvanized mouthpiece burned fingers 
little shock remembered done thing several times repeated forgetting frightened since seemed show mind slightly unbalanced heat 
perhaps explained distant horizon swam wavered 
probability man situated would spoken aloud endeavor steady woman nothing sort 
seating densest shade could find really shade closed eyes relaxed easy thing stifling temperature throat aching drought 
length opened eyes find could make nothing familiar 
undoubtedly lost water hole might anywhere 
listened tensely air seemed listen leaves hushed faint whisperings near cactus held forty fleshy ears alert others distant poised harkening attitude 
seemed woman thousand ears straining yet sound came save monotonous crescendo diminuendo locust cries coming nowhere retreating voids 
last satisfied leaves began whisper softly 
away left lay yellow flood rio grande woman though tempted swing direction knew better yield 
least twenty miles barrens lay told could never cover distance 
water hole nearer must close hand 
could think little clearly could locate 
tried tried many times recall exact point shot horse map mind eye foot weary course traveled point onward 
desert travel nothing new thirst fatigue old acquaintances yet could help wondering spite training spite inborn sense direction prided upon sharing wild creatures fated become victim chaparral 
possibility remote death moment seemed far ever anything far 
would find water hole somehow unexpected would happen always one dire straits 
young strong die yet 
death easily 
rising readjusted strap empty water bag shoulder loose cartridge belt hip set dusty feet slope 
day died lingeringly 
sun gradually lost cruelty partial relief heat merely emphasized traveler thirst muscular distress 
onward plodded using eyes carefully knew 
watched evening flight doves thinking guide course shrewd enough read signs correctly 
tracks found old part led particular direction nowhere uniting anything like trail 
wondered could bring drink blood jack rabbit would quench thirst 
thought repellent besides good shot revolver 
cactus offer relief since coming bloom yet bore fruit 
sun grown red huge last hard baked dirt discovered fresh hoof prints 
seemed lead along line traveling followed gladly encouraged joined others although meandered aimlessly formed something like trail anything yet seen 
guessing general direction hurried coming finally region soil shallow scarcely served cover rocky substratum 
low bluff rose left along crest scattered spanish daggers raggedly silhouetted sky 
well defined path tried run legs heavy stumbled great deal breath made strange distressing sounds issued open lips 
hounding steep shoulder ridge hastened declivity knot scrub oaks ebony trees halted staring ahead 
nakedness stony arroyo gnarled stunted thickets softened magic twilight air suddenly cooled overhead empty flawless sky deepening swiftly blue purple chaparral awakened echoed sounds life

ii ambush alaire austin slept badly 
day hardships left traces 
toxins fatigue poisoned muscles aches pains drugged brain rendered night long succession tortures experienced second time agonies thirst fatigue despair 
extreme physical ordeals like profound emotional upheavals leave imprints upon brain body may recover quickly often requires considerable time rest exhausted nerves 
finer nervous organism slower process recuperation 
like normal women alaire surprising amount endurance nervous muscular drawn heavily reserve force paid penalty 
early hours night slept hardly soon bodily discomfort began decrease mind became unruly 
twice rose limped water hole drink nearly dawn dropped complete unconsciousness

next afternoon known mexico canadian border old ranchman shot mexican soldiers romero 
reported party americans invaded foreign soil snatched ricardo remains nose general longorio 
reliable information ceased 
rescue effected done reasons prompted mystery 
first story newspapers printed terse telegram signed captain evans addressed governor texas read ranger force crossed rio grande brought back body ricardo guzman 
message created tremendous enthusiasm texas rangers ever stood prompt decisive action two hours publication despatch came sharp inquiry washington heels state house austin denied receipt message 
denial turn made public newspapers demanded know performed sensational exploit

even jonesville conflicting rumors 
whatever facts rescue generally recognized result bring crisis affairs two nations 
people declared since outrage proven next move duty state department washington 
therefore several days passed nothing done wide spread feeling indignation grew 
mattered diplomatic communications two governments asked 
wait another investigation general longorio strong influences however work prevent outcome people texas prayed 
delay arose report ricardo guzman borne evil reputation actively associated rebel cause warrant punishment federal government 
moreover legal question american citizenship raised question seemed important bearing upon case 
public interest short lived living men hold day two reckons dead man worthy obituary notice 
mexican offenses equally grave failed stir administration definite action death obscure border ranchman seem weigh heavily washington 
thus course time guzman incident fair way officially forgotten forgiven 
course people texas forget personally known ricardo forgive 
dave law instance felt bitter matter counted upon prompt definite results 
little pressure properly applied would wrung truth colonel blanco fastened measure guilt upon men actually arranged murder 
dave doubt tad lewis part one source pressure could brought failed found efforts blocked 
remained consolation knowing measure squared account old ricardo 
several persons felt intense relief course events taken among alaire austin

relations becoming constantly difficult realized impossible go way much longer 
leaving ed rifled safe thus disregarding second time explicit agreement wife 
course welcome whatever money needed even excess allowance act showed weak sense honor strengthened alaire conviction every way rapidly deteriorating 
yet could believe really wicked heart many qualities average could convince criminally involved tad lewis schemes

longings strangers alaire old persistent enemies late prospect loveless childless future growing unbearable 
even day dreams failed give customary relief imaginary figures took counsel strangely unresponsive 
told paloma jones dream children confessed existence another far intimate creature brain one occupied place ed austin held
