life governess cheerful cause one regret leaving 
gregory hartley wife went alexandria established three bright rooms upper part house commanded view port sea beyond 
outlay required furniture small indeed matting floors cushions divans ran round rooms bed simple cooking utensils small stock crockery sufficed 
mr ferguson manager branch first read letter gregory brought doubt mind wisdom principal sending man evidently gentleman 
feeling however soon wore away found perfectly ready undertake work set 
indeed nothing absolutely unpleasant 
office early saw native swept dusted offices 
rest day either warehouse carried messages generally odd jobs required 
fortnight arrival one clerks kept away sharp attack fever work pressing agent asked gregory take place 
best sir know nothing mercantile accounts 
work way difficult 
mr hardman take mr parrot ledgers copy storekeeper issues books five minutes show form entered 
gregory gave satisfaction afterwards employed office work whenever pressure 
year half passed comfortably 
end twelve months pay raised another ten shillings week 
leaving england signed contract remain firm two years 
regretted prevented accepting better position opening occur recognized condition fair one firm paying outfit two passages 
end eighteen months gregory began look something better 
mind work bit said wife sake boy son born months arrival must try raise scale bit 
nothing complain office far 
manager said day vacancy occurred office offer berth 
course would step know books hardman gets two hundred year forty 
like get something else gregory 
troubles think half time spent packing goods warehouse work sort even got less would much rather even stint work suitable past could associate gentlemen even terms 
trouble dear except wish society among ladies 
however sake boy like certainly keep lookout better position 
often regretted go commission army 
want father would hear 
time luck might got company though pay would get would quarters much different social position 
however use talking indeed difficult make plans 
things unsettled condition saying happen 
see arabi military party practically masters 
tewfik obliged make concession concession dismiss ministers orders submit series humiliations 
moment arabi could dethrone whole army back certainly larger portion population 
revolution could completed without trouble bloodshed see complicated fact tewfik support english french governments little doubt populace regard movement national one directed much foreign control interference tewfik ground complaint whatever 
part army generals trouble arisen solely account favouritism shown circassian officers 
revolution commenced certain widen 
peasantry everywhere fanatically hostile foreigners 
attacks made upon various country districts arabi triumphant position christians become precarious 
matters evidently seen light england heard today office british french squadrons expected day two 
row position unpleasant 
hardly think arabi would venture try strength fleets fancy trouble first place begin cairo capital country beyond reach armed interference powers 
arabi natural course would consolidate power throughout whole egypt leaving alexandria severely alone obtained absolute authority elsewhere 
anyhow satisfaction fleet first rumor outbreak get baby board one ships lying harbor 
simple measure precaution would suggest go evening buy one costumes worn native women 
long blue robe enveloping head foot one hideous white cotton veils falling eyes 
get bottle iodine darken forehead eyelids could pass unsuspected crowd 
going gregory get native dress must remember though possible come may able case hear tumult going must take baby go port 
know enough language able tell boatman take one steamers port 
soon get away shall go round port shall find without difficulty 
still anticipate trouble arising without sufficient warning allow come see settled board ship keep office closes join 
course remote trust occasion never arise 
still doubt situation critical harm making preparations worst 
rate dear beg go alone till matters settled 
shopping together come back office 
one thing reason grateful 
even worst comes worst christians leave country object came attained 
heard cough months laid fifty pounds written forty stories long short go back fair hope making way sure write better used good many stories laid egypt local coloring give distinctive character likely accepted wrote 
editors magazines like succession tales kind 
present doubt arrival fleet render position comfortable present 
mere mob town would hesitate attack europeans know three four thousand sailors could land half hour 
hand arabi generals might see alexandria important position foreign interference must arrested 
surprised arrival ships tewfik arabi leaders movement come 
tewfik come get support fleet 
arabi come oppose landing troops 
war beginning century decided alexandria may 
sure would come harm think chances small would immensely interesting break monotony one life 
one thing fairly certain 
anything like regular row commercial work come end matters settled case even offices altogether closed whole staff recalled england would glad enough allow leave instead keeping two years agreement signed starting 
hardly think would tumult gregory 
natives seem gentle peaceable army composed sort men 
kept centuries annie deep fanatical feeling every mussulman nature rate great proportion officers army mussulmans 
kopts would danger trouble cry death christians would excite every mahomedan land almost madness 
unfortunately general belief whether truly founded although french representative apparently acting concert french officials secretly encouraging arabi take active steps whatever 
case doubtful whether england would act alone 
jealousy two peoples intense 
years french thwarting us every turn may well think however matters might finally go interference would make us unpopular egypt influence would become completely paramount 
supremacy egypt always dream french 
command sea would obtained possession country napoleon time 
intrigues years incessant 
newspapers egypt continually maligned us believe time come real nominal rulers egypt 
making suez canal quite much political commercial move certainly added largely influence though respect check given purchase khedive shares canal lord beaconsfield stroke however greatly increased enmity french heightened efforts excite animosity people us 
well hope whatever comes question whose influence paramount egypt finally settled 
even french domination would better constant intrigues trouble keep land state agitation 
however fancy way english fleet comes trouble 
think shall back begin earnest sure win long run 
france must see refuses act last moment arabi power produce documents showing along acting accordance secret advice 
week later th may squadrons england france anchored alexandria 
british fleet consisted eight ironclads five gunboats carrying three thousand five hundred thirty nine men one hundred two guns commanded sir frederick seymour 
two days approach fleet known cairo french english consuls proposed khedive issue decree declaring general amnesty president council minister war three military pashas quit country year 
request complied 
ministry resigned body day fleet arrived ground khedive acquiesced foreign interference 
great meeting held chief personages state officers representatives army told khedive refused obey orders recognized authority porte 
alexandria trade ceased became known troops busy strengthening forts mounting cannon preparing resistance 
done orders arabi practically dictator could question 
native population became excited firmly belief vessels could resist fire heavy guns attempt part men war reduce place would end sunk soon fighting began 
office stores still kept open gregory duties almost nominal mr parrot also married told manager could spend greater portion time homes 
part gregory duties consisted going vessels came port goods firm seeing brought shore difficulty making arrangements captain one ships wife child go board trouble town 
hear sounds tumult annie must disguise go wharf 
arranged boatman allen know well often gone sail evening hears outbreak shall bring boat steps end street take simoon 
course shall come house one marked suitable defense 
men half dozen establishments gather belonging house must aid defense 
course get sufficient warning shall slip disguise hurry see boat make way back place 
wait 
come find gone shall know taken alarm time shall return office 
course outbreak commences near find way water blocked simply put disguise stain face wait till come till see way water clear 
attempt go mob 
likely women among 
however anticipate serious riot 
may attack europeans street fourteen fifteen men war port likely make organized assault 
arabi agents hardly precipitate matters way 
hard may work take month get defences proper order rising merely spasmodic outbreak fanaticism 
think danger likely pressing finding remonstrances vain admiral begins bombard port 
exactly tell gregory 
alone could bring leave without must think child 
quite dear 
first consideration 
certainly comes fight much comfortable knowledge baby safety 
egyptian soldiers quartered part outside town days danger would enter attack european inhabitants arabi orders strict gave command remain quiet 
british admiral sent messages tewfik insisting work upon fortifications cease latter issued orders effect wholly disobeyed 
indeed shadow authority remaining work continued night day 
however much possible concealed observation search lights suddenly turned upon forts night showed swarming men 
things went comparative quiet till th june although attitude natives threatening europeans left houses except urgent business 
day sudden uproar heard 
pistols fired merchants closed stores barricaded doors 
gregory harbor time jumping boat rowed stairs hurried home 
found wife already disguised readiness leave 
street full excited people 
slipped disguise darkened face seizing moment crowd rushed street sound firearms end hurried boat rowed simoon 
must return dear said 
get back gate key stores brought way 
think need feel uneasiness 
row evidently still going guns fired 
certainly rascals attacking stores would hear steady musketry fire 
sound riot principally foreign quarter maltese greeks italians congregate 
doubt police soon put 
police however made attempt permitted work massacre take place eyes 
nearly two hundred europeans killed 
majority dwelt foreign quarter several merchants others set upon making way offices seamen fleet also among victims 
british consul dragged carriage severely injured 
consulate attacked several frenchmen killed streets 
khedive hurried cairo hearing news 
arabi sending best regiments alexandria pretending preparing raid upon suez canal 
receiving assistance dervish pasha sultan representative recognized sultan conferred upon highest order medjidie 
meantime conference held powers decided sultan entrusted work putting insurrection nominally lord paramount egypt 
conditions laid army leaving country afterwards 
sultan sent evasive reply 
khedive overwhelmed situation take decisive course 
france hesitated england determined without allies would take matter hand 
chapter rising alexandria 
harbor full merchant ships present means getting cargoes unloaded 
native boatmen part struck work willing man boats must remained idle view situation merchants felt goods much safer board ship would magazines 
settled therefore present annie child remain board simoon gregory take residence office 
fleet harbor imposing one 
english french squadrons italian ships war arrived united states cruiser th july sir beauchamp seymour sent decisive message commence bombardment fort unless strengthening fortifications abandoned 
heed taken intimation three days later sent ultimatum demanding cessation work immediate surrender forts nearest entrance harbor stating terms complied twenty four hours bombardment would commence 
already greater part european inhabitants left town taken quarters merchant ships engaged purpose 
however bankers merchants determined remain 
gathered bank mr ferguson house valuable goods establishments removed 
ample supply firearms believed could hold considerable time 
convinced egyptian troops would hour resist fire would opened upon would speedily evacuate town therefore would mob encountered short time sailors would land soon egyptian troops fled 
egyptians hand believed absolutely ability destroy fleet 
parties wrong 
europeans greatly undervalued fighting powers egyptians animated confidence strength defences number fanaticism egyptians similarly undervalued tremendous power ships 
evening next morning port presented animated appearance 
boats putting inhabitants waited hoping egyptians would last moment give 
many merchantmen already cleared 
others getting sail 
smoke rising funnels men war 
express boat brought france orders french fleet take part proceedings proceed port said 
order excited bitterest feeling anger humiliation among french officers sailors relied confidently taking part bombardment silently ships one one left port 
italian american vessels remained time british ships followed stately order crews manned rigging vociferously cheered sailors replied heartily 
save british men war took stations well sea direction would fire egyptian batteries 
nine clock evening two last british ships invincible monarch steamed port 
half past four morning ships got weigh moved positions marked 
fort mex batteries sand hills faced penelope monarch invincible alexandra superb sultan faced harbor forts ada pharos ras el teen temeraire inflexible prepared aid invincible attack fort mex support three battleships engaged port might required five gunboats moved away towards fort marabout lay distance west town 
seven clock alexandra began engagement firing single gun 
whole fleet opened fire egyptian artillerymen replying great steadiness resolution 
scarcely breath wind ships instants shrouded smoke frequently obliged cease firing drifted slowly away enable aim guns 
rattle machine guns added din 
midshipmen sent aloft signalled deck result shot gunners enabled direct fire even could see ten yards beyond muzzle guns 
short time forts batteries showed terrible effect great shells 
embrasures torn widened great gaps masonry buildings hail missiles machine guns swept every spot near egyptian guns yet arabi soldiers flinch spite number fell worked guns fast ever 
accustomed huge krupp guns batteries combat would equal although end would ships must suffered terribly 
fortunately egyptian artillerymen little experience working heavy pieces shot almost every case flew high sometimes masts sometimes instances striking hull 
smaller guns made good practice though shot pieces frequently struck dropped harmlessly iron sides entered portholes effected damage 
condor lord charles beresford first engage fort marabout time little gunboat mark guns fort 
four gunboats speedily came assistance effectually diverted fire fort ships engaging fort mex 
eight clock monarch silenced fort opposite dismounted guns joined inflexible penelope duel fort mex nine clock guns silenced except four two heavy rifled guns well sheltered 
spite heavy fire three great ships egyptian soldiers maintained fire officers frequently exposing bullets machine guns leaping upon parapet ascertain effect shot 
harbor forts time crumbling shot four warships opposed 
pharos suffered heavily guns absolutely silenced fire two forts slackened considerably 
half past ten seen ras el teen palace lay behind fort fire half hour later fire fort fort ada almost died 
british admiral gave signal cease firing smoke cleared away effects five hours bombardment visible 
forts batteries mere heaps ruins 
guns could made lying dismounted standing muzzles pointing upwards 
ships come scatheless injuries part immaterial although rigging cut away bulwarks smashed sides dinted 
one gun penelope disabled two alexandra 
five men killed altogether twenty seven wounded 
sign made surrender occasional fire kept forts prevent egyptians repairing damages 
one clock twelve volunteers invincible started destroy guns fort mex 
fire ceased men seen fort might lying wait attack landing party 
nearing shore surf found heavy boat pass major tulloch six men swam ashore entered fort 
found deserted guns two ten inch pieces dismounted 
charges gun cotton swimmers brought ashore placed cannon muzzles blown 
performing gallant service little party swam back boat 
british admiral position difficult one 
signs surrender aught could tell fifteen thousand egyptian troops might lying round ruined forts town hard readiness oppose landing 
troops despised evident gallantry fought guns 
force would aided mass population would hazardous indeed risk loss fifteen hundred men reversal success already gained 
time painful think europeans shore might massacred whole city destroyed exasperated troops fanatical population 
known number englishmen large two three hundred much larger number lower class europeans port labourers fishermen petty shopkeepers others preferred taking chance certainty losing little possessions left 
anxiously glasses board ships directed towards shore hopes seeing white flag hoisted boat come flying signs intentions defenders fleet prepared resume action morning 
fort marabout several batteries shore still unsilenced two heavy guns mounted moncrieff system gun rose level parapet fired instantly sank continued fire day spite efforts fleet silence 
next morning however long heavy swell ironclads rolling heavily anything like accuracy aim parties men could seen work moncrieff battery fire opened upon speedily evacuated 
night palace ras el teen burned fiercely 
another great fire raging heart town anxiety shore time overpowered feeling exultation victory gained 
half past ten white flag hoisted pharos battery board watched deep anxiety follow 
lieutenant lambton steamed fort bittern enquire government ready surrender 
three clock steamed news mission fruitless white flag hoisted officer command fort enable men get away unmolested 
lieutenant lambton obtained interview military governor behalf government told war egypt simply destroyed forts threatened fleet conditions impose upon government ready discuss proposal troops would allowed evacuate forts honor war 
unfortunate fleet brought two three thousand troops 
done could landed saved great portion town destruction soldiers admiral could land portion sailors large egyptian force town still protected number land batteries might fall upon 
five clock helicon sent say white flags would noticed unless hoisted authority shown british admiral would consider signs general surrender 
long time helicon returned news communication received enemy barracks arsenals seemed deserted far could seen whole town evacuated 
evening wore fresh fires broke parts town steam pinnace sent ashore ascertain possible state affairs 
mr ross contractor supply meat fleet volunteered accompany 
harbor dark deserted 
light seen houses near water 
crackling flames could heard occasional crash falling walls roofs 
nearing landing place pinnace paused two three minutes board listen quiet steamed alongside 
mr ross jumped ashore boat backed yards 
quarter hour later returned 
quarter town entirely deserted pushed arrested barrier flames 
great square fire end end european quarter generally flames could see litter strewed streets houses plundered fired 
daylight broke number europeans could seen edge water harbor 
boats lowered crews armed teeth rowed ashore 
found hundred europeans many wounded 
rioting broken arranged assembled anglo egyptian bank 
taken merchant steamers lying behind fleet information confirmed worst forebodings fugitives 
first gun bombardment fired gregory gone employees top house commanded view whole scene action 
first minutes firing could see little batteries ships alike shrouded smoke 
first feeling insecurity doubt whether shot highly aimed might come town orders abstain carefully injuring city well observed except palace houses close water edge damage done 
towards evening resolved remain behind gathered anglo egyptian bank mr ferguson consultation held later agreed next morning go bank far massive building fewer entrances greater facilities defense 
town quiet therefore employed transferring valuable goods house locked left fate 
mere rising rabble latter might successfully defended little doubt leaving town troops would join fanatics case house built special eye defense could hardly hope hold persistent attack 
bank however might hope make stout defense 
built massive stone lower windows barred strong barricade built massive doors 
hundred twenty resolute men well armed could hold even persistent attack unsupported artillery 
early afternoon felt critical moment approached 
throughout night fire raged opposite side great square several deserted houses broken plundered mob soldiers stationed square prevented disorder 
however parties troops forts began pour 
already known losses heavy many forts destroyed 
soon broke joining mob commenced work pillage 
doors blown shutters torn wild yells shouts native population poured 
work destruction begun 
garrison bank saw many europeans hurrying late reach shelter murdered eyes 
levantine quarter cracking pistols shouts men showed work massacre proceeding 
soon every door houses great square forced ere long great numbers men loaded spoil kinds staggered 
far bank left alone turn mob poured upon 
came sharp fire broke every window answered discharge muskets pistols crowd 
men fell fast worked pitch excitement fanaticism gaps filled fresh comers 
afternoon evening fight continued 
vain mob endeavored break massive iron bars windows batter doors 
although many defenders wounded several killed fire windows neighbouring houses road steady fire points hotly attacked drove assailants back 
twelve clock assault slackened 
soldiers long left far could seen roof house entirely evacuated town fact became known mob thought consequences action cooled fury knew probably troops would land british ships next day 
man plunder secure gradually crowd melted away 
two clock quiet although occasionally fresh fires burst various quarters town could little doubt great bulk population followed example army left city 
besieged gathered great office ground floor agreed would probably renewal attack quietly left house locking doors made way shore 
believed survivors reached end town found building credit lyonnais also successfully defended though ottoman bank overpowered within upwards hundred number killed 
gregory done full share defense received musket ball shoulder 
wife passed terrible time conflagration raging evident populace risen undoubtedly murdering well burning plundering delight indeed great saw husband others approaching man war boat 
fact one arm sling scarcely noticed joy return alive 
thank god safe said came gangway 
awful time almost given hope ever seeing alive 
told dear felt confident could beat scum town 
course sharp fight never real danger breaking 
lost half dozen nearly hundred twenty twenty us wounded 
injury serious shall soon right 
broken collarbone 
however terrible time 
great square almost european quarter entirely destroyed 
destruction property something frightful merchants absolutely ruined 
fortunately firm insured pretty well full value 
thought could break moved evening anglo egyptian bank 
town full troops doubted whether could hold place 
bank much stronger agreed better join two garrisons fight glad doubt whether could defended place successfully 
mr ferguson clerks come gregory simoon board plenty accommodation one ships taken accommodation fugitives 
among party came board doctor taken part defense bank attended wounded fight went 
evening told gregory month would took care able use arm 
next morning consultation cabin 
mr ferguson gone shore late previous afternoon five hundred sailors landed returned evening 
certain said nothing done place rebuilt 
sailors busy work fighting fire continued fresh outbreaks 
bulk natives left arabi marching opened prisons released convicts scum town still continue destruction whenever get chance 
score two caught red handed shot number others flogged 
another batch sailors land morning order soon restored unless arabi encamped ten thousand men two miles outside town makes effort recover place 
think likely european houses destroyed would longer reluctance bombard town even arabi recover would soon shelled 
way larger number people saved imagined 
several streets poor european quarters escaped 
people barricaded ends fought desperately assailants drew finding easier plunder better quarters 
even mob overcome resistance defenders lanes would found little worth taking five hundred europeans escaped useful 
charley beresford charge police arrangements shore gangs work fighting fire natives forced assist 
wires restored day two shall course telegraph instructions doubt mr partridge send orders rebuild soon order completely restored 
imagine us recalled home done 
even place intact business would done goods would little use navy army doubt army sent 
arabi powerful ever taken matter hand must carried 
rate clerks work done 
plans new building naturally prepared home foreman works sent 
bad job us must complain escaped lives hope six months may open 
however form plans receive instructions home 
gregory go ashore next week time order completely restored fires extinguished streets made least passable 
sailors aided battalion marines telegraphed malta admiral bombardment began 
khedive returned el teen partly destroyed soon blue jackets entered 
arrival put end difficulties henceforward operations carried nominally orders 
american ships entered harbor next day naval officer command landed one hundred twenty five men assist blue jackets two days later th regiment battalion th rifles arrived 
shops streets escaped destruction gradually reopened country people began bring supplies 
many refugees board ships sailed home found houses still standing although everything smashed destroyed set work make habitable 
soon temporary sheds erected portions cargoes board merchantmen would likely find sale landed 
end week mr ferguson received answer telegram 
three days previously received wire written fully 
letter came via marseilles 
congratulations escape staff mr partridge wrote say house warehouse entirely destroyed contents nothing clerks best return england 
make best arrangements 
plan ground already instructed architect prepare sketch rebuilding larger scale 
insurance companies sending agents verify claims 
looking last report seems loss goods well buildings fully covered 
staff determine remain alexandria take chance finding something authorized pay three months salary promise reinstate soon reopen 
anticipate disturbances whatever 
strong force sent doubt arabi crushed soon ready take field 
directions followed amplifications mentioned 
think annie gregory said ferguson read staff portion letter concerned 
shall take three months pay remain shall go back england think two lights look annie 
first would best us secondly shall like best course first difficult point decide 
see partridge say shall kept says best us 
think chance keeping us full pay 
intended would cheaper give us pay case would save passages back england 
think could reckon getting anything like full pay england know lost faith literary powers 
think improved certainly like last experience trust keeping us england 
question plenty openings men speak native language labor overseers 
contractors food army want men sort know several work port partridge house doubt could get employment way carry well till trade open obtain good deal better berth would offer 
doubt one could get employment transport commissariat army comes 
thing think seriously 
objections personal ones 
first place would lead nothing affair 
second place certain meet men knew harrow university since shrink 
gregory hilliard mind carrying parcel helping load dray like gregory hartley known sort thing 
personally feel smallest humiliation think would fair geoffrey 
like earl fellows knew able say brother knocking egypt interpreter mule driver something sort 
certainly taken consideration 
likely get sort berth officer would appointed every officer army whose regiment coming rushing war office apply sort appointment would enable come war 
almost certain business suppose last long get army fresh egyptian force raised 
may sure greater portion troops hurried back soon present egyptian army altogether smashed absolutely necessary force kind put stop mahdi fellow doings 
overrun half soudan inflicted serious defeats egyptian troops 
captured considerable portion kordofan course owing insurrection rows occurred red sea men fighting 
likely enough may appoint british officers new force might get fair position 
want interpreters 
promotion sure rapid might opportunities distinguishing get appointment could without discrediting take name 
among things might worst certain get sort post alexandria would enable us live without trenching upon three months pay offered could see nothing better could return partridge employment reopen doubt would improve position 
think parrott likely come back 
climate suit always attacks fever 
ferguson know told reported favourably work headquarters wounded defense house additional claim 
others course moved get junior clerkship advance way remuneration great improvement position 
think better accept three months pay take chances 
rate fear another disturbance alexandria 
mob lesson likely forget fancy although may withdraw army two three regiments left cairo long time come 
fools indeed threw away money business cost let egypt slip altogether fingers 
france forfeited right anything say matter 
hands valuable possession certainly stay would inestimable advantage natives govern egypt govern india away tyranny oppression extortion native officials 
mrs hilliard quite agreed husband accordingly next day gregory informed mr ferguson would accept three months pay discharge rate time remain alexandria 
think right hilliard 
lots opportunities man knows language 
like speak mr ross 
saw yesterday town said two assistants killed 
already obtained fresh contract heavy one supply meat troops arrive doubt would glad engage good terms though engagement could made stay army 
thank sir 
shall much obliged would rather engagement temporary one sides free leave days notice 
contractor chat gregory hilliard glad secure services 
saw advantage would gentleman represent army instead agent different kind

boy years acquainted family story except know name bore father christian name family 
grandfather must bad man mother quarreled father marrying 
well boy hardly understand extent exclusiveness englishmen 
course always people idea sons daughters marrying family less rank appears almost terrible thing 
told although daughter clergyman became orphan obliged go governess 
harm mother harm dear certain loss position 
father alive living country rectory grandfather might pleased father falling love would probably considered know photograph fine tall handsome man best education money could give might married much better say heiress property family influence might pushed would thought opposing marriage ground family 
governess different thing 
many cases lady every respect position doubtful one 
families treated one 
others position little different upper servant 
grandfather passionate man proud man 
father elder brother well provided two sisters father hoped would make good marriages 
lived good style uncle extravagant grandfather indulgent crippled good deal paying debts incurred 
natural therefore objected father engagement called penniless governess 
expected 
stated objections marriage calmly need quarrel 
father would assuredly married case grandfather might refused assist need breakup family took place 
however father resented tone merely difference opinion became serious quarrel never saw afterwards 
great grief owing unable earn living england father brought 
believe would done well home though would hard struggle 
time delicate ordered doctors go warm climate therefore father accepted position kind least enabled us live obtained benefit warm climate 
chance came going soudan certainty expedition succeeded everyone believed would would obtained permanent rank egyptian army recovered position life voluntarily given sake 
illness mother affection lungs dear 
constant cough threatened turn consumption one fatal diseases england 
cured mother often hear coughing night 
yes cough little troublesome late gregory 
indeed time disaster expedition hicks pasha annie hilliard lost ground 
conscious except sake boy troubled 
altogether given hope hope grew fainter fainter years went 
promise husband mention real name make application father unless absolutely assured death would gregory sake written mr hartley asked help would enabled take boy home england properly educated 
implicit faith binding promise made long driven absolute want apply mr hartley determined keep 
year conversation gregory sixteen 
tall strong time past anxious obtain employment would enable mother give teaching 
indeed obliged relinquish 
past months cheeks become hollow cough frequent day well night 
consulted english doctor saw paper staying shepherd hotel 
hesitated giving direct opinion imploring tell exact state health said gently afraid madam give hope recovery 
one lung already gone seriously diseased 
living england say life might prolonged taking warm climate change could made better 
thank doctor 
wanted know exact truth able make arrangements accordingly 
quite convinced condition hopeless thought right consult physician know much time could reckon 
tell always difficult mrs hilliard 
may three months hence 
might speedily vessel might give way lungs suddenly 
hand might live six months 
course say rapid progress disease 
may week doctor 
afraid hearing sentence indeed see eyes 
may within week doctor bowed head gravely may time 
thank said quietly 
sure could long 
teaching three weeks ago give last pupil 
breath short slightest exertion brings fit coughing 
return home said gregory dear boy must seen helped seeing time long 
seen english doctor today says end may come moment 
oh mother mother lad cried throwing knees burying face lap say news indeed come surprise 
months noticed steady change face fallen away hands seemed nerveless flesh transparent eyes grew larger larger 
many times walked far among hills beyond reach human eye thrown cried unrestrainedly strength seemed utterly exhausted yet verdict given seemed come sudden blow 
must break dear said quietly 
months felt sake care live 
thank god spared see growing could wish though liked see fairly started life feel may make way unaided 
want late give instructions 
desk find sealed envelope 
contains copy registers marriage birth 
prove father married son 
get plenty witnesses prove child mentioned 
promised father would mention real name anyone necessary write grandfather 
kept promise 
name gregory hilliard taken false names 
christian names 
third name family name find open envelope 
thinking months past best advice look upon order 
old enough think 
know sir herbert kitchener sirdar pushing way nile 
doubt knowledge arabic language used black race soudan able obtain sort post army perhaps interpreter one officers commanding brigade position fact father except army virtually british whereas went egyptian 
two reasons desiring 
wish go home position dispense aid family 
done without trust able 
like able go home one twenty say grandfather come home ask money assistance kind 
earning living honourably 
ask recognition family father son 
probable expedition last fully two years 
must gradual advance even khalifa beaten must considerable time matters thoroughly settled 
many civil posts open like well acquainted language country obtain one may well remain come age 
obtain months leave absence go england 
second reason although hope father still alive almost died possible like neufeld others prisoner khalifa hands possibly living arab cultivator near el obeid 
many prisoners taken may learn details battle may clear us darkness hangs father fate 
go home gregory best go first father brother 
address paper envelope 
heir peerage perhaps come 
reasons supposing sided father 
brothers bad friends although saw little father left oxford part away england year marriage time uncle america gone two three others hunting expedition among rocky mountains 
therefore reason supposing receive otherwise kindly sure nephew 
may indeed aught know made efforts discover father returned abroad 
would rather leave alone altogether mother gregory said passionately 
boy 
father anxious least recognized afterwards bear proper name 
going beggar nothing humiliating 
grandfather may even alive 
seldom see english newspaper even death advertised one papers hardly noticed never glance principal items news 
desk also see bank book 
name 
thought better stand save great deal trouble anything happen 
happily never reasons draw upon five hundred fifty pounds standing credit 
late generally paid money personally known manager 
difficulty made leaving everything 
sum keep obtain employment speak come age rate facilitate getting employment army obliged demand much pay take anything offers 
another reason going england grandfather may dead relented last towards father may left share fortune although might well refuse accept help alive hesitation taking right 
think sometimes boy wrong accepting fact father death proved taking home england believe acted best shrank thought going home beggar could maintain comfortably 
quite right mother dear 
happy looking forward time might work worked 
thousand times better living charity man looked upon cast father 
well believe least acted best dear sure best 
rate far happier could living england allowance begrudged 
week later gregory awakened cries negro servant running mrs hilliard bedroom found mother passed away night

dinner hour seven clock 
sure soon feel home 
gregory strolled camp 
troops little mud huts construction heat day much cooler tents 
sun getting low soudanese troops occupied cooking mending clothes sweeping streets rows huts light duties 
seemed gregory full fun life party schoolboys laughing joking playing practical tricks 
physique regiments splendid men averaging six feet height splendidly built 
regiments recruited among different tribes tall sturdy figures showed capable effort might called upon make 
one officers came tent passed 
new arrival think sir said 
white officers one spots fresh face 
yes arrived two three hours ago 
name hilliard 
attached regiment speak languages well general hunter going said make generally useful 
received commission days leaving cairo 
well come soda whisky 
heat frightful 
tell last news cairo going move 
shall happy come chat gregory said drink anything 
brought cairo accustomed heat find drinking makes one thirsty 
believe said especially liquid almost hot one one self 
sit box chairs luxuries indulge 
well heard anything move nothing officers spoken seem think soon begin 
good many came wady halfa stations river heard sufficiently recovered orders rejoin shortly 
yes suppose long 
course know nothing expect shall till order comes us start 
time year one expects move go pretty certain kitchener made mind dash forward 
see take abu hamed drive dervishes away push railway place soon done troops brought advance made berber farther cool season ever call cool season 
great force abu hamed nothing could stand moment 
chief force outside omdurman metemmeh mahmud khalifa favorite son 
see jaalin made fools 
instead waiting could lend hand revolted soon took dongola result mahmud came pretty well wiped 
defended stoutly metemmeh chance host brought 
town taken defenders two three thousand fighting men massacred together women children 
accounts brought us men got away must even horrible business usual dervishes past masters art massacre 
however think course nearly 
late good many fugitives kordofan arrived say general revolt hear given dervishes heavy thrashing 
think great fight likely take place gregory asked 
side metemmeh 
except abu hamed hear strong dervish force omdurman 
mahmud thinks strong enough doubt fight khalifa know business fall back forces omdurman fight one big battle 
two armies together hear amount sixty seventy thousand doubt whatever faults beggars fight 
tough affair believe shall british troops help final advance 
depend soudanese egyptians fight hard enough 
odds would heavy sirdar man risk failure 
couple brigades british infantry doubt result fancy beat one big fight mahdism 
poor beggars tribesmen regard dervishes invincible put long tyranny 
rising jaalin news get kordofan show moment hear dervishes beaten khartoum hands general rising dervishes pretty well exterminated 
hope mahmud fight beat khalifa lot may lose heart retire get omdurman away tremendous business trying follow confront us 
got river railway land carriage army might keep falling back great lakes anything could overtake 
hope mahmud retire omdurman without fighting host khalifa would would certain give battle abandoning capital 
fine looking fellows blacks gregory said 
splendid fellows love fighting fighting sake 
opinion worthy occupation man shown worthy fight side men 
perfect confidence us would believe go anywhere led 
say never afraid like english 
seem good many women camps 
yes women follow wherever go 
cook generally look 
warlike husbands encourage go battle applause curious quavering cries 
men get little pay provided rations draw certain amount women costs next nothing fancy wives pays well 
believe would rather killed come back face reproaches 
could wish cheery better fellows 
never grumble always merry really seem tireless 
practically give trouble whatever good see brighten chance fight 
hope shall see long gregory said 
must going change put mess uniform dinner 
rather nervous accustomed dine generals 
find pleasant said 
hunter splendid fellow adored men 
staff comparatively young men none stiffness british staff officer 
young scarcely man rank captain british army 
majors colonels egyptian army us subalterns regiments 
good training us 
home subaltern merely machine carry orders told think would heinous offence 
altogether without responsibility without initiative time becomes field officer hidebound 
never thought expected begin working twenty years like machine 
see ever big war weak point 
wars like little wars india men learn think take responsibility know general officers would get training 
well must going 
goodbye shall often meet 
us always running 
ask dine us days 
doubt would like get accustomed headquarters mess first 
course hunter brigade staff dine together little regimental messes among prefer 
three four us one sit one shirt sleeves whereas brigade mess one must course turn uniform climate stifling 
meal pleasant one gregory anticipated 
board steamer course dined officers found little difference 
ten sat including principal medical officer captain head station intelligence department major wingate present wady halfa 
except roughness surroundings like regimental mess presence general commanding way acted damper conversation 
general hunter sitting introduced members pleasant words put ease 
gregory way learned good deal officers cairo health able say convalescent sailed point sailing england 
table formed two long benches constructed engineers 
laid large tent walls removed give free passage air 
although scarcely standard mess dinner home means bad one consisting soup fish river joint beef one end mutton curried kidneys sweet omelettes cheese whisky water soda drink dinner meal four bottles claret placed table cigars pipes lit 
half hour later four party sat whist rest going outside tent sat threw sand smoked chatted till time turn 
gregory first step next morning buy horse 
purchased fugitives come kordofan 
good animal though poor condition would soon pick flesh well attended fed 
accustom riding gregory went couple hours every morning getting daybreak take exercise work day began 
also followed example officers egyptian regiments purchased camel conveyance baggage 
find great advantage one said 
course times may arrive leave behind rule trouble 
hire native driver costs practically nothing keeps baggage 
one asks questions halt day two comforts 
course british regiment cut last ounce us altogether different 
three four white officers regiment extra camels train make appreciable difference 
besides black fellows consider quite natural proper white officers fare different way whereas british tommy would inclined grumble saw officers enjoying luxuries rough 
horse cost three pounds camel five gregory store money seriously affected purchases 
animals although poor condition journey kordofan fortnight rest good feeding wonders 
zaki much gregory well satisfied selection made 
looked groomed horse saw native camel took care went regularly river water every evening horse 
always jug cold tea ready gregory whenever came floor tent kept scrupulously clean 
zaki regret could master consoled told time would soon come would actively engaged 
first day arrival gregory kept fully employed 
sometimes assisted officer intelligence department interviewing fugitives arrived berber points river kordofan villages white nile 
sometimes carried messages general officers command two egyptian brigades 
listen disputes natives returning homes driven dervishes found possession land 
took notes arguments sides submitted general decision 
work would trifling climate exhausting sweltering heat day sorry sun sank could take khaki tunic go river swim 
one evening sitting dinner general hunter said annoying natives making way country able tell us good deal taking place nile omdurman metemmeh also get news state things berber abu hamed know nothing whatever mahmud intentions indeed anything metemmeh since captured dervishes heard whole population destroyed 
course mahmud choice three courses 
stay march whole force berber advance us 
suppose idea progress railway making wady halfa 
may heard doubt heard making road sort across desert direction abu hamed capabilities railway form idea may well believe march army across practically waterless desert matter impossibility 
hand knows gathering considerable force limited knowledge doubtless supposes going cross bayuda desert metemmeh gordon relief column coming way intend follow river bank berber 
unquestionably best course considers may sure force command strong enough crush us would push across desert fall upon us reinforcements arrive 
reported believe truly khalifa father positively refused let still sons disobeyed fathers 
true difficulty water serious case dervish force us 
first place march twice far 
second place accustomed go long time without water little affected heat 
lastly nothing carry except weapons handfuls dates water gourds 
still know forces one another arrived greatly weakened journey 
however mahmud may attempt must know spies present land transport would required intending advance across desert 
may therefore move least portion force berber trusting fact even make advance south intention cutting retreat khartoum would able reach metemmeh could get 
undoubtedly british general commanding force constituted mahmud would make dash across desert fall upon us unless indeed felt certain difficulties encountered last time attempted take desert route certain advance river step step continuing policy followed since began push forward assouan 
mahmud difficult position 
controlled father khartoum 
among many important emirs men almost equal rank could hardly hope whatever decision might personally arrive would generally accepted opposed would force could declare making movement acting opposition father orders 
however total ignorance mahmud plans intentions unfortunate hardly helped naturally natives coming kordofan give metemmeh wide berth 
sending natives find going question would detected language different baggara 
later general retired quarters 
gregory went 
speak minutes sir asked 
certainly mr hilliard 
thinking saying regarding information mahmud intentions 
permission ready undertake go camp find general opinion plans 
impossible mr hilliard admire courage making offer would going certain death 
think sir 
talk baggara better negro dialect passes 
among baggara likely learn something father fate old nurse learned languages long time among tribe devoted mother request time teaching arab dialect convinced could pass unsuspected among far language concerned 
great difference arab features european think stained brown head partly shaved according fashion little fear detected 
costume easy enough 
seen dervishes yet natives come el obeid neighborhood masters could give account dress way wear patches clothes distinguishing mark mahdists 
could tell 
could officers 
dress differs little ordinary arab costume 
nearly wear loose white trousers coming ankles 
cases usual baggy eastern articles others legs separate 
almost wear white garment coming knee course sash round waist sleeves reaching elbow inch two 
wear turbans majority simply skullcaps 
could get dress made three four hours 
risk altogether great think justified allowing undertake 
really think great danger sir 
great object gained would different view great importance said evening learning mahmud intentions risk one life lost even great nothing 
say sirdar plans might greatly affected course mahmud adopts case life subaltern like matter scarcely considered 
childhood preparing go among dervishes propose soon khartoum recaptured 
therefore sir anticipating work months possibly year render service army would gladly undertake give permission 
general minute two silent 
well hilliard said last thinking put know justified refusing offer 
gallant one may possibly meet success 
thank sir shall really glad enter upon work looked forward 
although may direct bearing upon discovery father fate start direction 
think better go mounted foot say certainly horseback occasion hasty determination 
every step carefully considered far possible foresee provide every emergency may arise 
think well 
time tomorrow discuss 
gregory went straight back hut 
come zaki want speak 
light lamp shut door 
sit 
know country metemmeh yes master traveled father six years ago

first place scarcely speak arabic second would see features one jaalin

sometimes parties ride gakdul even passed till within sight camp found wells still unoccupied army quiet go back 
go horseback zaki shall want someone act guide look horse mine place near river find hiding place away dervish camp 
would take lord zaki said quickly

wish travel person could ride attended slave 
people might say man come one knows man rides slave great object enter camp quietly one left half hour

zaki nodded 
would good tale lord men escaped el obeid come said khalifa troops called join omdurman necessary keep strong force many tribes province would rise rebellion chance 
therefore would likely meet anyone el obeid mahmud camp 
zaki many soudan suffered hands dervishes remain quiet supply largest part khalifa army lord none trust others 
madness one tribe rise jaalin metemmeh 
dervishes wiped face earth 
many follow see allah always given victory mahdists therefore mahdi must prophet 
others join army villages destroyed fields wasted see way saving starvation 
many fight fond fighting 
see gladly take service fight countrymen although christians 
suppose conquer khalifa tomorrow half army would enlist service would take 
man would contented till fields could peace quiet fears may see produce eaten others house set fire would rather leave home fight cares 
mahdist army badly fed badly paid 
scarce keep life together

character scenery completely changed miles winding along foot jebel el jilif hills 
steep precipitous spurs intermediate valleys 
wells differed entirely hambok merely holes dug sand water brought one skin bags brought poured shallow cisterns made surface 
gakdul wells large pools rock foot one spurs hill two miles line caravan route

stay till evening move three miles farther may handy leave dervishes hurry 
could go camp lord would much better respects could see speak arabic 
master could say carried slave boy 
see speak little arabic could understand simple orders slave boy would eight ten years among arabs 
would certainly great advantage horses handy 
however first go join dervishes see encamp 
doubt good deal scattered could find quiet spot mounted men taken station would join 
would necessary find whether came kordofan villages white nile 
would never stumble party el obeid 
remained quiet day 
wood extended hundred fifty yards back river little fear anyone coming omdurman would enter within sight metemmeh 
dusk rode judged within two miles town entering clump high bushes river halted night 
chapter among dervishes 
morning gregory started alone soon light 
neared town saw several native craft river boats passing fro town shendy opposite bank 
water side number men carrying appeared bags grain towards hills behind town others straggling towards river 
without questioned gregory entered metemmeh stopped minutes 
everywhere bodies men women children donkeys animals 
shrivelled dried sun stench almost unbearable glad hurry away 
beyond walls made hill 
many tents could seen great numbers men moving 
felt sure among many one would notice newcomer moving among throng soon sat among number dervishes eating morning meal 
taking dates bag munched quietly 
talk going soon perceived considerable amount discontent long delay 
men favor moving berber ground would least fare better majority eager march north drive infidels merawi dongola 
mahmud would sure one said could march without provisions said mahmud asked sufficient supply cross bayuda promised drive infidels assouan khalifa says would better wait till come strong body exterminate 
fight sent would better stay omdurman plenty food ran short could march villages take wanted 
course khalifa knows best us seems strange indeed 
general chorus assent 
listening time gregory rose passing ridge came upon main camp 
number emirs sheiks banners flying entrance tents 
whole ground thickly dotted little shelters formed bushes dark blankets thrown keep rays sun 
everywhere women seated standing talking others engaged cooking 
children played boys came loaded faggots gone long distances cut 
places numbers horses picketed showing baggara cavalry stationed 
neighborhood emirs tents sort attempt order arrangement little shelters showing men tribes encamped 
beyond straggling distance small encampments men still erecting shelters bushes women boys brought 
evidently fresh arrivals squatted soon came either ignorance friends encamped preference quiet situation 
fringe new arrivals extended along whole semicircle camp several small parties came gregory wandered saw notice taken already established thought could bring zaki horses without fear close questioning 
therefore walked spot left mounting rode camp making wide sweep avoid front facing metemmeh 
could camp equally well anywhere zaki may well go round extreme left ride suddenly shall least start nearest point line came 
small clump bushes hundred yards nearest little shelters 
dismounted began knives cut bushes form screen sun 
watered horses left river also filled water skins 
think could find better place zaki gregory said completed shelter thrown blankets lay shade 
doubt shall soon joined others first comers spot us ask questions make enquiries us 
shall go camp soon heat abates people begin move 
remember story carried jaalin village raid 
master small sheik force el obeid 
companion son latter made mind come fight master gave freedom might fight son side 
might say yet settled whose banner shall fight 
wish front battle meet infidels 
quite sufficient 
men almost every village soudan one care much neighbors come 
mention intend fight matchlock men horseback animals greatly fatigued long journey require rest time far home fear might lose went fight case might journey foot long time could get others 
suppose necessary say 
people much occupied affairs care much others still well hesitate questioned 
talk laughter great camp ceased sun lost power began 
gregory move till began get dusk 
shall away time said uneasy 
shall take black blanket cover lie asleep close emirs tents hear talk going may able gather idea views 
already learned tribesmen heard immediate move discontented kept inactive long 
leaders however may plans make known men time action 
camp thoroughly alive entered 
men sitting groups women keeping near little shelters laughing chatting together sometimes quarrelling 
manner men either sat walked difficult gregory distinguish villagers dragged away homes forced enter service khalifa baggara kindred tribes long held soudan subjection 
former quiet demeanor sometimes sullen looks 
doubt fighting came would face death hands infidels bravely oppressors belief mahdism universal 
followers proved invincible doubt would destroy armies egypt resented dragged away quiet homes families fields 
among baggara strode haughtily 
splendid men part tall lithe muscular men supreme belief cause carrying norman barons might done among crowd saxons conquerors land trusted followers successor mahdi men felt invincible 
true far failed overrun egypt even suffered reverses khalifa taught consider due disobedience orders result fighting upon unlucky days 
soon reversed 
prophecies told infidels annihilated would sweep without opposition possess plunder egypt 
gregory passed wholly unnoticed among crowd 
nothing distinguish others thought egyptian spy still less one infidels venture camp never occurred one multitude 
occasionally sat near group baggara listening talk 
impatient convinced best allah would destroy enemy 
still expressions impatience mahmud allowed advance 
know one said kirkeban last great destruction infidel take place madmen coming fate still might move destroy dongola along river possess arms stores 
come thus far omdurman go farther ask questions another said contemptuously 
enough command khalifa power knowledge given mahdi returns earth 
khalifa revealed day hour smite infidel 
mahmud great emirs content wait impatient everywhere gregory went heard feelings expressed 
men impatient must wait appointed hour 
late ventured approach tents leaders 
knew impossible get near mahmud bodyguard picked men 
night however dark enveloping head foot black blanket crawled well beyond line tents cautiously made way towards 
knew see white figures dervishes could make managed unnoticed crawl one largest tents lie 
heard chatter women adjoining tent sound lay 
hour quiet 
saw two white figures coming mahmud camp lay fifty yards away 
delight stopped entrance tent concealed one said well understand ibrahim khalim brother mahmud sorely vexed father let advance egyptians merawi 
fully share feelings could cavalry sweep river even though footmen came according accounts two three thousand strong many horsemen command 
osman azrakyet 
methinks father right 
march across desert would lose many men great numbers animals arrive weakened dispirited 
remain egyptians bear hardships march across desert 
great numbers animals carry baggage food without poor infidels unable march would die weakened force would easy prey us 
true said may come came dongola boats 
cataracts ascend rapid currents nile full struggle 
strong force abu hamed governor berber move force hears egyptians coming cataracts 
allah pass reach berber shall know meet 
mahmud settled evening many strong forts built river bank infidels try advance farther water sunk 
agree mahmud wish otherwise could hurl upon egyptians prevent coming farther would partial success 
wait gather forces come shall destroy one blow 
shall seize stores animals cross desert dongola march forward assouan wait till khalifa brings army oppose us conquer land infidel 
eager day battle seems best wait infidels come feel wise khalifa thus order 
tent

evening came steamer tied island miles north shendy 
far seen hostile parties indeed country wholly deserted 
next morning started daybreak 
shendy seemed ruins 
two arabs seen bank 
shots fired town reply 
half hour later metemmeh seen 
stood half mile river 
along bank seven mud forts extremely thick solid walls 
keeping near opposite bank gunboats led zafir made way river 
dervish horsemen could seen riding fort fort doubtless carrying orders 
river four thousand yards wide distance gunboats opened fire two nearest forts 
range soon obtained nicety white sergeants native gunners made splendid practice every shell bursting upon forts maxims speedily sent dervish horsemen galloping distant hills could made large camp 
dervish gunners replied promptly range great old brass guns 
shot fell short though fired great elevation fell beyond boats 
one shell however struck zafir passing deck killing soudanese shrapnel shell burst fatteh 
hour fire range gunboats moved opposite position opened fire shell shrapnel committing terrible havoc forts whose fire presently slackened suddenly 
explained fact gunboats passed saw embrasures forts commanded approach north past enemy unable bring gun bear upon boats 
doubtless dervishes considered impossible steamer pass fire therefore unnecessary widen embrasures guns could fire upon facing forts going beyond 
suddenly board watching effect fire outburst musketry broke bushes lined eastern bank hundred yards away 
fortunately greater part bullets flew overhead many rattled side 
maxims instantly turned upon unseen enemy soudanese fired volleys rash assailants went thicker bush many dropping gained 
gunboats steamed slowly river turning retired downstream shelling enemy position passed 
going came upon number dervishes busy unloading half dozen native craft 
maxim soon sent flying boats contained horses donkeys grain goods taken tow gunboats anchored island previous night 
well bimbashi captain keppel said work day first brush enemy 
think would rather call bimbashi captain keppel 
title ridiculous given might useful egyptian soudanese soldiers 
feel really obliged would simply call hilliard 
felt right sir fight except envied gunners something nothing look 
certainly made jump shell struck boat quite made mind guns would carry far complete surprise 
yes harmless affair 
still good preparation something severe 
got accustomed noise always great trial nerves actual danger 
wish could something sir 
everyone else duty black firemen even servant made useful carrying shot 
tell mr hilliard 
get marine sergeants instruct working maxim duties men attending 
next time come put command one 
duties severe would simply direct men object aim watch effect direction bullets see change aim circumstances may direct 
black gunners well trained know work still chance gun jams useful able show even though know well better 
blacks like commanded white officer feel pleased rather otherwise appointed command gun 
lessons begin day two done metemmeh yet 
much obliged indeed gregory said warmly 
take care interfere men working gun 
word two commendation make good practice pleases immensely work better faster standing 
daybreak next morning gunboats went engaged forts 
dervishes placed guns position shells fell short boats played havoc enemy defences 
ten thousand dervish horse foot came near town readiness repel attempt landing 
hours bombardment gunboats retired 
steamed away dervish host shouting waving banners evidently considering great victory 
fulfilled object retain mahmud metemmeh showing advanced merawi dongola power occupy town cut retreat prevent reinforcements stores reaching omdurman gunboats returned berber

shortly passing town large dervish camp seen valley afterwards found occupied force returned berber 
heavy fire shell shrapnel opened upon speedily destroyed 
gunboats went high sixth cataract 
country found absolutely deserted neither peasant dervish visible 
thus accomplished object reconnaissance flotilla returned exchanged fire metemmeh batteries kept way berber 
chapter prisoner 
rather remain unoccupied board gunboat gregory went colonel wingate headquarters said glad would allow flotilla remained berber assist interrogating fugitives arrived south spies employed gain early information intentions movements enemy 
position dervishes metemmeh becoming critical 
khalifa desirous mahmud return force omdurman take part battle convinced invaders would annihilated 
mahmud eager impetuous disposition anxious take offensive either march upon merawi dongola drive british berber 
could doubt view sagacious one father best tactics adopted harass british advance fall upon convoys cut communications oblige fall back want supplies 
khalifa mistake similar made theodore abyssinia koffee kalkalli ashanti 
either leaders adopted system harassing invaders moment left coast would next impossible latter arrive destination 
allowed march unmolested within striking distance hazarded everything fortune single battle lost 
mahmud made movement obedience khalifa orders retire omdurman latter thereupon refused send supplies mahmud army therefore obliged rely upon raids plunder subsistence 
raids carried great boldness villages situated within miles berber attacked 
dervishes however met much warmer reception expected rifles ammunition served freely villagers knowing fate awaited dervishes victorious offered obstinate resistance latter fell back discomfited 
early january sirdar learned khalifa changed mind sent peremptory orders mahmud advance drive british berber destroy railway 
mahmud joined osman digna five thousand men egyptian troops well fought never yet opposed formidable force mahmud commanded sirdar telegraphed england white troops

mahmud remained metemmeh could aided forts artillery walled town offered formidable resistance 
marched along banks nile would exposed fire gunboats could arrested course 
country round berber favourable action cavalry defeated could fallen back unmolested metemmeh omdurman crossing river practically cut dervish base desert behind taken kassala italians egyptian battalion large force friendly arabs would prevent retiring banks atbara 
mahmud plan march along nile ahab cross desert hudi angle river whence direct march twenty five miles would take berber way would avoid strong position junction atbara nile 
would easy gunboats prevent mahmud crossing nile sirdar glad allow 
movement afforded time concentrate force get large supplies 
day distance could transported railway increased saw time fighting came victory would decisive one indeed mahmud men would ever able make way omdurman swell khalifa force 
one occasion however gunboats went watch going take advantage opportunity might offer destroy mahmud boats thus render work getting force slower difficult 
entrenchment thrown point dervishes crossed manned two hundred fifty riflemen 
zafir steamed close bank opened fire maxims 
another gunboat sank one large craft captured two others troops landed covered fire guns captured fourth grounded shallow water 
smaller boat halfway across river gunboats arrived 
seen several women board capture would value regard paid

passing thirty yards astern gunboat badly aimed shell dervish battery struck sank almost instantly 
gregory superintending working maxim nearest stern looked round sound explosion

thinking lord zaki said would well go boat far dongola 
village many miles place many people fled doubtless return villages plant fields longer fear dervishes 
rate certain meet friends dongola 
well get order altered 
difficulty 
shall glad know home go war quite 
shall never go long lord keep zaki said fervently 
certainly shall part zaki long remain country probably long time 
next day zaki aided carrying sisters goods river bank saw board one native craft carried also fifteen twenty fugitives 
mr hilliard general hunter said morning devote object came 
unquestionably must many among prisoners fought el obeid 
may gather particulars battle lips 
greater portion white troops march country 
course know plans may unless good reason contrary certainly advise retain position egyptian army 
great deal work done matters quite settled civil administration sort course formed would certainly obtain far better post could hope get home 
quite made mind sir 
certainly left cairo idea remaining permanently service exceptionally fortunate owing largely kindness seriously thinking matter quite determined obtain appointment remain 
ties whatever either lower egypt england way earning living possibly begun early may rest time doubt become important branch egyptian administration 
glad hear take view 
grumble soudan yet us would sorry leave doubt whatever administration time become magnificently rich fertile province 
relieved duty present gregory went great yard near mosque called praying square majority dervish prisoners confined 
addressing man five forty years asked arabic whether many among prisoners fought hicks el obeid 
man hesitated 
asking part sirdar gregory said may sure punishment inflicted fought us thought punishment thing happened many years ago 
father believe one english officers killed spoke arabic well possible killed like slatin neufeld kept slave case might useful 
many fought hicks native said 
fought nearly baggara old also 
never heard white man escaped death 
broke square english general officers charged middle us fell 
close time saw bodies hour afterwards 
father fighting officer 
interpreter may near others 
attack people made heard one soudanese regiments held together marched away white officer 

two days afterwards surrounded 
fought hard last lost many men offered would surrender become mahdi men would spared 
tribesmen taken atbara taken service 
white officer became say native said 
memory 
may fallen surrendered say certainly remember white man killed 
ask others tomorrow tell say 
busy day omdurman 
army made efforts achieved great triumph marched military order bands playing town 
sirdar double motive ordering 
first place legitimate triumph troops thus march conquerors town 
second place sight would impress inhabitants dervish prisoners sense power henceforth would masters undoubtedly show desired effect 
orderly ranks swept along proud demeanor men physique equipment created profound impression among natives 
half kinsmen many fought khalifa aided defeating 
accomplished drill discipline influence white officers 
soudanese evidently well fed cared even haughty baggara held heads high 
especially admired artillery battery following battery perfect order 
guns carried death ranks dervishes whose fire even fanatical bravery followers khalifa unable stand 
march past concluded scarce one prisoners would gladly enlisted 
following day gregory went praying square 
man morning seen came 
enquired many el obeid lord said 
say white man camp black battalion surrendered though one seen fighting going 
body one found fight taken place previous day 
matter talk among dervishes time lain circle round enemy convinced one passed lines 
surrendered said taken command exposed hottest fire encouraged telling bravely defended likely obtain favourable terms 
night advised accept offer dervishes might make following morning missing none could give account become 
tale told spoken 
story made profound impression upon gregory 
seemed possible father remembrance might sole white survivor hicks army 
true nothing prove white man joined black battalion escaped first day massacre 
non combatants vizitelly artist illustrated london news donovan correspondent daily news 
either might also portion square attack commenced unable join hicks officers final charge midst enemy 
still least possible father man retired field black battalion afterwards strangely disappeared 
become years made disguise murdered wandering bands concealed months hut friendly tribesman since killed trying make way enslaved still lingering wretched existence could hardly hope fallen friendly hands alive would surely managed knowledge country make way reach khartoum still held egyptians 
rate gregory concluded might find whether european arrived siege 
went river took native boat across khartoum 
ceremony sunday many natives watched arrival flotilla might gordon time 
great hopes chance 
flags still flying governor house landed detachment egyptian troops stationed 
native officer came landed 
come across question natives said 
believe still living 
oh yes bimbashi good many scattered among ruins 
come bringing fruit fish sale 
think mostly live riverside 
gregory kept till came huts occupied fishermen men cultivated small plots ground 
found several lived khartoum captured escaped general massacre hiding till nightfall making way river boats 
none could give information sought one suggested likely hear greeks turks worked khalifa arsenal foundries spared services would able render mahdi 
returning omdurman went machine shop 
work already resumed repairs needed several gunboats 
went foreman man sixty years age 
engaged city siege said arabic knew foreman must thoroughly acquainted 
yes sir ten years 
anxious learn whether white man survived battle el obeid ever reached town capture 
man thought time 
yes said white man certainly came towards end siege 
know happened meet going home work asked way governor known white man native attire black exposure sun arabs 
gave directions ask questions said afterwards one hicks officers 
later heard went steamer colonel stewart 
hear name gregory asked anxiously 
sir 
talk arabic well extremely well 
much better time 
remember long arrived steamer started long sir though really tell long 
cut suppose certainly say long 
one else would know sir think 
ask 
called workmen 
knew white officer hicks pasha army said returned 
one remembered come gordon see repairs required engines steamer never heard name could recall personal appearance except seemed man thirty 
remembered seeing board stewart steamer working engines started 
thanking foreman gregory returned hut two officers hunter staff taken quarters 
profoundly depressed 
white man might well father even certain fallen 
knew fate stewart steamer remains seen hebbeh 
colonel accepted invitation treacherous sheik village massacred 
would least go endeavor learn natives particulars fate board whether possible whites could escaped 
sitting time thought went general hunter quarters asked see 
general listened sympathetically story 
never moment thought father could escaped said tell possible perish afterwards 
well understand learned much anxious hear 
certainly grant request leave go hebbeh 
know place taken destroyed river column earle rather brackenbury earle killed fight kirkeban 
numerous relics found massacre journal stewart known kept among 
would doubt mentioned survivor hicks army coming river 
place deserted brackenbury arrived 
certainly came 
since inhabitants probably returned may know places plunder hidden away approach brackenbury column 
doubt offer reward would lead production 
may absent long 
british regiments go several steamers start tomorrow 
give order go 
difficulty getting back sirdar already decided railway carried atbara khartoum believe telegraphed morning material stores sent 
doubt brought rail grain large quantities required use troops population town come water 
doubt quickest way back ride abu hamed take train atbara 
back soon general 
much obliged letting go 
tell sirdar given leave 
absolutely necessary always well one name kept front 
next day gregory saw general 
mentioned sirdar wanted fortnight leave told 
simply nodded said let month wants 
things think morning small dervish steamer came white nile 
khalifa flag flying heard taken place till one gunboats ran alongside 
course surrendered 
curious story told 
left omdurman month ago sapphire carried five hundred men 
object voyage collect grain 
reached old station fashoda fired upon black troops white men among strange flag flying 
firing pretty accurate forty men killed wounded emir command disembarked encamped troops sapphire opposite bank sent small steamer back ask khalifa orders 
story seemed strange improbable went sirdar boat brought alongside 
doubt peppered balls 
general staff cut one bullets woodwork fully confirmed story 
leaden balls bits old iron conical nickel bullets 
could fired small bore rifles certainly white men fashoda 
course one form opinion come 
may belgians congo 
may improbable expeditionary party italians 
italy withdrawing pushing forward think question concerned matter 
question seems lie belgians french unless expedition sent possessions great lakes 
dervishes steamer say flag like ignorance color profound give sorts contradictory statements 
anyhow serious matter 
certainly foreign power right send expedition nile certainly one government would allow remain beyond question fashoda egyptian station within egyptian territory present much say foreign power established would occupying country 
seems extraordinary proceeding sir 
extraordinary 
seems thing absolutely done would seem improbable foreign power could take extraordinary unjustifiable course 
lucky whoever smashed dervishes would made short work nation sent would probably never known fate 
chapter voice dead 
afternoon gregory heard orders issued five gunboats start river first thing morning sirdar going take five hundred men th soudanese 
order also issued correspondents leave next day cairo 
gregory met one evening 
hear mr pearson yes sort option given us really choice 
might go instantly must stay till last white troops gone 
may long time saying may come fashoda business 
besides khalifa fairly escaped sixty thousand men thirty thousand got may yet rally round another two three months may head large force ever 
think way egyptians fought day need white troops back 
still likely battalion two may left 
however practically choose going waiting least month may sure censorship would put round turn allowed say word fashoda business would thing worth telegraphing 
voted going 
course understand pressure put upon us account curious affair fashoda 
fortunately none us sorry 
certain pause time one want kicking one heels ghastly town though rather sharp peremptory work say think sirdar wrong 
whoever men may must go certain course somewhat delicate business france frenchmen sure immensely sore business certainly desirable nothing written could increase feeling 
doubt sirdar telegraphed home instructions soon got news affair imagine going morning five gunboats proof already received instructions sort 
hope force french 
feeling us tremendously strong france certainly like backing fight big talk think ready risk war us especially though occupation fashoda would immense annoyance us would possible utility

handed ten dollars native thrust packet breast pocket walked slowly river 
never entertained hope finding father evidence death gave shock 
mother right 
always insisted possibility might escaped massacre el obeid 
done 
reached khartoum 
started full hope seeing wife child treacherously massacred 
would read message grave 
must reserved time alone 
knew enough able guess details could otherwise painful 
felt almost glad mother alive 
loss scarcely real one 
father left infant 
although mother often spoken scarcely reality gregory became old enough comprehend matter seemed certain father must killed 
could hardly understand mother could cling hope 
father real character since started cairo ever 
knew desert fierce inhabitants 
could picture battle since fight omdurman able see wild rush egyptian square mad confusion charge handful white officers one white man going black battalion held together 
shock know father died vastly greater would mother pictured dying suddenly fighting last scarce conscious pain till received fatal wound 
said gregory better think father died thus lingering hopeless slavery like neufeld would agony know suffer two years struggled dangers khartoum way back full hope love treacherously murdered 
village sheik met went 
found nothing lord nothing old papers said 
report well us hope great english commander shall certainly tell power aid 
walked towards river 
one men gone speaking sheik ran back meet 
steamer coming river lord 
fortunate indeed gregory exclaimed 
intended sleep tonight bargain sheik donkeys camels take us back 
save two days 
two three native craft fastened shore waiting breeze set strong enough take 
gregory arranged one put party board steamer boat 
quarter hour gunboat approached rowed meet 
came gregory stood shouted throw rope 
done officer came side 
want passage five men abu hamed 
officer general hunter staff 
pleasure 
come front asked gregory stepped board five blacks 
yes 
tell great fight 
heard dongola beyond fact thrashed khalifa taken omdurman received particulars 
begin drink 
horribly annoying went sat awning steward brought tumblers soda water whisky two lemons 
gregory refused whisky took lemon cold water 
horrible nuisance officer went 
one gordon old steamers broken twice 
still console thinking even time likely would taken 
hope however work yet 
see got three native craft tow much get cataract 
please tell battle 
gregory gave outline struggle occupation omdurman might called funeral service gordon khartoum 
dark story finished 
way officer said sit dinner deck ask men 
must order food given 
plenty gregory said 
brought enough week 
thought might detained two three days obliged make journey land abu hamed 
asked way place long 
landed morning 
came search relics 
father board stewart steamer would nothing omdurman days got leave run 
fortunate securing boat abu hamed arrival equally picked shall away omdurman seven days equal luck getting steamer atbara 
think shall disappointed white troops coming stores going egyptian brigade certain kept many hours 
sirdar gone fashoda suppose got leave 
yes 
heard merawi officer command foreign troops arrived 
suppose nothing known news probably come another fortnight perhaps longer 
general idea french 
french party congo states 
tremendous cheek whoever officer said 
precious lucky given khalifa something else think may sure would wiped pretty quickly unless strong force seem probable 
hear sirdar taken regiment 
yes suppose actual move made present 
suppose diplomatic business 
still think would go 
one doubt omdurman gregory said 
expense trouble retake soudan likely let anyone else plant road great lakes 
abu hamed sir shall five clock rate think may safely reckon catching morning train 
goes think eight 
sure catch train soon orders sent railway materials shall sent quickly possible decided railway shall carried khartoum 
expect soon nile falls make temporary bridge across atbara 
six morning steamer arrived abu hamed 
gregory landed paid four men went little station hour later way atbara fort 
two hours wait reached omdurman three clock following afternoon 
landed met officer knew 
news asked 
nothing fashoda talked 
ascertained force undoubtedly french 
betting even whether france back 
made difficult outburst enthusiasm considered defeat england 
well course go much except makes harder government give 
news received whereabouts khalifa 
broadwood two regiments egyptian cavalry camel corps started pursuit khalifa osman hour found got away 
slatin pasha went 
horses work day stop half past eight 
could get water bivouacked halted

thirty five miles omdurman 
one gunboats gone supplies owing nile overflowed could get near enough land 
next morning got news khalifa twenty five miles ahead obtained fresh camels ordered return town 
picked good many fugitives among khalifa favorite wife doubtless women slipped away one halting places feeling unable bear constant fatigues hardships flight desert 
cavalry since beyond fact khalifa joined many fugitives battle making kordofan certain news obtained 
present nothing done direction 
horse bought right 
really like taking already one looked almost like robbery giving two pounds saddle 
others done well officer laughed 
one brigade staff bought horse pound burleigh given forty cairo 
help 
could take horses 
besides loss 
newspapers afford pay 
must coining money late 
reconciles gregory laughed 
think correspondents expenses paid papers 
know anything arrangements stands reason must campaign like 
ordinary war man calculate outlay might expedition kind one could foretell expenses might incur 
besides sirdar saved newspapers enormous expenditure 
correspondents rigidly kept messages hundred words whereas way would sent columns 
course correspondents grumbled doubt employers well pleased newspapers must saved thousands pounds restriction 
back sooner expected general hunter said gregory went reported arrival 
scarce week since left 
week sir 
everything went smoothly three four hours hebbeh 
succeed search yes sir 
fortunately found man hidden pocketbook taken body one white men murdered 
nothing old papers brackenbury expedition approached hidden away give thought enquired knew papers things connected board steamer 
took place hidden great stone turned notebook journals father thought possible white man arrived khartoum short time place captured dervishes gone steamer carried colonel stewart 
well hilliard general said kindly even certain knowledge death better fear might slavery 
told remembrance none sir course mother talked often several photographs last taken cairo left almost seem known 
however feel relief know feared remotely possible slave among baggara 
think hard gone two years trials sufferings murdered way home 
doubt 
read father diary yet sir heart shall put shock given passed away 
feel little hard work best thing 
chance returned time 
going blue nile tomorrow morning clear villages doubt full fugitives 
glad come back 
speaking today general rundle command 
one objects expedition prevent fadil crossing river 
advancing gedareh head ten thousand troops join khalifa forty miles away day took place received news victory fell back 
cross bring formidable reinforcement khalifa 
know colonel parsons started kassala th object capture gedareh absence fadil 
cross atbara el fasher march bank river till nearest point gedareh 
probable strike across th th 
force comparatively small know large garrison fadil left 
altogether uneasy expedition 
desirable parsons know fadil retiring far learn natives yet crossed blue nile 
gedareh said strong place parsons might hold fadil send reinforcements 
order convey information require someone absolutely rely 
said felt sure would volunteer service 
course certain extent dangerous one think speaking language already among dervishes might even taken prisoner make good story 
would undertake commission pleasure gregory said 
shall course go native dress 
propose carry hundred miles river us land 
point would sixty seventy miles across desert atbara would strike forty fifty miles el fasher 
course would able learn whether parsons crossed 
would ride bank till overtake 
would probably meet mugatta

still possibility may fall hands countrymen surely case mahdi rebellion crushed order restored intend long live jot time time happens order person living interested wife may possibly someday get know fate 
therefore scrap paper scraps may follow ever handed one countrymen pray send mrs hilliard care manager bank cairo

five days since battle 
called battle 
fighting massacre 
men three days incessant fighting exhausted worn half mad thirst half mutinous brought desert said die 
thus dervishes rushed mass defense feeble 
almost knew happened enemy burst one side square 
wild confusion camels dervishes flying egyptians screaming camp followers mixed confusion 
sides square also attacked 
men firing front others turning round shooting crowded mass square 
black regiment side opposite burst 
white officer command fallen ill sent back days left khartoum weeks aiding best powers officers spare hicks asked take place 
done everything could poor fellows comfort march come like obey orders promptly former commander 
long two sides square stood firm soon gave way 
saw hicks staff charge midst dervishes lost sight 
seeing lost called men keep together march regular order repel assaults hope getting free 
obeyed orders splendidly 
two three times dervishes charged upon blacks steady rocks volleys fatal enemy finally left us alone preferring aid slaughter panic stricken egyptians share spoil 
made wells 
man drank fill 
water bottles filled 
marched towards el obeid nightfall dervish horse closed round us 
daylight infantry also arrived fighting began 
day held position killing great numbers losing many men 
night water exhausted 
soldiers offered attack enemy twenty one us said fight one day longer hold 
dervishes may retire may offer us terms 
stood 
next evening lost half number 
drawn one dervish emirs came white flag offered life would surrender would wear badge mahdi soldiers 
replied answer given morning 
left gathered men together 
fought nobly said scarce round ammunition left 
fight tomorrow shall slaughtered 
thank name khedive done urge reject terms offered 
deaths would benefit khedive 
far concerned free accept terms offered 
talked time together three native officers still alive came forward 
bimbashi said done mahometans countrymen white man christian 
would fight mahdi said would fight would gain life price slave 
wish settle matter without reference 
take chance
