great size bones megatheroid animals including megatherium megalonyx scelidotherium mylodon truly wonderful

may naturally asked character vegetation period country wretchedly sterile many co embedded shells living bay first inclined think former vegetation probably similar existing one would erroneous inference shells live luxuriant coast brazil generally characters inhabitants sea useless guides judge land 
nevertheless following considerations believe simple fact many gigantic quadrupeds lived plains round bahia blanca sure guide formerly clothed luxuriant vegetation doubt sterile country little southward near rio negro scattered thorny trees would support many large quadrupeds

fact bullock waggons travel direction excepting near coast without occasionally half hour delay cutting bushes gives perhaps definite notion scantiness vegetation

numbers indeed lion panther hyaena multitude birds prey plainly speak abundance smaller quadrupeds one evening seven lions counted time prowling round dr smith encampment 
able naturalist remarked carnage day southern africa must indeed terrific confess truly surprising number animals find support country producing little food
