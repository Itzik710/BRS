john fuller designing engineer helped two men build ship used drive order weapon seek capture mysterious air pirate whose robberies ruining transcontinental airways 
pirate wade brilliant neurotic chemist discovered among things secret invisibility 
cured instability modern psychomedical techniques hired arcot help build interplanetary vessel go venus 
venusians proved humanoid race people used telepathy communication 
although similar earthmen blue blood double thumbs made enough different caused distrust racial friction planets drawn together common bond defense passing black star 
black star nigra dead burned sun surrounded planetary system much like 
people forced use science produce enough heat light stay alive cold black depths interstellar space 
nothing evil menacing attack solar system simply wanted star gave light heat 
attacked realizing attacking beings equal intelligence 
another disadvantage 
nigrans spent long millennia fighting environment time fight among knew nothing wage war 
earthmen venusians knew well since long history war planet 
inevitably nigrans driven back black star 
war 
things became dull 
taste adventure still remained tongues arcot wade morey 
footnote see black star passes ace books f 
three men sat around table littered graphs sketches mathematical functions books tensor formulae 
beside table stood munson bradley integraph calculator one men using check equations already derived 
results getting seemed indicate something well beyond expected 
anything surprised team arcot wade morey surprising indeed 
intercom buzzed interrupting work 
dr richard arcot reached lifted switch 
arcot speaking 
face flashed screen businesslike determined 
dr arcot mr fuller 
orders check visitors 
arcot nodded 
send 
anyone father interplanetary chairman elder mr morey 
come bother call send em 
receive calls next ten hours 
got bothered dr arcot 
arcot cut circuit image collapsed 
less two minutes later light flashed door 
arcot touched release door slid aside 
looked man entering said mock coldness late john fuller 
take plane took hour get chicago 
fuller shook head sadly 
time spent getting past guards 
getting seventy fourth floor transcontinental airways building harder stealing taj mahal 
trying suppress grin fuller bowed low 
besides think would royal highness good kept waiting 
paid couple million year putter around lab honest people work living 
happen stub toe useful gadget increase pay 
call scientists spend resources two worlds get anything want apologize get within twenty four hours 
doubt majesties good wait 
superior smile seated table shuffled calmly sheets equations 
arcot wade laughing robert morey 
sorrowful expression walked window looked hundreds slim graceful aircars floated city 
friends said morey almost tearfully give great dr arcot 
countless machines see come one idea 
idea mind worked mathematical form made calculable therefore useful worked math interplanetary ships without would never built turned dramatically though playing king lear 
get pointed accusing finger arcot 
get called earth brilliant physicist hard work referred mathematical assistant 
shook head solemnly 
hard world 
table wade frowned looked ceiling 
make quotations accurate trustworthy 
news said arcot system brilliant physicist brilliant mathematical assistant showed great genius developing mathematics dr arcot new theory 
delivered speech wade began stoking pipe 
fuller tapped fingers table 
come clowns knock tell called hard working man away drafting table come play room 
got sleeve time oh bad said arcot leaning back comfortably chair 
sorry busy 
thinking going see antares betelguese polaris looked like close range 
get bored might run giant model nebula andromeda one others 
tough busy might helped us designing ship earned board passage 
tough 
arcot looked fuller sadly 
fuller eyes narrowed 
knew arcot kidding also knew far arcot would go kidding sounded like meant 
fuller said look teacher man named einstein said velocity light tops two hundred years ago nobody come counter evidence yet 
lord instituted new speed law oh said wade waving pipe grand gesture importance 
arcot decided like law made new one 
wait minute said fuller 
velocity light property space arcot bantering smile gone 
got fuller 
velocity light einstein said property space 
happens change space fuller blinked 
change space arcot pointed toward glass water sitting nearby 
things look distorted water light rays bent 
bent wave front moves air water slows 
electromagnetic gravitational fields atoms strong enough increase curvature space 
happens reverse effect oh said fuller softly 
get 
changing curvature space surrounding could get velocity wanted 
acceleration would take years reach velocities acceleration man could stand 
arcot shook head 
take look glass water 
happens light comes water speeds instantaneously 
changing space around spaceship instantaneously change velocity ship comparable velocity space 
since every particle accelerated rate feel feel acceleration due gravity free fall 
fuller nodded slowly 
suddenly light gleamed eyes 
suppose figured going get energy power ship like said morey 
uncle arcot type forget little detail like 
okay give said fuller 
arcot grinned lit pipe joining wade attempt fill room impenetrable fog 
right arcot began needed two things tremendous source power way store 
first ordinary atomic energy 
controllable enough uranium something could carry ton 
began working high density currents 
temperature liquid helium near absolute zero lead becomes nearly perfect conductor 
back nineteen twenty physicists succeeded making current flow four hours closed circuit 
ring lead resistance low current kept flowing 
even managed get six hundred amperes piece lead wire bigger pencil lead 
know go possibly insulation necessary keep corona effect high density current electrons tend push sideways wire 
rate tried using lux metal insulator around wire 
hold fuller interrupted 
may ask lux metal wade idea arcot grinned 
remember two substances found nigran ships war sure said fuller 
one transparent perfect reflector 
said made light photons greatly condensed held together gravitational fields 
right 
called light metal 
wade said confusing 
specific gravity 
light metal certainly light metal wade coined couple words 
lux latin light named transparent one lux reflecting one relux 
sounds peculiar fuller observed every coined word first hear 
go story 
arcot relit pipe went 
put current ten thousand amps little piece lead wire gave current density amps per square inch 
started jacking voltage modified thing double polarity field somewhat similar molecular motion field except works sub nucleonic level 
result half lead fed chamber became contraterrene lead atoms turned inside speak giving us atom positrons circling negatively charged nucleus 
even gave neutrons reverse spin converting anti neutrons 
result total annihilation matter contraterrene lead atoms met terrene lead atoms mutual annihilation resulted giving us pure energy 
power bled power mechanism rest useful energy 
got power need power literally ton 
fuller said nothing looked dazed 
well beginning believe three men could impossible order 
second thing arcot continued said way store energy could released rapidly slowly needed 
morey baby 
figured would possible use space strain apparatus store energy 
old method induction coils condensers even gravity storing energy straining space 
morey apparatus could store lot 
torus shaped induction coil encloses magnetic field within torus doughnut coil perfectly enclosed magnetic field 
built enclosed coil using morey principle expected store watts power see long could hold 
unfortunately made mistake connecting city power lines cost us hundred fifty dollars quarter cent per kilowatt hour 
blew fuses place 
used relux plate generator 
rate gadget store power plenty put way 
arcot knocked ashes pipe smiled fuller 
essentials offer 
give job figuring stresses strains involved 
want ship cruising radius thousand million light years 
yes sir right away sir want gross dozen fuller asked sarcastically 
sure believe big orders whence cometh cold cash lovely dream said morey darkly trouble comes 
convince dad 
president transcontinental airways boss trouble also father 
hears want go gallivanting universe guys likely turn thumbs whole deal 
besides arcot dad lot influence around healthy hunch like idea either 
rather fear agreed arcot gloomily 
silence hung room felt almost heavy pall pipe smoke air conditioners trying frantically disperse 
elder mr morey full control finances 
ship would cost easily hundreds millions dollars well beyond anything four men could get 
inventions property transcontinental even one four men would think selling another company 
finally wade said think stand much better chance show big spectacular exhibition something really impressive 
point advantages uses apparatus 
show complete plans ship 
might consent 
might replied morey smiling 
worth try anyway 
let get city 
go place vermont 
use lab need 
got everything worked need stay 
besides got lake indulge little atavism fish stage evolution 
good enough arcot agreed grinning broadly 
need lake 
city eighty five aircars soaking heat molecular drive country nineties 
mountains let pack ii many books papers collected hastily put briefcases four men took elevator landing area roof 
take car morey said 
rest leave 
safe days 
piled morey slid driver seat turned power 
rose slowly looking traffic great city 
new york long since abandoned rivers trade routes covered solidly steel decks used public landing fields ground car routes 
around loomed titanic structures glistening colored tile 
sunlight reflected brilliantly contrasting colors buildings seemed blend together great multicolored painting 
darting planes traffic commerce great buildings pleasure cars combined give series changing darting shadows wove flickering pattern city 
long lines ships coming chicago london buenos aires san francisco constant flow across pole russia india china like mighty black serpents wound way city 
morey cut northbound traffic level moved high speed lane eased accelerator 
held traffic pattern two hundred fifty miles well past boston turned first break fired ship toward goal vermont 
less forty five minutes since left new york morey dropping car toward little mountain lake offered place seclusion 
gently let ship glide smoothly shed first molecular motion ship built 
arcot jumped saying unload get going 
think swim sleep order start work ship 
begin tomorrow 
looked approvingly clear blue water little lake 
wade climbed pushed arcot one side 
right way little one let man get going 
headed house briefcases 
arcot six feet two weighed close two hundred wade another two inches taller weighed good fifty pounds 
arms chest built general plan gorilla 
good reason call arcot little 
morey though still taller heavily formed weighed pounds arcot fuller bit smaller arcot 
due several factors size average human steadily increasing several centuries 
wade would considered big man average person average man six feet tall 
relaxed afternoon swimming indulging wrestling matches 
wrestling wade consistently proved built like gorilla muscled like one arcot proved skill without merit several times found could make match last two minutes wade huge muscles would find insufficient oxygen supply tire quickly 
evening dinner morey engaged wade fierce battle chess fuller interested spectator 
arcot watching saying nothing 
several minutes uneventful play morey stopped suddenly glared board 
make move intended move queen check king red diagonal 
yeah replied wade gloomily wanted 
sure checkmate three moves 
arcot smiled quietly 
continued play several moves wade remarked something seemed influencing play 
intended trade queens 
glad though think leaves better position 
sure agreed morey 
due clean queen trade 
surprised usually go trades 
afraid position hopeless 

next ten moves wade spotted weak points every attack morey made attack crumbled disastrously white forced resign king hopeless position 
wade rubbed chin 
know morey seemed know exactly made every move saw every possibility involved 
yeah noticed said morey grin 
come morey let try game said fuller sliding chair wade vacated 
although ordinarily equally matched fuller morey went disastrous defeat amazingly short time 
almost seemed fuller could anticipate every move 
brother form today said rising table 
come arcot let see try wade 
arcot sat although never played chess extensively others proceeded clean wade lock stock barrel 
come asked morey astonishment saw complicated formation working formation knew far better arcot usual game 
worked felt proud 
arcot looked smiled 
answer morey morey blinked 
answer yes meant surprised seen done 
experienced teacher 
figured would come handy explorations 
morey face grew astonished arcot strange monologue continued 
finally arcot turned wade looking morey wide eyed wonder 
time wade began talking monologue 
said surprised voice 
long pause arcot stared wade intensity fuller began understand happening 
well said wade learned trick thoroughly try 
let see project thoughts go ahead fuller understanding fully going burst laughing 
projecting thoughts said word looked arcot 
matter fact said little know pulled telepathic stunt though quite convinced 
spent three months venus back said arcot studying one foremost telepathists 
actually time spent theory learning difficult proposition 
takes practice 
whole secret everyone power ancient power human brain lower animals possess greater degree humans 
man developed language gave thoughts concreteness permitted freer clearly conceived type thinking 
result telepathy fell disuse 
going show invaluable meet strange race 
projecting pictures concepts dispense going trouble learning language 
learn basics need practice watch much practice give great granddaddy headaches okay begin arcot spent rest evening teaching venerian system telepathy 
rose nine 
arcot got first others found expedient follow example shortly thereafter 
brought large tesla coil bedroom lab succeeded inducing sufficient voltage bedsprings make effective though harmless sparks 
come boys hit deck wade chief chemist synthesize little coffee heat treat eggs us 
work ahead today rise shine shut coil assured gotten considerable distance bed 
ouch yelled morey 
okay shut want get pants win breakfast went room used calculating room 
two different types integraph calculators plenty paper equipment calculations draw graphs 
begin said fuller let decide shape want use 
designer like point sphere strongest cube easiest build torpedo shape efficient aerodynamically 
however intend use space air 
remember need home ship greater part trip 
might need aerodynamically stable hull wade interjected 
came mighty handy venus 
darned useful emergencies 
think arcot favor torpedo shape 
okay got hull 
engines run let get 
name general things first facts figures come later 
first must powerful mass energy converter 
could use cavity radiator use cosmic rays warm drive individual power units way main electrical power unit warm electrically 
one would better morey frowned 
think safer depend one plant separate possible 
individual cavity radiators 
question interjected fuller 
cavity radiators work built like thermos bottle arcot explained 
inner shell rough relux absorb heat efficiently outer one polished relux keep radiation inside 
two run flow helium two tons per square inch pressure carry heat molecular motion apparatus 
neck bottle contain atomic generator 
fuller still looked puzzled 
see new space strain drive molecular drive move around near heavy mass presence strong gravitational field arcot said 
gravitational field tends warp space way velocity light lower presence 
drive tries warp strain space opposite manner 
two would simply cancel waste lot power going nowhere 
matter fact gravitational field sun intense go beyond orbit pluto use space strain drive effectively 
catch said fuller 
get back generators 
think power units would simpler controlled one electrical power source reliable 
anyway molecular motion power controlled necessity single generator one apt go bad 
good reasoning smiled morey still strong decentralization 
suggest compromise 
main power unit main verticals largest controlled individual cosmic ray heaters rest run electric power units 
heating coils surrounded field 
good idea said arcot 
favor compromise 
okay fuller okay 
next problem weapons 
suggest use separate control panel separate generating panel power tubes want molecular beam projectors 
molecular beam projector simply projected field caused molecular motion take place wanted 
weapons terrifically deadly 
half mountain suddenly thrown air random motion molecules becomes concentrated one direction becomes difficult projectile fight 
touch bow ship beam bow drops absolute zero driven back stern speed billions molecules 
general effect similar produced two ships head collision ten miles per second 
anything touched beam broken molecules twisted strength crushed toughness 
nothing resist 
idea arcot went since power used beams drive two separate power tube banks generate 
way one breaks switch 
even use drive necessary molecular motion machines stand make relux anchor lux metal beams 
projectors would able handle power using dad new system 
give us protection time full power 
since several projectors power needed operate ship equal power required operate projectors 
also suggest mount heat beam projectors 
objected wade 
less effective molecular rays 
molecular beams instantly irresistible heat beams take time heat target 
sure unhealthy deal molecular beam 
true enough arcot agreed heat beam spectacular may find mere spectacular display accomplish much actual destruction 
besides heat beams local effect 
want kill enemy spare captive want beam deadly hits fifty yards around 
hold second said fuller wearily 
heat beams 
guys think ought explain little bit poor goon designing flying battlewagon get heat beam arcot grinned 
simple 
use small atomic cavity radiator one end rough relux parabolic filter 
beyond lux metal lens 
relux heats tremendously since polished relux reflect back heat radiated lux metal lens powerful heat beam 
okay fine said fuller 
stop springing new gadgets try arcot laughed 
anyway let get main power plant 
remember condenser coil gadget storing energy space therefore obliged supply energy store 
forming drive field alone require two times ten twenty seventh ergs energy two half tons matter 
means whale lot lead wire fed conversion generators would take several hours charge coils 
better two big chargers job 
controls figure later 
suggestions sounds okay said morey others agreed 
good enough 
far air water go use standard spacecraft apparatus fuller figure way want 
need lab wade put 
machine shop plenty spare parts everything possibly think 
remember may want build things space 
right 
wonder arcot looked thoughtful 
invisibility apparatus may prove useful cost much 
let put 
apparatus mentioned simply high frequency oscillator tube extreme power caused vibrations approaching light frequency set molecules ship 
result ship became transparent since light could easily pass vibrating molecules 
one difficulty ship invisible right became radio sender could easily detected directional radio 
however secret unknown effective method disappearing 
since frequency high special detector required pick 
need asked fuller 
nope said arcot leaning back chair 
comes kicker 
suggest make hull foot thick lux metal line inside relux wherever want opaque 
want relux shutters windows 
lux doggone transparent came close hot star badly burned 
fuller looked almost goggle eyed 
foot lux good lord arcot ship would weigh quarter million tons stuff dense sure agreed arcot need protection 
ship like could run planetoid without hurting hull 
make relux inner wall inch thick vacuum protection warm atmosphere 
tremendous force manage crack outer wall left without protection 
okay boss fuller said resignedly 
going big ship though 
figure length two hundred feet diameter around thirty feet 
interior furnish aluminum cheaper lighter 
observatory put rear ship wade suggested 
mount one nigran telectroscopes 
control room bow course morey chipped 
got fuller said 
work thing give cost estimate drawings 
fine said arcot standing 
meanwhile rest us work little exhibition impress mr morey dad 
come lads let get back lab 
iii two weeks dr robert arcot old friend arthur morey president transcontinental airways invited see sons working 
demonstration take place radiation labs basements transcontinental building 
arcot wade morey fuller brought equipment country place vermont set one heavily lined vault like chambers used radiation experiments 
two older men seated huge eighty inch three dimensional television screen several floors level actual demonstration going 
anyone room radiation burns explained arcot junior 
could surrounded thing relux seen going 
going explain anything beforehand like magic astounding explanation given 
touched switch 
cameras began operate screen sprang life 
screen showed heavy table mounted small projector looked something like searchlight several heavy cables running 
path projector large lux metal crucible surrounded ring relux series points relux aimed crucible 
points ring grounded 
inside crucible small ingot coronium strong hard venerian metal melted twenty five hundred degrees centigrade boiled better four thousand 
crucible entirely enclosed large lux metal case lined side away projector roughened relux 
arcot moved switch control panel 
far heavy relay slammed home suddenly solid beam brilliant bluish light shot projector beam brilliant entire screen lit intense glow spectators thought could almost feel heat 
passed lux metal case coronium bar cut relux liner since rough absorbed ninety nine percent rays struck 
coronium bar glowed red orange yellow white quick succession suddenly slumped molten mass bottom crucible 
crucible filled mass molten metal glowed intensely white seethed furiously 
slowly rising vapors told rapid boiling settling showed temperature high permit remain hot heat radiated away fast 
perhaps ten seconds went suddenly new factor added performance 
sudden crashing arc blaze blue flame swept cyclonic twisting motion inside crucible 
blaze arc intense brilliance incandescent metal weird light beam radiation shifted fantastic play colors 
made strange impressive scene 
suddenly relay sounded beam radiance disappeared quickly come 
instant blue violet glare relux plate subsided angry red 
violent arcing stopped metal cooling rapidly 
heavy purplish vapor crucible condensed walls black flakey crystals 
elder arcot watching scene screen curiously 
wonder said slowly 
physicist say impossible happen imagine would results 
turned look arcot junior 
well go exhibition son 
want know ideas though dad said younger man 
next program little interesting perhaps 
least demonstrates commercial aspect thing 
younger morey operating controls handling robots 
screen machine rolled caterpillar treads picked lux case contents carried 
minute later reappeared large electromagnet relux plate attached huge pair silver busbars 
relux plate set stand directly front projector big electromagnet set directly behind relux plate 
magnet leads connected coil form two toruses intersecting right angles enclosed form fitting relux case connected heavy terminals relux plate 
ammeter heavy coil coronium wire connected series coil kilovoltmeter connected across terminals relux plate 
soon connections completed robot backed swiftly room arcot turned magnet ray projector 
instantly sharp deflection kilovoltmeter 
yet closed switch leading coil explained current 
ammeter needle moved 
despite fact voltmeter seemed shorted relux plate needle pointed steadily twenty two 
arcot changed current magnet reading dropped twenty 
rays low power air slightly ionized arcot turned rheostat intensity increased air path beam shone intense blue 
relux plate subject eddy currents since path energy take began heat rapidly 
going close switch coil said arcot 
watch meters 
relay snapped instantly ammeter jumped read amperes 
voltmeter gave slight kick remained steady 
heavy coronium spring grew warm began glow dully ammeter dropped slightly increased resistance 
relux plate cooled slightly voltmeter remained steady 
coil see storing energy flowing arcot explained 
notice coronium resistor increasing resistance otherwise little increase back emf energy coming rays strike polarized relux plate give current 
paused moment make slight adjustments controls turned attention back screen 
kilovoltmeter still read twenty 
forty five hundred amperes twenty thousand volts elder arcot said softly 
going take look space within right angle torus coils said arcot junior 
getting dark despite powerful light shed ionized air 
indeed space within twin coils rapidly growing dark darkening image things behind oddly blurring outlines 
moment images completely wiped region within coils filled strangely solid blackness 
according instruments young arcot said stored fifteen thousand kilowatt hours energy coil seems limit much power get 
power contains coil worth forty dollars right figured quarter cent per kilowatt hour 
using anywhere near power get apparatus either 
watch 
threw another switch shorted around coronium resistor ammeter allowing current run coil directly plate 
direct reading explained indirect reading magnetic field room shows current nearly hundred million amperes younger morey watching panel meters side screen 
suddenly shouted cut arcot conductors setting secondary field plate causing trouble 
instantly arcot hand went switch 
relay slammed open ray projector died 
power coil still held field enigmatic blackness 
watch arcot instructed 
expert manipulation small robot handler rolled room 
pair pliers clutched one claw 
spectators watched screen fascination robot drew back arm hurled pliers black field might 
pliers struck blackness rebounded hit rubber wall 
arcot caused little machine pick pliers repeat process 
arcot grinned 
cut power coil 
unlike ordinary induction coil necessary keep supplying power thing static condition 
see much energy holds 
handy little gadget shut rest instruments television screen turned father 
demonstration 
got theories dad elder dr arcot frowned thought 
thing think would produce effect like stream positrons contraterrene nuclei 
would explain heating electrical display 
far coil goes easy understand 
energy storage device stores energy strain space actually see strain space 
smiled son 
see ex laboratory assistant come long way 
achieved controlled usable atomic energy total annihilation mass 
right arcot smiled back nodded 
right dad 
son wonder give data sheets process 
like work mathematical problems involved 
sure dad 
right arcot turned toward elder mr morey 
interested mathematics finance 
proposition put mr morey proposition simply stated perhaps simply stated took fully hour arcot wade morey discuss science two older men fuller spent another hour carefully drawn plans ship 
last elder mr morey settled back looked vacantly ceiling 
seated conference room transcontinental airways 
well boys said mr morey usual position forced yield 
might refuse financial backing could sell one gadgets close billion dollars finance expedition independently could names request money publicly back way 
paused moment 
however thinking terms safety terms money 
another long pause smiled four younger men 
think however trust 
armed cosmic molecular rays able put fair scrap anywhere 
also never detected signs feeblemindedness think get jam get 
back 
hate interrupt exuberance said elder dr arcot like know name remarkable ship 
asked wade 
name oh 
elder morey shook head sadly 
indeed important oversight 
crew men overlook fundamental thing wonder trusted 
well going call asked arcot 
solarite ii might suggested morey 
still solar system 
think broadminded said arcot 
going stay system even galaxy 
might call galaxian 
say broadminded asked wade 
let really broad call universite something like 
better yet call fluorine everywhere universe active element 
ship go everywhere universe active thing ever existed good name said elder morey 
gets vote young arcot looked thoughtful 
mighty good like idea lacks ring 
paused looking ceiling repeated slowly alone alone alone alone wide wide sea saint took pity soul agony 
rose walked window looking bright points light stars space rode high deep violet moonlit sky 
sea space sea vastness lies far flung nebulae mighty void alone sea vastness man imagine alone alone man alone far matter mankind even light racing billions miles day could reach home less million years 
arcot stopped stood looking window 
morey broke silence 
ancient mariner 
paused 
alone certainly right 
think name takes prizes 
fuller nodded slowly 
certainly agree 
ancient mariner 
kind long name 
adopted unanimously 
iv ancient mariner built big transcontinental shops newark power needed available smaller shops 
working twenty four hours day three shifts skilled men took two months finish hull according fuller specifications 
huge walls lux metal required great care construction could welded formed position 
could polished powerful magnets dense magnetic field softened lux metal enough allow diamond polisher job 
hull finished came laborious work installing power plant tremendous power leads connectors circuits relays thousand complex circuits 
much standard molecular power tubes molecular ray projectors power tubes invisibility apparatus many parts 
relays standard gyroscopic stabilizers standard electromagnetic braking equipment gyros standard 
would long days work ahead arcot wade morey could install special equipment could put complicated wiring one else earth understood circuits establish 
weeks waiting arcot friends worked auxiliary devices used ship 
wanted make improvements old molecular ray pistols develop atomic powered heat projectors hand use 
primary power stored small space strain coils handgrip pistol 
despite small size coils capable storing power thirty hours continuous operation rays 
finished weapon scarcely larger standard molecular ray pistol 
arcot pointed many planets might visit would larger earth lacked way getting readily high gravity 
since something done arcot 
demonstrated friends one day shop yard 
morey wade see fuller details ship came arcot called work bench 
wearing space suit without helmet 
modern space suit made woven lux metal wires extremely small diameter airproofed rubberoid fluorocarbon plastic furnished air heating units 
made offered protection nothing else could offer almost perfect insulator resistant attack chemical reagent 
even elemental fluorine could corrode 
extreme strength lux metal fiber made stronger pound pound steel coronium 
arcot back pack relux plated metal 
connected relux web belts broad belt circled arcot waist 
one thin cable ran right arm small relux tube eight inches long two inches diameter 
watch arcot said grinning 
reached belt flipped little switch 
long see later pointed right arm toward ceiling sailed lightly air 
lowered angle arm moved smoothly across huge hangar floating toward shining bulk rapidly forming ancient mariner 
circled room rising sinking headed open door 
come watch room called 
open darted high air mere speck sky 
suddenly came dropping landed lightly swaying feet poised lightly toes 
jump said morey mock surprise 
yeah agreed fuller 
try 
wade put give weight annihilator beat game 
secret cute gadget 
much load carry asked morey practically 
develop ten tons far goes human body take five gravities visit planets less surface gravity 
principle easy see show 
unhooked cables took power pack back 
main thing molecular power unit electrically heated mounted small massive gyroscope 
gyro necessary 
tried leaving almost took nosedive 
coupled directly body leaned forward little bit air 
without gyro keep drive upright took loop started heading ground 
fancy gymnastics keep ending six feet literally 
power generated pack small power plate several storage coils 
also got hooked holsters belt charge pistols carry 
control secondary power cable running arm hand 
gives direction rheostat belt changes velocity 
made one far ordered six others like 
thought guys might like one 
think guessed right said morey looking inside power case 
hey extra room case unperfected invention yet might want put stuff private use 
men tried apparatus found quite satisfactory 
meanwhile work done 
wade given job gathering necessary food anything else way supplies might think 
arcot collecting necessary spare parts apparatus 
morey gathering small library equipping chemistry laboratory 
fuller get together necessary standard equipment ship tables seats bunks furniture 
took months work seemed would never finished finally one clear warm day august ship completely equipped ready go 
last inspection elder dr arcot elder mr morey went four younger men 
stood beside great intergalactic cruiser looking shining hull 
came bit later expected son said dr arcot still expect good show 
paused frowned understand intend take trial trip 
idea arcot afraid father would worried framed explanation carefully 
dad figured ship last decimal place best make 
remember molecular motion drive get trial first give trial trip leave sun 
trouble naturally return 
equipment standard expecting trouble 
part would require trial trip space control apparatus way give trial trip 
remember get far enough sun gravitational field weak enough drive overcome 
tried close trying neutralize sun gravity 
pouring energy wasting great deal away sun get energy back 
hand get get started go faster light hopelessly beyond range molecular motion drive instant 
words space control drive work come back work need come back 
anything goes wrong ones could fix anyway 
anything goes wrong radio earth 
ought able hear dozen years 
smiled suddenly 
say might go get back time hear talking see felt little reason trial trip 
failure never back say able continue 
father still looked worried nodded acquiescence 
perfect logic son guess may well give discussion 
personally like 
let see ship 
great hull two hundred feet long thirty feet diameter 
outer wall one foot solid lux metal separated inner one inch relux wall two inch gap would evacuated space 
two walls joined many places small lux metal cross braces 
windows consisted spaces relux wall allowing occupants see transparent lux hull 
outside difficult detect exact outline ship clear lux metal practically invisible foot surrounded visible part ship gave curious optical illusion 
perfect reflecting ability relux made inner hull difficult see 
absence presence one detected blotted things behind 
great window pilot room disclosed pilot seats great switchboard one side 
windows equipped relux shield slid position touch switch already place observatory window long narrow portholes showed lighted interior 
minutes elder men stood looking graceful beauty ship 
come see inside suggested fuller 
entered airlock close base ship 
heavy lux door opened automatic machinery inside combination depended use molecular ray knowledge correct place made impossible anyone open unless ray knew use 
airlock went directly power room 
heard soft purring large oscillator tube indistinguishable murmur smoothly running ac generators powered large contraterrene reactors 
elder dr arcot glanced surprise heavy duty ammeter control panel 
half billion amperes good lord power going looked son 
storage coils 
going ten kilovolts five billion kilowatt supply 
going half hour half hour run 
takes two tons matter charge coil capacity carrying twenty tons fuel enough ten charges 
need three tons goes well seldom 
see large black cylinder arcot asked pointing 
lying along roof power room lay great black cylinder nearly two feet diameter extending wall rear 
made integral two giant lux metal beams reached bow ship long sweeping curve 
one power switchboards two heavy cables ran giant cylinder 
main horizontal power unit 
develop acceleration ten gravities either forward backward 
curve ship top sides bottom power units motion two directions 
rest stuff section old hat though 
come next room 
arcot opened heavy relux door leading way next room twice size power room 
center floor occupied heavy pedestal lux metal upon huge relux encased double torus storage coil 
large switchboard opposite end around room ordered groups stood familiar double coils five feet diameter 
space within already darkening 
well said arcot senior battery power coils considering amount energy one store 
big one main space control younger arcot answered 
power stored smaller ones shoot one notice constructed slightly differently 
instead holding field within completely enclosed big one affect space 
enclosed might called hyperspace making 
see said father 
go hyperspace move speed please 
see going far know 
expect see thing hyperspace 
simply aim ship direction want go go hyperspace 
thing avoid stars gravitational fields would drain energy apparatus end center white hot star 
meteors worry fields strong enough drain coils since normal space hit 
elder morey looked worried 
see way back get lost radio back help 
worse said arcot 
receive signal kind get three hundred light years away radios 
locate sun light 
take photographs every often orient come back 
sounds like excellent method stellar navigation agreed morey senior 
let see rest ship 
turned walked toward farther door 
next room laboratory 
one side room complete physics lab well stocked well equipped chemistry lab 
could perform many experiments man able perform due lack power 
ship generating facilities power stations earth combined arcot opened next door 
next room physics chemistry storeroom 
duplicate cases six seven duplicates every piece apparatus board plenty material make 
actually enough equipment make new ship 
would good deal smaller would work 
greater part materials stored curvature ship easy get necessary 
water food emergency oxygen tanks 
let take stairway upper deck 
upper deck main living quarters 
several small rooms side corridor center extreme nose control room extreme stern observatory 
observatory equipped small exceedingly powerful telectroscope developed nigrans left one deserted planets sol captured return loss pluto black star 
arc commanded instrument great easy turn ship observations could made without trouble 
men room small galley library equipped books four men could think useful 
books equipment clamped place keep flying around loose ship accelerated 
control room nose surrounded hemisphere transparent lux metal enabled see every direction except directly behind even blind spot could covered stationing man observatory 
heat projectors molecular ray projectors operated control room nose 
complete armament projectors stern controlled observatory set either side controlled library galley 
ship provisioned two years two years without stops 
possibility stopping planets four men could exist indefinitely ship 
two older men shown intergalactic vessel elder arcot turned old friend 
morey looks time us leave ancient mariner pilots guess right 
well say goodbye know lot could say 
morey senior looked started toward airlock 
goodbye son said elder arcot 
goodbye men 
expecting time within two years 
warning suppose ship outrace radio beam 
goodbye 
dr arcot joined old friend went outside 
heavy lux metal door slid place behind thick plastic cushions sealed entrance airlock 
workmen personnel around ship cleared area stood well back great hull 
two older men waved men inside ship 
suddenly ship trembled rose toward sky 
v arcot controls ancient mariner increased acceleration ship speared toward interplanetary space 
soon deep blue sky given way intense violet faded utter black space ship drew away planet home 
lump dust going look mighty little get back said wade softly 
arcot reminded little lump dust going pull us across distance imaginations conceive 
darned happy see pale globe swinging space get back provided course get back 
ship straining forward pull molecular motion power units accelerating steady rate rapidly increasing distance ship earth 
cosmic ray power generators still charging coils preventing use space strain drive 
indeed would good many hours would far enough sun throw ship hyperspace 
meantime morey methodically checking every control arcot called readings control panel 
everything working perfection 
every calculation checked practice far 
real test yet come 
well beyond orbit pluto decided would safe using space strain drive throwing ship hyperspace 
morey hyperspace control room watching instruments 
ready hold called arcot 
go reached control panel touched green switch controlled molecular motion machines 
big power tubes cut acceleration ceased 
fingers pushed brilliant red switch dull muffled thud huge relay snapped shut 
suddenly strange tingling feeling power ran space around suddenly black 
lights dimmed instant titanic current flowed gigantic conductors set terrific magnetic field reacting absorption plates 
power seemed climb rapidly maximum quite suddenly gone 
ship quiet 
one spoke 
meters flashed limits dropped back zero except indicated power stored giant coil 
stars shone brilliantly around myriad colors gone 
space around glowed strangely vast cloud strange violet pale green stars 
directly ahead one green star glowed big brilliant faded rapidly shrank tiny dot distant star 
strange tenseness men seemed held odd compelled silence 
arcot reached forward 
cutting power morey red tumbler snapped back 
space seemed charged vast surplus energy rushed around coursing bodies producing tingling feeling 
space rocked gray cloud stars leaped blazing glory 
well worked breathed arcot sigh relief 
lord made errors calculation though hope make morey used one sixteenth power 
well use said morey 
sure traveled things worked perfectly 
way good thing relays magnetically shielded magnetic field strong pocket kit tried start running circles around 
according magnetic drag meter conductors carrying fifty billion amperes 
small coils worked perfectly 
charged power went back big coil five percent loss power twenty thousand megawatts 
hey arcot wade said 
thought said able see stars 
arcot spread hands 
say apologies 
seeing light 
stars projections shadows space intense gravitational fields 
probably slight fluctuations field perhaps one every minute 
since approaching twenty thousand times speed light doppler effect gives us looks like violet light 
saw stars front us violet points 
green ones actually behind us green light tremendously reduced frequency 
certainly anything less gamma rays probably even greater frequency 
notice stars side approaching give either effect 
know asked fuller skeptically 
see green star directly ahead us arcot asked 
one dwindled rapidly could sun since sun star close enough show disc 
since green knew behind us decided green ones behind us 
proof good indication 
win usual admitted fuller 
well asked wade 
think important 
least idea confessed arcot 
let see find 
got robot pilot leave ship 
let take look old sol distance man ever reached started observatory 
morey joined arcot put view sol family telectroscope screen 
increased magnification maximum four men looked eagerly system 
sun glowed brilliantly planets showed plainly 
wanted take trouble could calculate planets position determine distance come 
however notice pluto still place means seeing solar system passing black star 
least two light years away 
said morey 
pointed screen 
see mars placed relation venus earth planets configuration seven years ago 
seven light years earth 
good enough arcot grinned 
means within two light years sirius since headed direction 
let turn ship take look telectroscope 
since power cut ship free fall men weightless 
arcot try walk toward control room simply pushed wall feet made long slow dive destination 
others reached handgrips walls arcot swung ship gently around stern pointed toward sirius 
brilliance relative proximity sol sirius brightest star heavens seen earth 
much lesser distance shone brilliant point light blazed wonderfully 
turned telectroscope toward little could see visible big observatory moon 
think may well go nearer suggested morey see find close range observation 
meanwhile turn ship back around take pictures sun surrounding star field distance 
way getting back going series pictures think best make complete 
first light century ought take picture every ten light years one light century reach point getting diminishing pictures local star cluster 
wait reach edge galaxy 
sounds right agreed arcot 
astronomer 
tell truth search find old sol 
see 
course could locate means gyroscope settings afraid find easily visually 
say sure fine one pilot expedition space cried wade mock horror 
think ought demote imagine plans trip thousand million light years gets us seven light years says know even know home glad cautious man like morey along 
shook head sadly 
took series six plates sun using different magnifications 
plates help prove story said morey looked finished plates 
might gone little way space plane ecliptic taken plates wide angle camera 
go least seven years past get picture like 
new self developing short exposure plates perfect color balance desirable work since took less time exposure 
morey others joined arcot control room strapped cushioned seats 
since space strain mechanism proved first test felt needed observations could make control room meters 
arcot gazed spot immediate goal said slowly much bigger sol star morey depends measure size morey replied 
two half times heavy four times volume radiates twenty five times much light 
words one hundred million tons matter disappear second star 
sirius course 
sirius b companion different matter white dwarf 
one one hundred twenty five thousandths volume sirius weighs one third much 
radiates per square inch sun due tiny size faint 
star though almost massive sun size earth 
sure statistics pat said fuller laughing 
must say interesting 
star made anyway solid lux metal hardly morey replied 
lux metal density around star density high one cubic inch matter would weigh ton earth 
wow wade ejaculated 
hate drop baseball toe star hurt arcot said smiling 
could lift darned thing ought tough enough stand dropping toe 
remember would weigh two hundred tons think could handle rate go 
get get try 
came shock start 
heavens seemed reel bright spot sirius brilliant violet point swelled like expanding balloon spreading filled large angle 
heavens reeled still 
control room filled dazzling splendor brilliant blue white light intense heat beat upon 
brother feel heat said arcot awe 
better watch thing giving plenty ultraviolet 
could end third degree sunburns careful 
suddenly stopped looked around surprise 
hey morey thought said double star look white dwarf planet ridiculous snapped morey 
impossible planet equilibrium double star paused bewildered 
planet made many measurements star make possible give hang whether wade said coolly fact remains 
looks shoots whole flock holes bedtime story telling us superdense star 
make motion look closely first said fuller quite logically 
first telectroscope served confuse 
certainly planet strange vague feeling seen 
arcot mentioned wade launched long pedantic discussion left right hemispheres brain get step times causing sensation seen thing impossible seen previously 
arcot gave wade long withering stare pushed library without saying word 
moment later back large volume entitled astronomy nigran invasion k harkness 
opened volume full page photograph third planet black star taken space cruiser circling planet 
silently pointed image swimming screen telectroscope 
good lord said wade astonished surprise 
impossible came faster light planet got first brilliantly remarked moment ago arcot pointed give hang whether 
know clear number things 
according records found ancient nigrans force ray could move planets orbits 
wonder used break double star also know scientists looking method moving faster light could 
moved whole system planets getting rid upsetting influence white dwarf 
perfect exclaimed morey enthusiastically 
explains everything 
except saw companion star stopped back half hour ago said fuller 
half hour ago arcot contradicted 
two years ago 
saw light left companion moved 
rather like traveling time 
asked fuller suddenly worried time relation earth moved space strain drive times arcot explained would return exactly time left 
time passing normally earth us right whenever use space strain move instantaneously one point another far earth rest universe concerned 
seems take time us within influence field 
suppose take trip required week 
words three days traveling space strain day look destination three days coming back 
returned earth would insist gone one day time spent drive 
see catch said fuller 
way take photographs system otherwise earth get news several years yet 
right agreed morey 
might well look planets black star 
made several plates continuing observations planets located even old pluto crews nigran technicians obviously work building giant structures lux metal 
great cities nigrans beginning bloom bleak plains planet 
mighty blaze sirius warmed pluto vaporizing atmosphere thawing seas 
planet black star stolen solar system warmer two billion years 
well said arcot finished taking necessary photographs 
prove went faster light easily 
astronomers take work classifying planets getting details orbits get back 
since nigrans sun reason hostility race 
perhaps start commercial trade 
imagine commerce quintillions miles space interrupted wade make trip system less time takes get venus meanwhile said morey let get exploration 
strapped control seats arcot threw molecular drive take away sun toward falling 
great hot disc sirius diminished tiny white pinhead light arcot turned ship old sol showed plainly cross hairs aiming telescope rear vessel 
hold arcot cautioned go threw little red tumbler threw flood energy coils 
space seemed shiver grow dim 
arcot thrown power coils time stars ahead instead appearing violet almost invisible radiating ultra violet 
stars behind instead appearing green subsided dull red glow 
arcot watched dull red spark sirius become increasingly dimmer 
quite suddenly pale violet disc front ballooned nowhere slid one side 
spaceship reeled perking men around control seats 
heavy safety relays thudded dully instruments flickered suddenly rising surge power calm 
arcot snapped power switch 
said quietly good 
threw gyroscopes asked morey voice equally quiet 
idea far 
course know direction headed 
vi matter asked fuller anxiously 
arcot pointed window red star blazed distance 
got near field gravity young giant threw us loss 
drained three fourths energy coils lost bearings bargain 
attraction turned gyroscopes threw ship line longer know sun 
well come morey start search 
distance best go sirius brighter nearer 
looked instrument panel 
using next lowest power still avoid monster 
ship little hot handle 
position anything pleasant 
must pick vast star field behind one star home knowing exactly 
one tremendous help photographs star field around sol taken last stop 
search area matched photographs 
found sun last spotted sirius rotate ship nearly twenty five degrees 
establishing bearings took new photographs files 
meanwhile wade recharging coils 
finished reported fact arcot 
fine arcot said 
going use least possible amount power 
certainly safe use 
started control room much relieved 
arcot dived first wade directly behind 
wade decided suddenly go room stopped grabbing handhold 
morey following close behind bumped brought rest wade pushed room 
fuller coming last slammed morey moved forward new velocity toward control room leaving fuller hanging rest middle corridor 
hey morey laughed 
send skyhook caught isolated middle corridor push anything remained stranded 
go sleep advised morey 
comfortable bed find wade looked room 
well old weakmuscles fuller weighs absolutely nothing still weak push around 
come though morey give hand got dead center 
fuller flailed hand helplessly 
use brains said morey see 
come wade going 
since going use space control would remain free fall fuller would remain helplessly suspended mid air 
air ship suddenly seemed supercharged energy space around became gray stars 
ship moving forward 
well old pals said fuller least traffic blocked fairly well feel like eventually help 
however floundered clumsily removed one foam rubber space boots brains tell action equal opposite reaction threw boot possible velocity toward morey reaction motion brought slowly surely handhold wall 
meantime flying boot caught morey chest pronounced smack struggled vainly avoid 
handicapped lack friction arms quite powerful enough move mass quickly legs might done inertia great ever succeed ducking 
round one called arcot laughing 
kid fuller tko appears brains knows use win laughed morey 
concede battle arcot cut space strain drive time fuller reached control room men set making observations 
took additional photographs turned drive 
time passed monotonously examined stars 
little difference scene flaming matter 
little interest work fuller remarked supposed trip exploration observation 
astronomers vacation 
hard work good job experienced astronomer decided limit observations necessary retrace path earth 
want investigate planets land asked morey 
sure agreed fuller 
hunt random look stars like sun apt planets like sol idea replied morey 
well try fuller continued logically 
let pick g type sun head 
well toward edge galaxy thirty thousand light years home 
since originally headed along narrow diameter lens shaped mass stars forms island universe would reach edge soon 
much chance finding g far arcot pointed 
stars 
left galaxy behind us 
let go another galactic nebulae said morey looking almost unbroken night intergalactic space 
could see star separated nearest neighbor thousands light years empty space 
know said wade slowly wondering progress along scientific lines race might make 
mean suppose one lonely stars planets suppose intelligent life evolved one planets 
think progress would much slower 
see mean arcot said 
us earth stars gigantic furnaces light years away 
titanic tests tubes nature automatic reading devices attached hung sky us watch 
learned space stars experiments physicists earth ever secured us 
atoms suns first counted rate revolutions electrons nuclei 
watched sun fuller asked 
sure could compare see white dwarf 
measure parallax nearest star would idea stellar distances 
know bright doradus 
dim van maanen star 
fuller said speculatively wait one scientists invented telectroscope 
arcot shook head 
without knowledge nuclear physics invention telectroscope impossible 
lack opportunity watch stars might teach something would delay knowledge atomic structure 
might learn great deal chemistry newtonian physics go quite ways math even would handicapped 
morey instance would never developed autointegral calculus say nothing tensor spinor calculus developed two hundred years ago without knowledge problems space develop need 
afraid race would quite bit behind us science 
suppose hand visit race far ahead us 
better stay long think might us 
might decide ship threatening simply wipe us 
might even far advanced would mean nothing like ants little squalling babies 
arcot laughed thought 
complimentary picture objected fuller 
wonderful advances made much left able say little 
fuller surprised arcot said 
today opening eyes world science 
race thousand years behind hundreds millions yet come 
man today freshly opened eyes science take mighty pyramid knowledge built long long years future gigantic grasp imagine things ever expanding mind man discover 
arcot voice slowed far look came eyes 
might say greater energy matter annihilation 
doubt 
seen hints something new energy vast transcendently tremendous frightens 
energies mighty suns galaxies whole cosmos hand man energy billion billion billion suns every sun pouring energy rate quintillions horsepower every instant great man going forget lest man destroyed might 
arcot halting speech told intense thought dream awful energies man never conceived 
eyes looked unseeing black velvet space scattered stars 
decide way go added sudden briskness straightened shoulders 
every get new idea sort dream 
likely see solution 
think know solution unless need arises never going use 
dangerous toy 
silence moment morey said quietly got course plotted us 
leave galaxy steep angle forty five degrees galactic plane give us good view galaxy 
head one nebulae general area 
say say remarked fuller great void without seems leaked poor self 
thirty thousand years since going meal morning whatever mean want another 
looked meaningfully wade official cook expedition 
arcot suddenly burst laughing 
wanting ten chronometer hours since eaten since outracing light thirty thousand years earth past 
weightlessness free fall makes difficult recognize normally familiar sensations feeling hunger one 
little enough work done great need nourishment ordinary sensation hunger caused lack nourishment empty stomach 
sleep another problem 
restless body permit tired brain sleep though done great deal hard mental work lack physical fatigue made sleep difficult 
usual day space forty hours thirty hour waking periods ten hours sleep 
let eat arcot decided 
afterwards take photographs throw ship high really make time 
two hours later seated control board 
arcot reached threw red switch 
going give half power ten seconds 
air seemed suddenly snapping unprecedented power gone coil became fully charged 
lucky shielded relays arcot muttered 
tremendous surge current set magnetic field turned knives forks wade found intense disgust stopped watches magnetically shielded 
space utterly black slightest hint light 
ten seconds arcot allowed dragged slowly 
last came heavy crashing huge relays current flowed back storage coils space became normal 
alone blackness 
morey dove swiftly observatory 
little see dim glow nebulae millions light years away scarcely visible naked eye despite clarity space 
behind like shining horizon saw mass galaxy first time free observers 
morey began make swift calculations distance come measuring apparent change diameter galaxy 
arcot floated room watched morey made observations began work swiftly pencil paper 
make arcot asked 
mmmmm 
let see 
morey worked moment slide rule 
made good time twenty nine light years ten seconds half power velocity goes cube power doubling power gives us eight times velocity hmmmmmm 
readjusted slide rule slid hairline bit 
make ten million light years little less five days full power 
suggest make another stop six hours 
put us five radii half million light years galaxy 
need take photographs help us retrace steps earth 
right morey arcot agreed 

get photos go 
way think ought watch instruments power room first test full power 
figured make twenty light years per second looks going closer twenty four 
minutes later arcot seated control board flipped intercom power room 
ready morey happened think might good idea pick galaxy start toward 
let wait cautioned morey 
make careful choice distance anyway beyond enlarging power range telectroscope 
another half million light years much better view comparatively short distance take us much way 
wait minute said fuller 
say beyond magnification range telectroscope 
would half million light years ten million make much difference limit amplification tubes arcot replied 
many stages amplification amplifying noise 
whole principle vacuum tube depends electronic emission get much amplification hear every single electron striking plate first tube time thing reaches last amplifying stage words incoming signal weaker minimum noise level first amplifying stage amount amplification give anything noise 
true telectroscope image 
distance light signal galaxies weaker noise level 
get flickering blurred image 
go another half million light years light signal nearer nebulae stronger base noise level full amplification give us good image screen 
fuller nodded 
okay let go additional half million light years 
want take look another galaxy 
right 
arcot turned intercom 
ready morey anytime 
goes said arcot 
pushed little red control 
full power air filled strain flowing energy actually broke spots terrific electrical energy charge 
little snapping sparks air though harmless electrically hot enough give slight burns wade found sorrow 
yike say tell us bring lightning rods asked indignantly small spark snapped way hand 
sorry grinned arcot people know enough stay way things 
seriously though think electrostatic curvature would slow adjust 
see build light rate distortion field curvatures affected 
get gravity magnetic electrostatic field distortion 
see happens leak energy back coil 
busy instruments leave motorman alone morey calling loudly tests 
although ship seemed behaving perfectly wanted check tests make sure relays burned would keep responding properly 
rerouting current around relay arcot checked one one 
finished testing last one fuller yelled 
hey look pointed broad viewport side ship 
far left far right saw two shining ships paralleling course 
shining sleek ships long longitudinal windows glowing white light 
seemed moving exactly speed holding grimly course ancient mariner 
bracketed ship like official guard despite terrific velocity earthmen ship 
arcot stared amazement face suddenly clouded wonder 
morey come power room stared equal wonder 
quickly wade fuller slid ray control seats 
long practice rays made dead shots chosen long ship official ray operators 
lord muttered morey looked ships come vii silently four men watched two ships waiting hostile movement 
long tense moment something happened three totally unprepared 
arcot burst sudden laughter 
ho hoh ho oh shoot cried laughing hard almost impossible understand 
ohoh space curved managed gasp 
moment morey looked puzzled laughing hard arcot 
helplessly wade fuller looked 
suddenly wade caught meaning arcot remark joined two laughter 
right said fuller still mystified half witted physicists recover please let joke knew something mysterious ships looked closely hopes would get point 
saw blinked amazement 
hey ships exact duplicates ancient mariner laughing arcot explained wiping eyes 
four big brave explorers scared shadows light ship come back us due intense curvature space encloses us 
normal space light ray would take hundreds millions years travel way around universe return point origin 
theoretically would possible photograph galaxy thousands millennia ago light left traveled way around curvature space 
space terrific curvature takes fraction second light make trip 
gone way around little cosmos come back 
shot would really done ray beam would go around hit us behind say nice proposition laughed fuller 
accompanied ghosts way goes spirit nine fathoms deep moves ship ghosts work sails 
real ancient mariner trip like famed voyage another way 
men found little passed high speed vast realm space 
chronometer pointed hours exasperating slowness 
six hours elapse first stop seemed many days 
thought trip wonderful adventure soundless continued monotony depressing 
wandered around aimlessly 
wade tried sleep lying strapped bunk half hour gave despair 
arcot saw strain nothing going good little crew decided see could done 
went laboratory looked inspiration 
found 
hey morey wade fuller come got idea called 
came find looking meditatively power pack one flying suits designed 
taken lux metal case looking neat apparatus lay within 
equipped use space suits course morey pointed gives us protection gases 
wonder might install protection mechanical injury intent damage aforethought words equip suits small invisibility apparatus ship might need personal protection 
great idea said wade provided find room case 
think 
need add anything tuning devices really take whale lot power 
arcot pointed places could put also replaced old induction coils one new storage cells got far higher efficiency tubes 
principally something 
indeed thoroughly something six hours almost elapsed realized 
short time returned control room strapped 
arcot reached toward little red switch controlled titanic energies huge coil pulled back quarter way 
go ghosts said 
images quickly disappeared seemingly leaping away terrific speed space ship enclosed opened curvature decreased 
away easing back quarter time prevent sparks flying atmosphere ship arcot cut power zero ship standing still 
hurriedly dived observatory looked eagerly window 
far far behind floating marvelous soft utter blackness space shining disc made myriads glowing points 
seem huge thing great distance simply small glowing object feet outside window 
perfectly clear view lux metal wall black empty space sense distance lost 
seemed miniature model universe tiny thing floated close behind unwavering shining faint light heatless illumination made everything darkened observatory glow faintly 
light three hundred million suns seen distance three million million million miles seemed small nothing compare 
amazingly beautiful thing tiny floating disc light 
morey floated cameras began take pictures 
like take color shot said minutes later would require direct shot reflector telescope time exposure 
ship moving 
enough make difference arcot contradicted 
moving away straight line thing three quintillion miles away 
moving fast enough cause measurable contraction time exposure 
steady platform ship weighs quarter million tons held gyroscopes 
shake 
morey took time exposure arcot looked enlarged image telectroscope tried make angular measurements individual stars 
found impossible 
although could spot betelgeuse antares tremendous radiation close together measurements angle subtended small 
finally decided use distance antares doradus lesser magellanic cloud one two clouds stars float satellites galaxy 
double check used radius galaxy base calculate distance 
distances checked 
ship five hundred thousand light years home necessary observations made swung ship axis looked ahead landing place 
nebulae ahead still invisible naked eye except points telectroscope finally revealed one decidedly nearer rest 
seemed young island universe still vast cloud gas dust stars yet born central whorl single titanic gas cloud stretched million billion miles space 
shall head asked arcot last morey finished observations 
think would good stars hope visit 
well go arcot dived control room morey shut telectroscope put latest photographs file 
suddenly space snapping 
another shock surging energy another ship leaped forward tremendous speed still greater rushing top speed beside ran ghost ships ancient mariner 
morey pushed control room arcot wade fuller getting ready start lab 
quite said 
goal five days away 
suggest stop end four days make accurate measurements plan closer stop 
think ought sleep relays three us awake times 
turn ten hours someone else sleep 
okay agreed meantime three duty went lab work 
arcot finished installation invisibility apparatus suit end ten hours much disappointment 
tested cast something wade morey added finishing touches 
morey came wade finished took another quarter hour took duty shift 
arcot gone library morey work 
fuller come looking something hit upon excellent idea fixing meal 
begun preparations kitchen suddenly ancient mariner gave violent leap men expecting weight suddenly fell different ways terrific force fuller fell half length galley knocked blow 
wade asleep bed awakened violently shock morey strapped chair badly shaken 
everyone cried simultaneously arcot way control room 
first shock forerunner storm 
suddenly ship hurled violently air shot great burning sparks snapping hiss electricity everywhere every pointed metal object throwing streamers blue electric flame air ship rocked heaved cavorted wildly though caught play titanic forces scrambling wildly along hand holds arcot made way towards control room one side wildly variable acceleration shook ship 
doggedly worked way frequently getting severe burns flaming sparks 
power room relays crashing wildly 
suddenly new sound added arcot pulled control chair strapped 
radiation detector buzzed screaming warning cosmic rays arcot yelled 
high concentration slapped switch shot heavy relux screens across every window ship 
sudden crash fuse went fuse made silver bar two feet thick instant flames burning sparks flared died 
ship cavorted madly shaking mightily titanic cosmic forces surrounded forces made highest energy form universe arcot knew nothing could done power coil 
drained circuit broken 
shifted molecular drive pushing acceleration four gravities high men could stand 
still powerful ship tossed plaything inconceivable forces 
lived forces try turn ship violently strength ship nothing could resist awful power around 
guide arcot used compass gyroscope one twisted far original position managed steer fairly straight course 
meanwhile power room wade morey working frantically get space strain drive coil recharged 
despite strength sapping strain working four gravities acceleration managed get auxiliary power unit operation 
moments pouring energies coil bank could charge central drive coil 
another silver bar fuse inserted wade checked relays make sure working order 
fuller regained consciousness worked way laboriously power room carrying three space suits 
stopped lab get power belts three men quickly donned help overcome four gravity pull 
another half hour sped bucking ship forced way terrific field space 
suddenly felt terrific jolt ship moving smoothly gradually calm 
got power space strain drive yet arcot called intercom 
enough morey cried 
try arcot cut molecular motion drive threw space control power 
ship suddenly supercharged energy 
jarred suddenly quiet 
allowed ten minutes pass cut drive allowed ship go free fall 
morey voice came intercom 
arcot things really busted haywire half drive together 
right 
every instrument ship seems kilter good thing plenty spare parts smaller relays burned completely several power leads fused load forced 
space strain drive leaking energy terrific rate without repair could function much longer 
power room arcot surveyed damage 
well boys better get work 
stranded get drive repaired viii forty hours later arcot running ship smoothly top speed 
four men gone bed thirty hours hard work 
coupled exhaustion working four gravities ship going storm enough make sleep soundly 
arcot awakened others turned drive resetting course 
done little time began hang heavily arcot hands 
decided make thorough inspection hull others awoke 
terrific strain might opened cracks lux metal hull would detectable inside inner wall separated outer envelope 
accordingly got spacesuits making sure oxygen tanks full ready 
went library got books set calculations mind 
morey woke hours later found arcot still work calculations 
hey said swinging chair beside arcot thought lookout cosmic rays curious delusion asked arcot blandly 
matter fact busy figuring 
think chance meeting another region one million million million million 
considering chances think need worry 
see ever met one chances hitting one better hitting two 
fuller stuck head door 
oh said already well wonder one could tell hit busy chance think 
take chance grinned morey 
might strain brain 
please fuller pleaded wincing 
breakfast 
explain storm 
simply came region space cosmic rays created explained arcot 
fuller frowned 
nothing generate cosmic rays arcot nodded 
true 
think know real source believe merely say created 
want work 
idea energy source greater universe confirmed 
rate created space perfect vacuum space distorted terrifically titanic forces work 
bent twisted far normal even curvature bumpy spot space threw us 
first entered using space strain drive space around ship distorted conflicted region cosmic ray generation ship lost 
curvature space ship caused sometimes reinforced sometimes canceled twisted space around tremendous surges current back forth main power coil storage coils caused electric discharges kept burning air 
notice got burns 
field caused terrific surges current magnetic field caused walls ship heat due generation electric current walls 
fuller looked around walls ship 
well ancient mariner sure took beating 
matter fact worried said arcot 
strong hull might easily strained field terrific force 
happened hit two space waves might given acceleration two different directions would strain walls force amounting thousands tons 
laid suits front think might reasonably get take look old boat 
wade gets well well speak devil look energetic wade huge body floating library door 
yawning sleepily rubbing eyes 
evident yet washed growing beard heavy black cheeks testified need shave 
others shaved coming library 
wade said arcot going outside someone operate airlock 
suppose get work hirsute adornment atomic hydrogen cutting torch lab use wish 
rest us going outside 
arcot voice became serious 
way try little jokes like starting little acceleration 
think would got good sense like make certain 
left behind never find us vast immensity intergalactic space 
pleasant idea contemplate 
suits radio communication ship would carry hundred miles 
mere step space wade shook head grinning 
desire left ship thank 
need worry 
minutes later arcot morey fuller stepped airlock set work using power flashlights examine outer hull signs possible strain 
flashlights equipped storage coils power actually powerful searchlights airlessness space rays absolutely invisible 
could seen hit relux inner wall angle reflected directly observer eyes 
lux metal wall transparent naturally invisible smooth relux reflecting one hundred percent incident light become illuminated illumination result scattering light 
necessary look closely pass beams every square inch surface 
however crack would rough hence would scatter light even readily visible otherwise 
great relief hour half careful inspection none found signs crack went back ship resume voyage 
hurled space twin ghost ships following closely 
hour hour ship went 
something else 
work calculating problems arcot suggested connection velocities motion observed stars edge island universe approaching 
since stars revolved mass entire galaxy possible calculate mass entire universe averaging values several stars 
results exact reliable enough 
found universe mass two hundred fifty million suns little less home galaxy 
average sized nebula 
still hours dragged came gradually nearer goal gradually despite speed twenty four light years per second end second day trouble cosmic ray field stopped observation 
near island universe stars spread huge disc ahead 
three hundred thousand light years distant guess said morey 
know velocity fairly accurately said wade 
calculate distance two stars go good idea agreed arcot 
take angle morey swing ship 
taking measurements advanced one hour 
knowing distance experience able calculate diameter galaxy 
turned order ninety thousand light years 
much closer seemed indeed edge giant universe 
thousands stars flamed bright stretching across horizon galaxy eyes men never seen close range galaxy yet condensed entirely stars heart still remained vast gas cloud would eventually stars planets 
vast misty cloud plainly visible glowing milky light like vast frosted light bulb 
impossible conceive size thing looked like model still quarter million light years 
morey looked calculations 
think three hours 
suppose go full speed two hours change low speed astronomical boss morey said arcot 
let go swung ship started 
drew nearer new universe began feel interest trip 
things beginning happen ship plunged ahead full speed two hours 
could see nothing velocity except two ghost ships ever present companions 
stopped 
saw great suns shining 
one close could see disc naked eye 
could see clearly entire sky misty stars close blotted 
room seemed grow warm 
hey calculations called arcot 
getting suddenly air snapped traveling low speed drive space strain apparatus 
entire space lit dim violet glow 
ten minutes glow gone arcot cut drive 
ordinary dark space star studded blackness 
matter calculations morey wanted know 
oh nothing much arcot said casually 
thirty thousand light years 
landed right middle central gas cloud plowing relative velocity around sixteen thousand miles per second wonder got hot lucky come near stars process could recharge coil 
wonder burn velocity said fuller 
gas dense enough arcot explained 
gas better vacuum best pump could give earth fewer molecules per cubic inch radio tube 
let see find planet 
need take photographs going want find star take photos leave 
want find would waste film 
leave morey find star want 
morey set work telescope trying find nearest star spectral type g agreed upon 
also wanted find one magnitude brilliance 
last investigating several suns discovered one seemed fulfill wishes 
ship turned started toward adventure really hoped find 
rushed space distorted stars shining vividly saw one goal 
bright slowly changing violet point cross hairs aiming telescope 
far asked arcot 
thirty light centuries replied morey watching star eagerly 
drove silence 
suddenly morey cried look gone happened asked arcot surprise 
morey rubbed chin thought 
star suddenly flared brightly instant disappeared 
evidently g giant burned hydrogen stars normally use fuel 
happens star begins collapse increasing brilliance due heat generated gas falling toward center star 
nuclear reactions begin take place due increased transparency star supernova produced 
star blows away gaseous envelope leaving superdense core 
words leaves white dwarf 
paused looked arcot 
wonder star planets knew meant 
probable fate beings whose sun suddenly collapsed tiny relatively cold point sky suddenly loomed dim bulk star disc already arcot snapped ship molecular motion drive 
knew must close 
angry disc flaming white star 
arcot swung ship bit one side running close flaming star 
exceedingly hot despite high temperature intense radiation radiating surface small 
swung star parabolic orbit velocity sun could hold planetary orbit 
velocity relative star pretty high arcot announced 
swinging close use star attraction brake 
distance six gravities add molecular drive braking four gravities 
suppose look around see planets 
break free head another star even ten gravities deceleration took several hours reduce speed point would make possible head planet tiny sun 
morey went observatory swept sky telectroscope 
difficult find planets reflected light weak star dim finally found one 
took angular readings central sun 
little later took readings 
changing velocity ship readings accurate calculations showed several hundred million miles 
decelerating rapidly soon momentum reduced less four miles second 
reached planet arcot threw ship orbit around began spiral 
clear lux windows control room men looked upon bleak frozen world 
ix ship lay unfamiliar panorama unknown world circled frozen around dim unknown sun far space 
cold bleak low rolling hills black bare rock coated spots white sheen appeared snow though men realized must frozen air 
ran strange rivers deep blue poured great lakes seas blue liquid 
mighty mountains deep blue crystal looming high hollows cracks crystal mountains lay silent motionless seas deep blue unruffled breeze airless world 
world lay frozen dim dead sun 
continued broad sweep level crystalline plain bleak rock disappeared behind 
world ten thousand miles diameter surface gravity quarter greater earth 
swept swinging planet altitude less thousand feet viewing unutterably desolate scene cold dead world 
ahead loomed bleak dark mass rock 
crossed frozen ocean coming land land solid sea 
everywhere lay deep drifts snow valleys ran streams bright blue 
look cried morey sudden surprise 
far ahead left loomed strange formation jutting vertical columns covered white burden snow 
arcot turned powerful searchlight stood brightly vast snowfield 
dead frozen city 
looked arcot turned ship headed without word 
hard realize enormity catastrophe brought cold bleak death population world death intelligent race 
arcot finally spoke 
land ship 
think safe us leave 
get suits make sure tanks charged heaters working 
colder space 
cooled radiation streams probably liquid nitrogen oxygen argon slight atmosphere hydrogen helium neon cooled fifty degrees absolute 
cooled conduction convection 
others got suits ready lowered ship gently snowy ground 
sank nearly ten feet snow 
turned powerful searchlight swept around ship 
warm beams frozen gasses evaporated moments cleared area around ship 
morey others came back suits 
arcot donned adjusted weight ten pounds molecular power unit 
short time later stepped airlock onto ice field frozen world 
high glowed dim blue white disc tiny sun looking like little bright star 
adjusting controls suits four men lifted tenuous air headed toward city moving easily ten feet frozen wastes snow field 
thing understand morey said shot toward city planet 
intense radiation sun went supernova vaporized arcot pointed toward tall oddly shaped antenna rose highest building city 
answer 
antenna similar found planets black star heat screen 
probably antennas planet 
unfortunately screen efficiency goes fourth power temperature 
could keep terrific heat supernova keep heat planet supernova died 
planet cool make screen work efficiently last came outskirts dead city 
vertical walls buildings free snow could see blank staring eyes windows within bleak empty rooms 
swept frozen streets came one huge building center 
doors bronze closed windows could see room piled high sort insulating material evidently used last ditch attempt keep freezing cold 
shall break asked arcot 
may well morey voice answered radio 
may records could take back earth deciphered 
time like imagine would leave records hoping race might come find 
worked molecular ray pistols fifteen minutes tearing way 
slow work use heat ray pistols supply necessary energy molecular motion 
finally broke found entered second floor deep snow buried first 
stretched long richly decorated hall painted great colored murals 
paintings displayed people dressed suit soft white cloth blond hair reached shoulders 
shorter heavily built earthmen perhaps grace denied greater gravity planet 
murals portrayed world warm sunlight green plants tall trees waving breeze breeze air lay frozen stone floors buildings 
scene scene saw came great hall 
saw hundreds bodies people wrapped heavy cloth blankets 
floor room lay little crystals green 
wade looked little crystals long time people lay perfectly preserved utter cold 
seemed sleeping men women children sleeping blanket soft snow evaporated disappeared energy lights fell 
one little group men looked left room death 
three young man fair blonde young woman seemed scarcely girl little child 
sleeping arms warm arms death kindly reliever pain 
arcot turned rose flying swiftly long corridor toward door 
meant us said 
let leave 
others followed 
let see records left went 
may wanted us know tragic story 
let see sort civilization 
chemistry good least said wade 
notice green crystals quick painless poison gas relieve struggle cold 
went first floor level single great court 
pillars vast smooth floor 
good architecture said morey 
pillars vast load building 
load even greater gravity remarked arcot 
center room great golden bronze globe resting platform marble 
must new world froze sign corrosion oxidation 
men flew stood beside looking great sphere nearly fifteen feet diameter 
globe world said fuller looking interest 
yes agreed arcot set sure cold would come looks 
let take look 
flew top viewed 
whole globe carefully chiseled relief map showing seas mountains continents 
arcot come minute called morey 
arcot dropped morey looking globe 
edge one continents small raised globe around globe circle etched 
think meant represent globe morey said 
almost certain represents spot 
look 
pointed spot according scale globe five thousand miles away 
projecting surface bronze globe little silver tower 
want us go continued morey 
erected shortly catastrophe must put relics want us get 
must guessed eventually intelligent beings would cross space imagine maps like every large city 
think duty visit cairn 
quite agree assented arcot 
chance men visiting world infinitely small 
let leave city dead said wade 
gave sense depression greater inspired vast loneliness space 
one never lonely dead men began realize original ancient mariner lonely strange companions depths ten million light years space 
went back ship floating last remnants world atmosphere back chill frozen gases cheering warm interior ship 
contrast made appreciate fully gift hot blazing sun really 
perhaps made fuller ask happened star much like sun happen sol perhaps may said morey softly 
eternal optimism man keeps us saying happen 
besides put hand wall ship ever worry anything like 
ships like take us new sun new planet 
arcot lifted ship flew cold frozen ground beneath following route indicated great globe dead city 
mile mile frozen ice fields flew shot three miles per second 
suddenly bleak bulk huge mountain loomed gigantic 
arcot reversed power brought ship stop 
powerful searchlight swept area looking tower knew 
last made pyramid rather tower coated ice 
soon thawed frozen gasses playing energy three powerful searchlights upon minutes glint gold showed melting ice show 
looks said wade though outer wall gold strong wall iron steel protect corrosion 
certainly gold enough tensile strength hold gravity masses 
arcot brought ship beside tower men went airlock cold almost airless world 
flew across pyramid looked means entrance 
several places noticed hieroglyphics carved great foot high characters 
searched vain door noticed pyramid perfect truncated leaving flat area top 
joint walls seemed handle visible methods opening door 
arcot turned powerful light surface searched carefully opening device 
found bas relief engraving hand pointing corner door 
looked closely found small jewel like lens set metal 
suddenly men felt vibration heavy click door panel began drop slowly 
get arcot cried 
always break way trapped four men leaped sank slowly 
massive walls tower nearly five feet thick made tough white metal 
pure iron diagnosed wade 
perhaps silicon iron alloy 
strong steel resistant corrosion 
elevator stopped found great chamber obviously museum lost race 
around walls arranged models books diagrams 
never hope take ship said arcot looking great collection 
look old winged airplane steam engine electric motor thing looks like kind electric battery 
take stuff objected fuller 
morey agreed 
think best bet would take books making sure get introductory ones read language 
see marked shelves single vertical mark 
ones next two vertical marks next ones three 
suggest load books take ship 
rest agreed began carrying armloads books flying top pyramid ship back 
instead flying back pyramid last load arcot announced going leave note anyone might come later 
others went back last load worked drawing note 
let see masterpiece said morey three men returned ship last books 
arcot used piece tough heavy plastic would resist corrosion cold almost airless world might offer 
near top drawn representation ship beneath representation route taken universe universe 
galaxy represented cloud gas main identifying feature 
underneath dotted line route space printed u 
followed little table 
numeral followed straight bar followed two bars ten 
ten represented ten bars addition shaped sign 
twenty next followed twenty bars two shaped signs 
thus worked 
system used would make clear reasoning creature used decimal system zeroes meant ten times 
next drawn planetary system frozen world distance planet central sun labeled u 
thus finders could reason come distance two hundred billion units distance three hundred million miles taken unit come another galaxy 
certainly creature enough intelligence reach frozen world would understand since year planet approximately eight times arcot continued indicating came approximately five hundred years catastrophe 
pointed several drawings 
left message tower arcot closed door leaving pyramid exactly come 
say morey commented open close door anyway arcot grinned 
notice jewel corner lens photoelectric cell 
flashlight opened door 
figure worked accidentally 
morey raised eyebrow 
darned thing simple creature intelligent might able get destroy records arcot looked 
savages going come none planet anyone intelligent enough build spaceship going destroy contents tower 
oh 
morey looked little sheepish 
went airlock took suits 
began packing precious books specimen cases brought purpose preserving things 
last carefully stowed returned control room 
looked silently across strange dead world thinking much must like earth 
dead frozen forever 
low hills stretched beneath dimly lighted weak rays shrunken sun 
three hundred million miles away glowed weakly world received little heat might received small coal fire mile away 
weakly flared thin atmosphere hydrogen helium little corona glowed plainly even stars around shone brilliantly 
men could see one constellation grouped outlines dragon sun system cold baleful eye 
gradually arcot lifted ship headed space could see dim frozen plains fall behind 
load oppressing loneliness parted flew vast spaces eternal stars 
x arcot looked speculatively star field great broad window 
want find another g sun naturally think ought go directly 
lot backtracking get back dead star 
suggest go back edge galaxy taking pictures way future investigators come directly 
take hours 
think right agreed morey 
besides give us wider choice stars pick next g 
let get going 
arcot moved red switch ship shot away half speed 
watched green image white dwarf fade suddenly flare become bright outraced light left five centuries 
stopped took photographs path could marked 
stopped every light century reached point star merely dim point almost lost myriad stars around 
edge galaxy went toward universe 
arcot morey called let go say one million light years space angle galaxy see get galaxies one plate 
make navigation easier 
good idea 
get back one day time count back earth anyway 
since would travel space strain time would count earth time 
arcot pushed red control way forward ship began move top velocity twenty four light years per second 
hours dragged heavily coming arcot remained alone watch others went rooms sleep strapping weightless bodies securely bunks 
hours later morey awoke sudden premonition trouble 
looked chronometer wall slept twelve hours gone beyond million light year mark matter except showed something happened arcot 
something 
arcot sound asleep middle library exactly middle floating room ten feet wall 
morey called arcot awoke guilty start 
fine sentry make said morey caustically 
even keep awake sit see run anything 
gone million light years already still going strong 
come snap sorry apologize know slept perfectly quiet except deep toned musical snores help grinned arcot 
get stop 
get nothing morey snapped 
stay right call others decide done sleeping sentry 
morey turned left wake others 
awakened wade told happened way wake fuller suddenly air ship crackled around space changing coming hyperspace amazement morey wade looked 
knew arcot still floating helplessly middle room hold brainless apes turning around came arcot voice full suppressed mirth 
suddenly plastered wall ship four gravities acceleration unable walk could crawl laboriously toward control room calling arcot shut power 
morey left stranded library arcot decided high time got floor 
quickly looked around means 
near floating air book reading reach 
taken boots started read fuller rocket method 
seemed hopeless 
suddenly came inspiration quickly slipped shirt began waving violently air 
developed velocity two inches second fast fast enough 
time put shirt back reached wall 
easy shoot door corridor control room without seen morey wade room 
wade morey reached doorway control room arcot decided time shut power 
men laboring eight hundred pounds weight suddenly weightless 
strength powerful muscles expended hurling far wall 
complaints loud finally simmered earnest demand know devil arcot managed get dead center 
easy said airily 
turned little power fell influence weight easy get control room 
come wade demanded 
truth get pushed 
yes doubt 
get hold anything push took handful air threw away reached wall 
oh course hold air took air threw away reached wall 
could learn 
arcot going keep system secret seemed 
rate arcot continued back control room belong observatory belong 
get territory morey pushed back observatory minutes voice came intercom 
let move bit arcot 
still get galaxies plate 
let go another hour take pictures point 
fuller awakened come meantime wanted know take pictures spot 
point said morey 
ones took coming want wide angle shot 
arcot threw space strain drive headed top speed 
control room watching instruments joking principally latter happened 
one instant moving smoothly weightlessly along 
next instant ship rocked though struck violently air snapping inferno shooting sparks came sharp crash suddenly volatilized silver bar main power fuse 
simultaneously hurled forward terrific force straps held place creaked sudden strain men felt weak faint 
consciousness nearly left burned dozen places leaping sparks 

except ghost ships longer followed ancient mariner seemed unchanged 
around could see dim glowing galaxies 
brother came near something arcot cried 
may wandering star take look around quick dark space seemed utterly empty around coasted weightless space 
arcot snapped lights control room moment eyes become accustomed dim lights 
dead ahead 
dull red glow dim scarcely visible 
arcot realized dead star 
morey said 
dead star directly ahead us good god close falling straight toward dim red bulk 
far fuller asked 
least several million morey began 
looked distance recorded meteor detector 
arcot heaven sake something thing hundred miles away one thing arcot said tightly 
never hope avoid thing got power 
going try orbit around 
fall toward give ship acceleration take 
time calculate pile speed fall 
others strapped control chairs prepared acceleration come 
ancient mariner dropped toward star infinite distance arcot could applied enough power put ship hyperbolic orbit would carried past star 
come space drive gotten fairly close gravitational field drained power main coil space field broken started accelerate toward star 
velocity would great enough form escape orbit 
even would fall far short enough velocity get elliptical orbit unless used molecular drive 
arcot headed toward one edge star poured power molecular drive 
ship shot forward additional five half gravities acceleration 
velocity five thousand miles per second entered hyperspace swiftly adding original velocity 
course feel pull sun since free fall field could feel five half gravities molecular drive 
able experience pull star would crushed weight 
speed mounting drew nearer star arcot forcing ship additional power could get 
knew hope get ship closed ellipse around star closed ellipse meant would forever bound star planet helpless even titanic power ancient mariner could enable escape dull red dead sun ballooned toward arcot said think make orbit right going awfully close surface thing others quiet merely watched arcot star arcot made swift movements controls could establish orbit would fairly safe 
seemed like eternity five half gravities acceleration held men chairs almost well straps antiacceleration units bound 
man weighs better half ton feel like moving much 
fuller whispered morey corner sagging mouth 
earth mean space thing within hundred miles said must pretty small 
could pull us around like dead white dwarf black dwarf might say morey replied 
density matter increases volume star depends less less temperature 
dwarf mass sun temperature effect negligible action forces within electron nucleon gas makes star reigns supreme 
shown white dwarf black one increased mass begins decrease sharply volume certain point reached 
fact cold star exist volume greater one half times mass sun mass increases pressure goes star shrinks volume degenerate matter 
little better 
times mass sun sun mean old sol star would theoretically collapse point 
almost happened case 
actual limit star reached density neutron star collapsed far long shot 
star forty kilometers less twenty five miles diameter took nearly two hours careful juggling get orbit arcot considered reasonably circular 
finally wade looked sky shouted say look streaks arcing surface dull red plain going ship several dim streaks light across sky 
one brighter rest bright white streak 
streaks move seemed painted sky overhead glowing bands unwavering light 
said arcot nebulae 
wide streak one left 
bright streak must nearby star 
look like streaks moving fast small orbit 
pointed red star beneath 
less twenty miles center thing almost exactly thirty kilometers center ten kilometers surface great mass orbital velocity something terrific going around thing better three hundred times every second year three milliseconds long orbital velocity seven hundred thousand kilometers per second moving along fifth speed light safe orbit fuller asked 
safe enough said arcot bitterly 
damned safe see ever break free 
pull away power ship 
trapped well worn working gravity let eat get sleep 
feel like sleeping said fuller 
may call safe would take instant fall surface thing 
looked inert titanically powerful enemy whose baleful glow seemed even burning funeral pyre 
well said arcot falling flying space two things worry 
started toward falling velocity would increase result bounce right back 
magnitude force required make us fall sun appalling gravitational pull us amounts five billion tons equalized centrifugal force orbital velocity 
tendency change would like trying bend spring much resistance 
require tremendous force make us either fall star get away 
escape lift ship gravity 
means lift five million tons mass 
get farther weight decrease gravitational attraction drops would need vast amounts energy beyond human conception 
burned two tons matter recharging coils using another two tons recharge 
need least four tons spare started twenty 
simply got fuel enough break loose star gravitational hold vast energy matter 
let eat sleep problem 
wade cooked meal ate silence trying think way dilemma 
tried sleep problem arcot suggested difficult relax 
physically tired gone great strains even short time maneuvering tired 
pull five times greater normal gravity tired one fifth time would one gravity brains still wide awake trying think way way get away dark sun 
last sleep came 
xi morey thought first waken seven hours later dressed dove lightly noiselessly library 
suddenly noticed telectroscope operation heard low hum smoothly working director motors 
turned headed back toward observatory 
arcot busy telectroscope 
arcot demanded 
arcot looked dusted hands 
gimmicking telectroscope 
going around dead dwarf every three milliseconds makes awfully hard see stars around us 
put cutoff shut telectroscope time looks sky every three milliseconds 
result get picture going around us easily 
steady picture since getting still picture three hundred times second better moving picture film ever projected far accuracy concerned 
want take look bright streak sky 
think means salvation 
morey nodded 
see mean another white dwarf likely use escape 
think see driving 
work arcot said coolly profit example people left back 
suicide preferable dying cold 
morey nodded 
question helpless depends entirely star let see get focus 
orbital velocity ship focussing star indeed difficult thing 
took well hour get image centered screen without drifting toward one edge took even longer get focus close enough sphere give definite reading instruments 
image started streak taking smaller smaller sections streak proper times managed get good solid image 
get bright enough another problem picking fraction light amplified greatly make visible image 
finally got looking morey gazed steadily image 
job figure distance 
got much parallax work 
compute timing blinker system opposite sides orbit think arcot said 
went work problem 
fuller wade showed given work morey gave equations solve without telling figures applied 
finally arcot said period common center gravity thirty nine hours figure 
morey nodded 
check 
gives us distance two million miles apart 
two asked fuller 
good another star one interested freak underneath us 
arcot corrected interested getting away one beneath us entirely different matter 
midway star one gravitational effects two would canceled since would pulled hard one direction 
free pulls could escape could get neutral area long enough turn space strain drive could get away fast 
course lot energy would eaten get away 
hope arcot concluded 
yes whale hope wade snorted sarcastically 
going get point halfway two stars enough power lift ship miles mahomet go mountain misquoted arcot mountain must come mahomet 
going wade asked exasperation 
beat joshua made sun stand still job throwing around agreed arcot quietly intend throw star way escape twin fields escape hammer anvil millions millions millions tons matter crash 
intend swing asked wade awe thought spectacle would two suns fell 
well want around 
choice arcot grinned 
face grew serious 
want simple 
molecular ray 
stars hot 
fall rotating 
suppose rotation stopped stopped suddenly completely molecular ray acts catalytically supply power stop star star 
cause molecules move direction opposite rotation 
supply impulse star supply energy job break away stars get close enough really going hitch wagon star mechanics job simple 
calculate long use power quickly escape 
use main power board generate ray project instead little ray units 
luck ought free star three days work started 
chance life sight every intention taking advantage calculating machines brought would certainly prove worth mass one use 
observations extremely difficult ship rocketing around star rapid orbit 
calculations mass distance orbital motion star therefore difficult final results looked good 
star one formed binary two slightly different mass rotating distance roughly two million miles 
next problem calculate time fall point assuming would stop instantaneously would approximately true 
actual fall would take seven hours tremendous acceleration two masses since stars would fall toward ship would drawn toward falling mass since orbit around star took fraction second complete make sure right position halfway point collision occurred 
also orbit would greatly perturbed star approached necessary calculate 
arcot calculated twenty two hours forty six minutes would favorable position start fall 
could started sooner changes made wiring ship could start using molecular ray full power 
well said wade finally finished laborious computations hope make mistake get caught two happens find stopped star hit exactly first time morley replied juggle ray 
set work installing heavy leads ray projectors outside hull countersunk recesses 
morey wade go outside ship help attach cables 
space floating ship still weightless supported centrifugal force 
work readjusting projectors greater power completed hour quarter still left twenty hours could use 
next ten hours charged great storage coils capacity leaving circuits open controlled relays 
would keep coils charged ready start 
finally wade dusted hands said ready go mechanically think would wise ready physically 
know tired sit around suspense nervous cats time comes 
suggest take couple sleeping tablets turn 
use mild shock awaken us oversleep 
others agreed plan prepared wait 
awakened two hours actual moment action wade prepared breakfast morey took observations 
knew star according calculations looked 
breathed sigh relief exactly place mathematics sure rapidly moving machine exceedingly difficult make good observations 
two hours seemed drag interminably last arcot signalled full power molecular rays 
waited breathlessly response 
nearly twenty seconds later sun went 
said wade hushed voice 
almost shock realize ship power enough extinguish sun arcot morey awed time 
things fast 
checked time required see white dwarf gone 
half gave distance star light seconds 
screen already rigged flash information computer turn gave time signal robot pilot would turn drive precisely right instant 
time human error velocities great time error small 
waited 
wait seven hours spinning dizzily around improbably tiny star equally improbably titanic gravitational field 
star couple dozens miles across yet dense weighed half million times much earth wait another star like chilled absolute zero fell toward wish could stay around see splash arcot said 
going something see 
kinetic energy two masses slamming going blaze light really something wade looking nervously telectroscope plate 
wish could see sun 
like idea thing big creeping us dark 
calm morey said quietly 
hands took chance chance take 
want watch something watch junior 
going start pretty interesting tricks 
dense black sun approached junior morey called begin tricks 
first seemed optical effects though eye playing tricks 
red glowing ball beneath began grow transparent around surface leaving opaque red core seemed shrinking slowly 
happening fuller asked 
orbit around star becoming elliptical arcot replied 
sun pulls us star beneath us grows smaller distance begin fall back toward grows larger 
since taking place many hundreds times per second visual pictures seem blend together 
watch clock morey said suddenly pointing 
men watched tensely hand moved slowly around 
ten nine eight seven six five four three two one zero relay slammed home almost instantaneously everyone ship slammed unconsciousness 
xii hours later arcot regained consciousness 
quiet ship 
still strapped seat control room 
relux screens place perfectly peaceful 
know whether ship motionless racing space speed faster light first semiconscious impulse see 
reached arm seemed made dry dust ready crumble arm would behave 
nerves jumping wildly 
pulled switch seeking relux screens dropped motors pulled back 
hyperspace beside rode twin ghost ships 
arcot looked around trying decide brain clogged 
felt tired wanted sleep 
scarcely able think dragged others rooms strapped bunks 
strapped fell asleep almost 
still hours passed arcot waking slowly insistent shaking morey 
hey arcot wake arcot hey arcot ears sent message brain brain tried ignore 
last slowly opened eyes 
huh said low tired voice 
thank god know whether alive 
none us remembered going bed 
decided must carried us sure looked dead 
uhuh came arcot unenthusiastic rejoinder 
boy sleepy said wade drifted room 
use wet cloth cold water morey 
brisk application cold water brought arcot nearly awake 
immediately clamored wherewithal fill aching void making painfully felt midsection 
right laughed wade 
appetite healthy ever already prepared meal arcot promptly hustled galley 
strapped chair could eat comfortably looked around others 
devil replied morey seriously wanted ask 
beginnings idea 
slept two days told far island universes tell one another 
idea 
stopped ship floating 
sure know happened hoped might idea 
idea said arcot 
hungry wait eaten talk 
fell food 
eating went control room found every gyroscope place thrown place attractions passed 
looked around meters coils 
obvious happened 
attempt escape successful shot stars space 
energy drained power coil expected 
power plant automatically cut recharging coils two hours 
drive come ship flashed space 
gyroscopes erratic way knowing direction come lost space well lots galaxies go said arcot 
ought able find nice one stay get home 
sure wade replied like earth passed caused arcot arcot shrugged 
sure know 
theory double gravitational field plus power field produced sort cross product effected brains 
rate 
certainly agreed morey 
possibly back track identify universe 
identifying features enable us recognize galaxy two satellites greater lesser magellanic clouds 
spent ten years photographing studying comparing photographs already might find 
know system locate galaxy time 
suggestions came visit planets asked arcot 
chance chance getting home far see 
go galaxy neighborhood within twenty thirty million light years look planet high degree civilization 
give photographs ask knowledge galaxy two satellites 
keep trying find race learned research 
think easiest quickest satisfactory method 
think obvious choice agreed 
next proposition select galaxy 
go one wish said morey moving thirty thousand miles per second would take us quite slow stop go direction 
nice big galactic nebula right front us three days away six million light years 
objections heading rest looked glowing point nebula 
space star hard brilliant dimensionless point light 
nebula glows faint mistiness far away never bright glow stars vast dimensions great even across millions light years space appear tiny glowing discs faint indistinct edges 
men looked clear lux metal windows saw tiny blur light soft black curtain space 
good course ship inertia recommended redirect ship greater accuracy 
setting damaged gyroscopes came first however 
number things ship needed readjustment replacement strain escaping giant star 
made thorough inspection arcot said think best make repairs 
flame hit us burned outside microphone speaker probably lot damage ray projectors 
rather land planet unarmed chances fifty fifty greeted open cannon muzzles instead open arms 
work inside left arcot fuller morey wade put spacesuits went onto hull 
found surprisingly little damage far less expected 
true loudspeaker microphone instruments made ordinary matter burned clean 
even clean spaces recessed wall 
temperature ten thousand degrees metals boiled away even tungsten boils seven thousand degrees normal matter boils even easily 
ray projectors adjusted high power necessary stop sun orbit readjusted normal power heat beams replaced 
nearly four hours work everything checked relays switch points instruments gyroscopes 
stock taken found running low replacement parts 
anything happened would stop using machinery break spare parts 
original supply twenty tons lead fuel ten tons metal left lead common metal could easily pick planet might visit 
could also get fresh supply water refill air tanks 
ship perfect condition ever every bearing put condition generators gyroscopes running smoothly 
threw ship full speed headed galaxy ahead 
going look intelligent beings arcot reminded others communicate 
suggest practice telepathic processes showed need 
time passed rapidly something 
spent considerable part reading books telepathy arcot brought practicing 
end second day trip morey fuller peculiarly adaptable minds able converse readily rapidly fuller projecting morey receiving 
wade divided time equally projecting reading result could neither well 
early fourth day entered universe toward heading 
stopped half million light years decided large local cluster brilliant suns promised best results since stars closer together many yellow g type seeking 
penetrated galaxy far safe using half speed lower speeds worked toward local cluster 
arcot cut drive several light years nearest sun 
well wanted morey pick us g star 
await royal command move 
minutes telectroscope morey pointed one pinpoints light gleamed brightly sky 
one looks like best bet 
g little brighter sol 
morey swung ship pointing axis ship direction line flight 
observatory leading ship turned normal position 
shot forward using space strain drive full hour one sixteenth power 
arcot cut drive disc sun large 
going job cutting velocity traveling pretty fast relative sun arcot told others 
velocity great sun seem swerve greatly rushed nearer 
arcot began use molecular drive brake ship 
morey busy telectroscope although greatly hampered fact feat strength hold arm right angles body ten seconds heavy acceleration arcot applying 
method works called morey suddenly 
fuller system finding planets picked another winner circle sun get better look arcot already trying vainly decrease velocity figure would permit attraction sun hold grip allow land planet 
figure arcot said need plenty time come rest 
think morey morey punched figures calculator 
wow somewhere neighborhood hundred days using acceleration safe five gravities reducing present velocity twenty five thousand miles per second zero take approximately twenty four hundred hours one hundred days use gravitational attraction sun help us 
use space control said arcot 
move close sun space control energy fall used overcoming space strain coil field thus prevent falling 
start move away climbing gravity aid us stopping 
even take us three days stop 
get anywhere using molecular power giant sun damned generous energy fall started cycles arcot predicted took full three days constant slowing accomplish purpose burning nearly three tons matter 
constantly oppressed load five gravities except short intervals stopped eat moving space control field 
even sleeping forced stand load 
massive sun principal effective brake 
time go dozen million miles primary intense gravity better effect got 
morey divided time piloting ship arcot rested observing system 
end third day made creditable progress map 
located six planets certain others 
sake simplicity assumed circular orbits calculated approximate orbital velocities distance sun 
determined mass sun direct weighings aboard ship 
soon fair diagram system constructed mathematically experimental observation showed close approximation 
planets rather massive sol 
innermost planet third diameter mercury four million miles farther primary 
named hermes 
next one named aphrodite greek goddess corresponding roman venus little larger venus eight million miles farther primary seventy five million miles central sun 
next morey called terra much like earth 
distance hundred twenty four million miles sun must received almost amount heat earth sun considerably brighter sol 
terra eight thousand two hundred miles diameter fairly clear atmosphere varying albedo indicated clouds atmosphere 
morey every reason believe might inhabited proof photographs consistently poor due glare sun 
rest planets proved little interest 
place according bode law another planet corresponding mars belt asteroids 
beyond still another belt 
side double asteroid belt fourth planet fifty thousand mile diameter methane ammonia giant morey named zeus honor jupiter 
picked couple others plates able tell anything yet 
case planets aphrodite terra far interesting 
think picked right angle come system said arcot looking morey photographs wide bands asteroids 
come planetary group right angles plane ecliptic allowed miss asteroid belts 
started moving toward planet terra reaching objective less three hours 
globe beneath lit brightly approached daylight side 
could see wide green plains gently rolling mountains great cleft one mountain ranges shimmering lake clearest blue 
air planet screamed dropped roar loudspeaker grew mighty cataract sound 
morey turned volume 
sparkling little lake passed beneath shot seventy five miles surface planet 
first entered atmosphere impression looking vast inverted bowl whose edge rested vast smooth table deep violet velvet 
dropped violet became bluer bluer experienced strange optical illusion flopping scene 
bowl seemed turn inside looking inner surface 
shot mountain range vast plain spread 
far distance could see darker spots caused buckled geological strata 
arcot swung ship around saw vast horizon swing sensation changed acceleration turn 
felt nearly weightless lifting high arc 
arcot heading back toward mountains passed 
dropped ship foothills seemed rise meet 
heading lake arcot explained 
seems absolutely deserted things want 
decent exercise past two weeks except straining high gravity

put canary air bird liked imagine quite safe except bacteria perhaps 
naturally altitude air germ free 
good said morey take swim work without worrying spacesuits 
minute fuller objected 
germs wade mentioned think going shorts flock bacteria get tender anatomy got another think coming worry wade said 
chances organisms developing along evolutionary line quite slim 
may find inhabitants shape another world human body fairly well constructed anatomically 
head place able see wide area safe place 
hand useful improved upon little 
true venerians second thumb principle 
chemically bodies probably different 
people venus widely different chemically bacteria make venerian deathly ill killed instant enters body else starves death find kind chemical food needs live 
thing happens venerian attacked earthly microorganism 
even earth evolution produced widely varying types life organism feed one totally incapable feeding another 
instance catch tobacco mosaic virus tobacco plant catch measles virus 
expect microorganism evolve capable feeding earth type tissues would starved death long ago 
bigger animals fuller asked cautiously 
different 
would probably indigestible alien carnivore probably kill first find 
ate might kill end would small consolation 
going go armed 
arcot dropped ship swiftly hovering bare hundred feet waters lake 
little stream winding way mountainside another led clear overflow away 
doubt anything great size lake arcot said slowly thoughtfully 
still even small fish might deadly 
let play safe remove forms life bacterial otherwise 
little touch molecular motion ray greatly diffused trick 
since molecular ray directed motion molecules matter prevented chemical reactions taking place even greatly diffused molecules tend go direction extent delicate balance chemical reactions life upset 
delicate thing stand power upsets reactions violently 
things killed instantly 
light haze ionized air glowed huge cone water lake heaved seemed move depths great movement waters lost fraction weight 
every living thing lake died instantly 
arcot turned ship shining hull glided softly one side lake little sandy beach invited 
seemed indication intelligent life 
took load supplies brought carried shade immense pine like tree gigantic column wood stretched far sky lose green leaves waving sea foliage 
mottled sunlight bright star made feel much home 
color intensity warmth exactly earth 
men wore power suit aid carrying things brought gravity bit higher earth 
difference air pressure little scarcely noticeable even adjusted interior ship 
every intention staying awhile 
pleasant lie warm sun pleasant became difficult remember countless trillions long miles home planet 
hard realize warm blazing star old sol 
arcot carrying load food box 
neutralized weight load weighed hundred pounds 
necessary order permit drag length hose behind toward water could used intake pumps 
morey meanwhile trouble 
carrying load assorted things use pneumatic pillows heavy iron pot boiling water number things 
reached destination floated hundred feet ship using power suit 
forgot momentarily dropped load 
immediately began drop upward buoyancy around three hundred pounds weight two fifty 
dropping load sudden release caused power unit jerk upward somehow controlling knob power pack torn loose 
morey shot air showing fair rate progress toward late abode space way stop 
hand power unit far weak overcome pull power pack rising faster faster realized friends could catch laughingly called arcot help kidnapped power suit rescue arcot looked quickly morey call realized immediately power control come 
knew twenty miles breathable air long morey rose far could catch ancient mariner necessary 
turned power suit using lift hundred pounds gave double morey acceleration 
quickly gathered speed shot toward helpless friend moment later caught passed 
shut power drifted halt began drop 
morey rose toward arcot adjusted power suit match morey velocity 
arcot grabbed morey leg turned power weight fifty pounds 
soon falling rate fall amounted approximately twenty miles per hour arcot cut weight zero continued momentum 
short ground leaped free morey carried momentum touched ground moment later 
wade jumped held 
calm said wade solicitously 
go air like least little thing 
get busy take damned thing fasten lead feet replied morey starting unstrap mechanism 
better hold horses said arcot 
take sure need ancient mariner catch 
produce acceleration man could ever stand something order five thousand gravities tubes could stand 
since one equipped invisibility apparatus one good invisibility suit 
restrain boy go get new knob control 
wade get boy rock hold 
better tie around neck forget fly space 
nuisance locating small object space promised father bring body back anything left 
released morey wade handed large stone 
minutes later returned new adjustment dial repaired morey apparatus 
strain released turned morey parted rock relief 
morey grunted relief looked offending pack 
know stuck sky bound gadget turn nastiest combination feeling stupid helpless comical silly scared hit yet 
somewhat late occurs powered standard power coil straight production line standard overload cut protection associated equipment 
want install emergency cutoff switch case knob something else goes sour 
want emergency overload decide whether emergency overload accepted 
feel sight silly overload relay popped couple thousand feet 
trouble new stuff simply time find never thought things go wrong 
grid resistor oscillator went instance would arcot cocked eye power pack visualizing circuits 
full blast straight control 
modern printed resistors fail 
says books 
wade nodded wisely 
see stock replacement units every electronics shop stocks purposes replacing infallible units 
got point friend 
see four ways change things fail safe operation add morey emergency cut switch 
go full could use intermittent operation get arcot acknowledged 
anybody know silly fail unsafe tricks overlooked ancient mariner fuller asked 
said wade grimace silly question 
think type failure occurs think reason think never occurred 
able think em would 
probably get stuck yet get back 
least clean bugs things 
forget wade get chow suggested fuller 
lying back clad pair short trunks completely relaxed enjoying life 
dark 
fuller right idea said morey looking fuller judicious eye 
think follow example 
makes three favor one way said arcot came ship sank soft sand beach 
lay around lunch decided swim cool waters lake 
one stand guard others went swimming 
standing guard consisted lying back soft sand staring delightful contrast lush green foliage deep blue sky 
several hours gathered things returned ship 
felt rested exercise 
tired merely restless physical exercise made far comfortable 
gathered control room 
apparatus taken tanks filled compressed oxygen replenished 
closed airlock ready start 
lifted air arcot looked lake shrinking 
nice place picnic remember place 
twenty million light years home 
yes agreed morey handy 
suppose find home first let go find local inhabitants 
excellent idea 
way go look wade asked 
lake must outlet sea morey answered 
suggest follow 
rivers size port near mouth port usually means city 
let go said arcot swinging shining ship heading smoothly along line little stream beginning lake 
moved across mountains green foothills came broad rolling plain 
wonder planet inhabited arcot mused 
none land seems cultivated 
morey scanning horizon pair powerful binoculars 
land cultivated take look see range little hills right take look 
handed binoculars arcot 
arcot looked long quietly 
last lowered binoculars handed wade sat next 
looks like ruins city arcot said 
ruins storm would make ruins high explosives would make 
say war people lived driven 
would rejoined morey 
wonder could find conquerors maybe unless mutual annihilation rose bit higher raised speed thousand miles hour 
flew high gently rolling plain mile mile 
little brooklet became great river river kept growing 
ahead range hills wondered river could thread way among 
found went broad pass twisted tortuously high mountains 
miles farther came great natural basin pass wide level bowl 
almost exact center saw looming mass buildings great city look cried morey 
told inhabited arcot winced 
yes shout ear like write things ever 
excited morey nevertheless 
great mass city shaped like titanic cone stood half mile high fully mile half radius 
remarkable thing perfect uniformity buildings every structure seemed conform plan 
seemed though invisible tangible line drawn air 
though sign posted shall buildings 
beyond line structure shall extend vehicle go air directly city practically packed slim long needle like ships every size tiny private ships less fifteen feet long giant freighters six hundred feet longer 
every one conformed rule perfectly around base city seemed slight deviation 
invisible cone touched ground series low buildings made dark metal ground appeared scarred churned 
certainly seem kind ray screen city morey commented 
look perfect cone effect low buildings undoubtedly projectors 
arcot brought ship halt came pass mountain 
shining hull cleft gorge doubt quite hard see city 
suddenly vagrant ray brilliant sun reached break overcast clouds touched shining hull ancient mariner finger gold 
instantly ship shone like polished mirror heliograph 
almost immediately low sound came distant city 
pulsing drone came microphone weird cadence low beating drone like wild music 
louder stronger grew rising pitch slowly suddenly ended burst rising sound terrific whoop alarm 
magic every ship air city shot downward dropping suddenly sight 
seconds air cleared 
seems spotted us said arcot voice tried make nonchalant 
fleet great long ships suddenly rising neighborhood central building tallest group 
went compact wedge formation shot swiftly along wall invisible cone directly low building nearest ancient mariner 
sudden shimmer air 
instant ships heading toward ancient mariner tremendous rate 
shot forward acceleration astonishing men spaceship 
perfect formation darted toward lone shining ship far earth xiv four earthmen watched fleet alien ships roar air toward 
shall signal asked morey also trying nonchalant failing badly arcot 
try light beam method cautioned arcot 
last time tried use light beam signal first contacted nigrans 
nigrans thought kind destruction ray 
started terrible destructive war black star 
let hang peaceably see arcot suggested 
motionless ancient mariner hung advancing attack great battle fleet 
shining hull thing beauty golden sunlight waited advancing ships 
alien ships slowed approached spread great fan shaped crescent 
suddenly ancient mariner gave tremendous leap hurtled toward terrific speed acceleration great arcot nearly hurled unconsciousness 
would except terrific mass ship 
produce acceleration great mass tremendous force needed force even made enemy fleet reel blow sudden arcot managed push power reverse using force molecular drive counteract attraction aliens brought bear 
whole mighty fabric ship creaked titanic load came upon 
using force million tons mighty lux beams withstood stress however ship came halt swiftly backing away alien battle fleet 
give want said arcot grimly 
noticed wade fuller knocked sudden blow morey though slightly groggy still possession senses 
let morey remonstrated 
may able make friends kill 
right replied arcot going give little demonstration power ancient mariner leaped suddenly upward speed defied eyes men rays enemy ships 
turned follow sudden motion ship ancient mariner vanished morey startled instant ship companions disappeared around realized happened 
arcot used invisibility apparatus arcot turned raced swiftly far one side behind strange ships hovered great cliff made edge cleft river bed 
snapped ship full visibility 
wade fuller recovered arcot started barking orders 
wade fuller take molecular ray wade tear cliff throw valley 
fuller turn heat beams power get burn refuse tears heap molten lava going show wade fuller gets melted throw molten lava high air ship long pencil rays faintly violet air ionized reached touched cliff 
instant torn vast mass solid rock came raining valley roaring thunder threw dirt valley air like splashed mud 
violet ray died two rays blinding brilliance reached 
rock suddenly smoking steaming 
became red dull first brighter brighter 
suddenly collapsed great pool white hot lava flowing like water influence beams ship 
pale violet molecular beams touched rock bubbling lava 
instant great mass flaming incandescent rock flying like glowing meteor air 
shot terrific speed broke mid air fell back rain red hot stone 
bright rays died pale fingers molecular beams traced across level ground 
touched solid soil spouted air like vast fountain fall back frost covered powder 
rays swung sun destruction work chance man works man mattered tiny planet rays could hurl one mighty sun another blaze awful conflagration would light space million light years around mighty glare light giant plow valley torn rent great streaks pale violet rays molecular force 
wade tore loose giant boulder sent rocketing heavens 
came terrific crash minutes later bury deep soil splintered fragments 
suddenly ancient mariner jerked violently 
evidently undaunted display power aliens rays gripped earthmen ship drawing terrific acceleration 
time ship racing toward city caught beam one low built sturdy buildings housed protective ray projectors 
arcot threw mighty power units drove ship bracing pull beam 
wade use molecular ray stop beam arcot ordered 
ship stationary quivering titanic forces struggled 
enemy fleet raced toward trying come aid men tower 
pale glow molecular beam reached ghostly finger touched heavy walled ray projector building 
sudden flash discharging energy tower hurled high air leaving gaping hole ground 
instantly collapse beam held ancient mariner shot backward away scene battle 
arcot snapped drive turned invisibility apparatus 
hung motionless silent invisible air awaiting developments 
close formation one group ships blocked opening wall rays removal one projector building caused 
three ships went investigate wreck building fallen mile away 
rest fleet circled city darting around searching frantically invisible enemy fully aware danger collision 
unnerving tension expecting every second made erratic nervous n th degree 
sticking pretty close home said arcot 
seem anxious play us 
morey said looking angry 
might least willing see wanted 
want investigate cities 
come thoroughly enjoyed rest little mountain lake disappointed driven away 
wanted knew could easily torn entire city roots think ought smash thoroughly said wade 
certainly inhospitable people one would like know attraction ray said fuller curiously 
ray easily understood take look wreck made instruments arcot told 
projected magnetism 
see might done worked 
ray simply attracted everything path magnetic included lux metal hull 
luckily apparatus shielded magnetism 
things repaired easily 
bet wade finds gear galley thrown around quite bit 
go wade asked 
well world bigger earth said morey 
even afraid go cities run farms must cities 
thing puzzles though see possibly raise enough food city area available people possibly live hydrogen instead oxygen arcot quoted grinning 
told made little announcement meeting black star situation 
trouble 
suggestion meets fate morey right win agreed morey 
let see find nations world friendly 
arcot looked sun 
well north equator 
go air thin put speed go south temperate zone 
see find people peaceably inclined 
arcot cut invisibility tubes 
instantly enemy ships neighborhood turned darted toward top speed 
shining ancient mariner darted deep blue vault sky moment later lost view 
lot courage said arcot looking city sank sight 
take one quarter much courage fight known enemy matter deadly fight unknown enemy force something tear mountains throw forts air like toys 
oh courage right morey conceded wish quite anxious display high ground accelerating force one gravity 
arcot cut acceleration enough overcome air resistance height flying low 
sky black stars showing around blazing sun 
unfamiliar stars unfamiliar constellations stars another universe 
short time ship dropping rapidly downward horizontal power 
air resistance slowed rapidly 
drifted high south temperate zone 
stretched seemingly endless expanse great blue green ocean 
lack water wade commented 
could pretty well figure large oceans arcot said 
land green plenty clouds 
far ahead low mass solid land appeared blue horizon 
soon became obvious continent approaching large island stretching hundreds miles north south 
arcot dropped ship lower mountainous terrain become broken would impossible detect city thirty miles 
green defiles great mountains provided good camouflage kept great number ships attacking sides ray stations 
cities certainly located eye war arcot wondered sort conflict lasted long cities designed perpetual war 
never peace look fuller called 
another city situated little natural bowl mountains another cone cities 
wade fuller manned ray projectors arcot dropped ship toward city one hand reverse switch case inhabitants tried use magnetic beam 
last come quite low 
ships air people sight 
suddenly outside microphone picked low humming sound 
long cigar shaped object heading toward ship high speed 
painted dark mottled green nearly invisible background foliage beneath ship 
wade catch ray arcot commanded sharply moving ship one side time 
instantly guided missile turned kept coming toward 
wade triggered molecular beam missile suddenly dashing toward ground terrific speed 
terrific flash flame shock wave concussion 
great hole gaped ground 
sure know chemistry remarked wade looking great hole explosion torn ground 
atomic hand dynamite tnt either like know use personally said arcot angrily think less gentle hint move like way received wanted meet people 
course planet might inhabited wonder said morey thoughtfully 
arcot people obviously warned attack probably city 
come nearly halfway around world certainly gone much farther away still planet 
find city league since league goes halfway around world expected us fair assume basis geographical location world one league hmmm interplanetary war mused arcot 
would certainly prove one planets inhabited 
question one probable one next inner planet aphrodite replied morey 
arcot fired ship sky 
conclusions correct think see reason stay planet 
let go see neighbors less aggressive shot ship straight rotating axis pointing straight away planet 
increased acceleration left outer fringes atmosphere ship hitting full four gravities 
going shorten things use space control arcot said 
gravitational field sun drain lot energy lead cheap plenty know reason dr richard arcot angry boiling way xv familiar tension air space field built hurled suddenly forward star like dot planet suddenly expanded rushed forward speed far greater light 
moment grown disc arcot stopped space control 
moving forward molecular drive 
shortly arcot began decelerate 
within ten minutes beginning feel outermost wisps cloud laden atmosphere 
heat blazing sun intense surface planet doubt far warmer place earthmen would find comfortable 
would far better suited remain planet evidently wanted dropped atmosphere sinking miles ship slowed retarding influence air molecular power 
went mile mile heavy cloud layer unable see ground beneath 
suddenly thick enveloping mists held gone 
flying smoothly along leaden skies perpetual dim dark clouds 
despite brightness sun clouds made light dim gray 
reflected enormous percentage light struck climate hot feared 
ground dark somber mantle clouds hills rivers crawled across wide plains oddly stunted forests looked though modeled great mass greenish gray putty 
discouraging world 
glad wait swim remarked wade 
sure looks like rain 
arcot stopped ship held motionless ten miles wade made chemical analysis air 
report looked favorable plenty oxygen trace carbon dioxide mixed nitrogen 
water vapor wade said 
air saturated heat humidity bother us coin phrase 
arcot dropped ship still farther time moving forward toward sea seen distance 
swiftly ground sped beneath 
low plain sloped toward sea vast level surface gray leaden water 
oh brother pleasant world said fuller sarcastically 
certainly inspiring scene 
leaden skies heavy clouds dark land gray green sea always shaded perpetual half light lest burning sun heat beyond endurance 
gloomy world 
turned followed coast 
still sign inhabitants visible 
mile mile passed beneath shining ship followed ragged shore 
small indentations baylets ran shallow level sea 
world moon tideless except slight solar tides 
finally far ahead well back coast arcot spotted great mountain range 
going head told others 
people war inimical friends planet chances put cities mountains 
cities 
ancient mariner penetrated less hundred miles along twisted ranges mountains saw far ahead great cone shaped city 
city taller larger planet cone ran farther actual city buildings leaving aircraft room 
arcot stopped watched city long time telescope 
seemed similar others respects 
type needle like ships floated air type cone ray projectors nestled base city invisible protection 
may well take chance said arcot 
shot ship forward within mile city plain sight inhabitants 
suddenly without warning signal apparently air traffic went wild gone 
every ship seemed ducked unseen place refuge 
within minutes fleet battleships winging way toward invisible barrier 
great semi cylinder quarter mile high quarter mile radius advanced toward ancient mariner 
arcot kept ship motionless 
knew weapon magnetic ray otherwise would war long ago 
knew could cope magnetism 
slowly ships advanced 
last halted quarter mile earth ship 
single ship detached mass advanced within hundred feet ancient mariner 
quickly arcot jumped feet 
morey take controls 
evidently want parley fight 
going 
ran length corridor room put power suit 
moment later left airlock launched space flying swiftly toward ship 
come alone armed probably match anything could bring bear 
went directly toward broad expanse glass marked control room alien ship looked curiously 
pilot man much like arcot quite tall tremendous girth huge chest great powerful arms 
hands like venerians two thumbs 
equal curiosity man stared arcot floating air without apparent means support 
arcot hung moment motioned wished enter 
giant alien motioned around side ship 
halfway length ship arcot saw port suddenly open 
flew swiftly forward entered 
man stood giant tall wade even magnificently muscled tremendous shoulders giant chest 
thighs rounded close fitting gray uniform bulging smooth muscle 
considerably larger man pilot room whereas pale yellow color man burned healthy shade tan 
features regular pleasing hair black straight high forehead denoted high degree intelligence clear black eyes heavy black eyebrows seemed curious friendly 
nose rather thin sharp mouth curved smile welcome 
chin firm sharp distinct face neck 
looked arcot smiled eyes met 
torlos said alien pointing great chest 
arcot replied earthman pointing 
pointed stranger 
torlos 
knew pronounced exactly alien would suffice 
stranger smiled approval 
ahcut said pointing earthman 
pointed comparatively thin arms earthman 
pointed arcot head mechanism wore back head went motions walking great effort 
pointed arcot head nodding approval 
arcot understood immediately meant 
alien indicated earthman comparatively weak need muscle made head machines work 
decided head better arcot looked man eyes concentrated idea friendship projecting mental power 
black eyes suddenly widened surprise quickly turned pleasure tried concentrate one thought 
difficult arcot interpret thoughts alien concepts different form 
last caught idea location location interrogative interpret hit 
torlos asking arcot pulled pad paper pencil pocket began sketch rapidly 
first drew local galaxy dots stars swept hand around 
made one dots little heavier pointed bright blur cloudy sky 
drew circle around dot put another dot time indicating planet beneath 
torlos showed understood 
arcot continued 
end paper drew another galaxy indicated earth 
drew dotted line earth planet 
torlos looked incredulous wonder 
indicated respect arcot brain 
arcot smiled indicated city 
go projected mind 
torlos turned glanced toward end corridor 
one sight shouted order deep pleasant voice 
instantly another giant man came striding corridor lithe softness indicated tremendous muscular power excellently controlled 
saluted placing left hand right side chest 
arcot noted future reference 
torlos spoke alien moment 
left returned minute later said something torlos 
torlos turned arcot indicating return ship follow 
arcot suddenly turned eyes looked directly black eyes alien 
torlos projected come us ship commander ship 
go without permission chief 
ask chief 
turned left arcot 
back minutes carrying small handbag 
go 
keeps communication ship 
arcot adjusted weight zero floated lightly doorway 
rose six feet landing indicated torlos grasp arcot feet one hand 
torlos closed grip steel ankle stepped platform 
dropped power suit adjusted load 
arcot yelped pain torlos surprise floating involuntarily gripped tighter 
quickly arcot turned power gasped felt weight mount swiftly 
estimated torlos weight two hundred seventy like three hundred fifty soon however weight adjusted floated easily toward ancient mariner 
floated door ship inside torlos released hold 
arcot immediately slammed roof weight three hundred fifty pounds moment later back floor rubbing back 
shook head frowned smiled pretended limp 
let go suddenly admonished telepathically 
know 
sorry torlos thought contritely 
friend asked wade entered corridor 
certainly looks husky 
arcot affirmed 
must weighted lead thought pull legs 
look arms want get mad wade grinned 
looks like make mean opponent 
name torlos replied arcot fuller stepped 
torlos looking curiously crowbar lying rack wall 
picked flexed bit man might flex rapier test material 
held far front proceeded tie knot inch thick metal bar still frowning puzzlement untied straightened best could put back rack 
earthmen staring utter astonishment see terrific strength man displayed 
smiled turned 
could arm length wade said thoughtfully could really tried try see fuller asked sweetly 
think easier probably quicker ways committing suicide wade replied 
arcot laughed looking torlos projected general meaning last remarks 
torlos joined laugh 
people strong thought 
understand 
tool could use weak 
wade others picked thought wade laughed 
suppose use old beams tie christmas presents 
arcot held moment silent consultation torlos turned others 
supposed follow men city kind audience ruler according torlos 
let get started rest fleet waiting 
arcot led torlos main engine room going main coil room torlos stopped 
drive apparatus thought 
yes arcot projected 
smaller power equipment small private machine thoughts radiated surprise 
could make great distance power said arcot 
look drew molecular ray pistol 
alone powerful enough destroy battle fleet without danger part 
despite strength helpless arcot touched switch belt vanished 
amazement torlos reached hand spot arcot stood 
nothing 
suddenly turned touching back head 
something tugged hair looked around moved arms around avail 
nothing 
blink eye arcot floating air 
avails strength air torlos asked smiling 
safety sake torlos thought want friend grinned widely 
arcot led way control room morey already started follow great fleet toward city 
going city arcot asked torlos telepathically 
capital world sator commander military civil forces 
see 
summoned torlos replied carefully 
visited third world system first arcot told alien repulsed us 
tried friendly attacked us 
order keep damaged destroy one city protecting ray buildings 
last thought hard transmit arcot pictured mentally scene ray building ripped ground hurled air 
sudden anxiety concern torlos stared arcot eyes 
look arcot read even telepathy hidden heretofore 
destroy city asked torlos anxiously 
question man hoping destruction enemies cities arcot got mental picture city picked idea home course ideas city home might synonymous people never seemed leave cities 
feeling worry want hurt arcot thought 
destroyed ray building self defense 
understand 
despite obvious mental efforts torlos positively radiated feeling relief war world arcot asked coolly 
two worlds war many generations torlos said quickly changed subject 
soon meet leader forces sator 
powerful 
word must absolutely obeyed 
would wise unnecessarily offend 
see mind tells great power many ships sator nansal boast 
commander horlan military commander since every man necessarily soldier true ruler 
understand arcot thought 
turned morey spoke english torlos could understand 
morey going see top man 
rules army runs everything 
go leave wade fuller behind rear guard 
may dangerous chased one world ought careful possible 
go fully armed stay radio contact times 
watch want even touch ship know kind people 
followed satorian ships toward city 
giant magnetic ray barrier opened ancient mariner followed 
inside alien city 
xvi ancient mariner great buildings alien city jutted gray light gray world massiveness seemed accentuate depressing light 
broad roofs saw hundreds people coming watch moved across city 
according torlos first friendly strangers ever seen 
explored planets system without finding friendly life 
buildings sloped toward center city mass great central building loomed 
fleet leading earth ship settled wide courtyard surrounded building 
arcot dropped ancient mariner beside 
men torlos ship formed two squads came airlocks marched great shining ship earth 
formed two neat rows one side airlock 
come morey said arcot 
wanted 
wade keep radio going full amplification building may cut power 
try keep posted going probably busy answering questions telepathically 
arcot morey followed torlos dim light gray sky walking across courtyard ranks soldiers torlos ship 
heavy gate solid bronze swung massive bronze hinges 
building seemed made dense gray stone much like granite depressing perfectly unrelieved front 
bright spots color earthly venerian structures 
even lines grimly utilitarian seemed decoration 
great bronze door walked across small vestibule 
mighty concourse giant hallway went completely structure 
around great granite pillars rose support mighty building 
square cut lent little grace huge room floor walls made hard light green stone almost color foliage 
one wall giant tablet great plaque fifteen feet high made deep violet stone inlaid series characters language world 
like english letters seemed read horizontally whether read left right right left way knowing 
letters made red metal arcot morey recognize 
arcot turned torlos projected thought tablet ever since beginning war planet nansal names mighty leaders inscribed plaque rarest metal 
term rarest metal definite torlos arcot decided question meaning time permitted 
crossed great hall came evidently elevator 
door slid open two earthmen followed torlos lieutenant cubicle 
torlos pushed small button 
door slid shut moment later arcot morey staggered sudden terrific load car shot upward acceleration least three gravities continued long enough earthmen get used snapped went flying toward ceiling continued upward momentum 
slowed influence planet gravitation came stop exactly opposite doorway higher floor 
wow elevator exclaimed morey stepped flexing knees tried readjust 
call violent way getting upstairs designed lazy man cripple prefer walk thanks want know old people get upstairs 
die young using elevators mused arcot 
funny thing 
seem bothered acceleration 
actually jumped little floor started seem experience much difficulty stopped 
looked thoughtful moment 
know torlos bending crowbar back ship picked curious thought wonder turned giant alien 
torlos gave thought idea bone metal torlos looked surprise pointed mutely heavy belt wore made closely woven links iron wire right morey arcot exclaimed 
men iron bones wonder could bend crowbar would easy would snap human arm bone wait minute morey objected 
could iron grow stone grow countered arcot 
bones essentially calcium phosphate rock matter different body chemistry 
body fluids probably alkaline iron rust alkaline solution 
arcot talking rapidly followed aliens long corridor 
thing confirms theory elevator 
merely iron cage magnetic beam pulled terrific acceleration 
iron bones men would similarly influenced notice acceleration much 
morey grinned 
willing bet use cells prisons magnetize floor poor guy could never get away arcot nodded 
course bones must pure iron bones evidently retain magnetism leave field 
seem morey interrupted 
let continue discussion later 
party stopped outside large elaborately carved door first sign ornamentation earthmen seen 
four guards armed pistols discovered later powered compressed air terrific pressure 
hurled small metal slug rifled barrel effective distance mile although could fire four times without reloading 
torlos spoke briefly guard saluted opened door 
two earthmen followed torlos large room 
large crescent shaped table around seated several men 
center crescent curve sat man gray uniform bedecked insignia medals ribbons decorations uniform scarcely visible 
entire assemblage including leader rose earthmen entered 
arcot morey taking hint snapped attention delivered precise military salute 
greet name planet said arcot aloud 
know understand word saying hope sounds impressive enough 
salute high muckymuck morey successfully keeping straight face raised hand said sonorously goes double bub 
language leader replied putting hands hips definite motion shaking head side side time 
arcot watched man closely spoke 
taller torlos less heavily built others 
seemed torlos unusually powerful even world 
leader finished arcot smiled turned project thoughts torlos 
tell leader come planet far away across vast depths space 
come peace leave peace would like ask favors repay giving secret weapons 
easily conquer nansal 
want wire made element lead information astronomers 
torlos turned spoke leader deep powerful voice 
meanwhile morey trying get communication ship 
walls however seemed made metal get wade 
cut ship said quietly arcot 
afraid think right 
proposition good turn 
torlos turned back arcot leader finished speaking 
commanding one asks prove possibilities weapons 
scientists tell impossible make trip claim made 
scientists say true extent arcot thought 
learned body go faster speed light yes 
say fact 
made trip must necessity less twenty million years old tell things yet know space 
velocity light thing fixed nature space right torlos consulted scientists turned back arcot 
agree know secrets universe agree speed light fixed nature space 
fast sound travel arcot asked 
ask medium mean fast light travel air glass speed light variable sound 
alter nature space make velocity light greater go faster normal space say true torlos said conversation men table say space unalterable since emptiness 
ask know curvature space 
arcot becoming worried fear explanation would unintelligible unless knew terms could explain would take long time teach 
say torlos thought misunderstood 
say space could possibly curved space emptiness could empty nothingness curved 
arcot turned morey shrugged shoulders 
give morey bad case 
insist space nothing curved go 
know curvature space said morey ask learned velocity light limiting velocity moving body 
torlos translated scientists gave reply 
say know space know speed light ultimate 
tested spaceships high speeds experiments smallest particles electricity 
scientists looking arcot protest felt trying foist something 
arcot becoming exasperated 
well insist come another star think come explored system found people must come another star 
accept explanations let think theory explain facts paused torlos translate went 
say know 
tell watch 
drew molecular ray pistol lifted heavy metal chair air 
morey drew heat beam turned chair 
seconds glowing white hot collapsed fiery ball liquid metal 
morey shut heat beam arcot held ball air cooled rapidly influence molecular ray 
lowered floor 
obvious scientists impressed emperor talking eagerly men around 
talked several minutes saying nothing earthmen 
torlos stood quietly waiting message relay 
emperor called guards moved inside door 
torlos turned arcot 
show emotion came telepathic warning 
listening spoke 
commanding one wants weapons 
regardless scientists tell possibility trip knows weapons work wants 
see satorian 
nansal sent many years ago spy 
served fleets many years gained trust 
telling truth soon see 
people going follow usual line action take direct way toward end 
going attack believing despite weapons go superior numbers 
better move fast calling guards already arcot turned morey face calm heart beating like vibrohammer 
keep face straight morey 
look surprised 
planning jump us 
rip right wall stopped 
late order given guards leaping toward 
arcot grabbed ray pistol one guards jumped chance draw 
torlos seized man one leg arm tensing huge muscles hurled thirty feet commanding one force killed instantly turned grabbed another first victim landed hurled toward advancing guards 
arcot thought fleetingly proof torlos story nansal greater gravity third planet made great deal stronger satorians one guards trying reach arcot 
acting instinctively earthman lashed hard jab point satorian jaw 
iron bones transmitted shock beautifully delicate brain man head jerked back collapsed floor 
arcot hand felt though hit hammer far busy pay attention pain 
morey realized futility trying overcome guards wrestling 
thing dodge punch 
guards trying take earthmen alive greater weight move quite fast arcot morey 
torlos still action 
seen success earthmen weak able knock man blow jaw 
driving fists like pistons imitated blows deadly results every man struck went forever 
dead piling around open door could see reinforcements arriving 
somehow save earthmen sator got secrets nansal would lost reached grabbed one fallen men hurled across room smashing back men struggled attack 
picked another followed second projectile 
third 
speed tirelessness giant engine war slammed macabre ammunition oncoming reinforcements telling results 
last arcot free moment needed 
jerked molecular ray pistol holster beamed mercilessly toward door hurling attackers violently backwards 
died instantly chilled corpses driving back comrades killing force 
moment every man room dead except two earthmen giant torlos 
outside room could hear shouted orders satorian guards rallied 
try kill us arcot said 
come got get sure said morey way xvii morey pull wall door block passage arcot ordered 
get wall 
arcot pointed pistol triggered 
outer wall flew outward explosion flying masonry 
switched radio called ancient mariner 
wade cut metal walls doublecrossed tried jump us 
torlos warned us time 
torn wall hang outside airlock open wait us 
use rays invisible might hit us 
suddenly room rocked explosion debris morey ray torn door blasted away 
score men leaped gap dust settled 
morey beamed mercilessly could fire weapons 
air quick arcot yelled 
turned power suit rose air signalling torlos grab ankles done 
morey slammed another parting shot toward doorway lifted toward ceiling 
earthmen snapped invisibility units 
torlos direct contact arcot also vanished sight 
courageous foolhardy satorians leaped opening stared bewilderment saw one moving 
arcot morey torlos hanging invisible air 
shining bulk ancient mariner drifted view 
drew back behind wall sought shelter 
one began fire compressed air gun absolutely effect heavy lux walls might well hit mosquito 
airlock swung open arcot morey headed breach wall 
moment later inside ship 
heavy door hissed closed behind settled floor 
take controls arcot said 
morey head rear take moleculars take torlos handle heat beam 
turned ran toward control room wade fuller waiting 
wade take forward molecular beams fuller handle heat projector 
arcot strapped control chair 
suddenly terrific explosion titanic mass ship rocked detonation bomb one men building fired ship 
torlos evidently understood operation heat beam projector quickly stabbing beam reached great tower floor roof suddenly leaned slumped entire side building converted mass glowing stone molten steel 
crashed heavily ground half mile 
already forty great battleships rising meet 
think better get moving arcot said 
let magnetic ray touch us would kill torlos 
going cut invisibility units use heat beams whatever arcot snapped ship invisibility darted one side 
enemy ships suddenly halted wild rush looked around amazement opponent 
arcot heading magnetic force field surrounded city torlos made mistake 
turned powerful heat beam downwards picked enemy battleship 
fell blazing wreck ray touched building behind ionized air established conducting path ship planet 
apparatus designed make planet invisible made noble effort 
result one tubes blew ancient mariner visible 
arcot time replace tube satorian fleet kept busy 
arcot drove ship shooting twisting upward wade morey kept firing molecular beams precision 
pale rays reached touch battleship wherever touched ships went wreckage falling city 
spite odds ancient mariner giving good account 
always arcot working ship toward magnetic wall base city 
suddenly giant pneumatic guns joined battle hurling huge explosive shells toward earth ship 
managed hit ancient mariner twice time ship staggered force blast foot thick armor lux metal ignored explosions 
magnetic rays touched times time torlos thrown violently floor ship path beams short time badly injured 
made injuries ray used morey mean gunner either judging work 
three ships attempted commit suicide efforts destroy earthmen 
semi successful managed commit suicide 
trying crash ship simply caught morey wade molecular beam thrown away 
morey actually developed use 
caught beam used bullets smash ships throwing molecular ray cold move 
arcot finally managed reach magnetic wall 
wade called 
get projector building molecular beam reached black metal dome sailed high sky breaking solidity magnetic wall 
instant later ancient mariner shot gap 
moments would far away city 
torlos seemed realize 
moving quickly pushed morey away molecular beam projector taking controls away 
realize power ray know projectors could move whole suns orbits 
knew destructive 
several miles city turned projector twisting power control 
amazement saw entire city suddenly leap air flash space howling meteor vanished cloudbank overhead 
behind deep hole planet surface mighty chasm lined dark granite 
torlos stared amazement horror 
arcot turned back slowly sailed spot city 
saw dozen battleships racing away spread news disaster fortunate enough outside city beam struck 
arcot maneuvered ship directly mighty pit sank slowly using great searchlights illuminate dark chasm 
far far could see solid rock bottom 
thing miles deep 
arcot lifted ship headed cloud layer bright light great yellow sun sea gray misty clouds 
arcot signalled morey come control room take controls ship 
head space morey 
want find torlos pulled last stunt 
wade put new tube invisibility unit sure wade replied 
way happened back surprised devil hear yelling help everything seemed peaceful 
arcot flexed bruised hands grinned ruefully 
plenty happened 
went explain wade fuller happened meeting satorian commander 
nice bunch people deal wade said caustically 
tried get everything lost 
would given plenty decent 
sort war people two planets carrying anyway question intend settle replied arcot 
opportunity talk torlos yet 
admitted spy nansal fun began busy ask questions ever since 
come let go library 
arcot indicated torlos go 
wade fuller followed 
seated arcot began telepathic questioning 
torlos force morey leave ray destroy city certainly reason kill non combatant women children city told absolutely use heat beam invisible use rays battleship made invisibility break destroyed tube 
sorry man earth replied torlos 
say fully understand effect rays would 
know long would remain invisible thing accomplished laboratories fractions second feared might become visible soon 
one latest battleships equipped new secret deadly weapon 
know exactly weapon knew ship could deadly us wanted make sure attacked 
used beam ship invisible 
intend destroy city 
trying tear factory builds battleships wanted destroy machines 
conception power ray 
horrified see city disappear wanted protect people 
torlos smiled bitterly 
lived among treacherous people many years say provocation destroy city everyone 
intention earthman 
arcot knew sincere 
could deception communicating telepathically 
wished used communicating commanding one sator trouble would stopped quickly still conception magnitude power beam torlos arcot told 
rays ship tore sun orbit threw another 
city could whole planet 
tamper forces understand torlos 
forces ship would make energies greatest battleship seem weak futile 
race space billion times faster speed light tear apart destroy atoms matter rip apart greatest planets turn hurtling stars send want curve space please put fires sun wish 
torlos respect powers ship release energies unknowingly great 
torlos looked around awe 
seen engines small apparently futile things compared solid might giant engines ship seen explosive charges knew would split ship open end end bounce harmlessly smooth walls ship 
seen destroy fleet magnetic ships formed supposedly impregnable guard around mightiest city sator 
touched button giant city shot space leaving behind screaming tornado vast chasm crust blasted planet 
could appreciate full significance velocities arcot told knew made bad mistake underrating powers ship touch things without permission earthman torlos promised earnestly 
ancient mariner drove space rapidly eating millions miles separated nansal sator 
arcot sat control room morey discussing passenger 
know arcot mused thinking man strength iron skeleton explain 
muscles move skeleton around 
got muscles right morey grinned 
see mean muscles big tire easily seem 
seems tireless watched throw men one another like bullets machine gun 
threw last one violently first men weighed three hundred pounds apparently muscles felt fatigue another thing pointed arcot 
way breathing way seemed keep cool 
got dripping sweat hot moist air almost much 
friend cool ever 
fight even breathing heavily agreed morey 
notice fight breathing heavily deeply swiftly shallow panting breath runner deep full yet faster breathe 
could hear breathing spite noise battle 
noticed arcot said 
started breathing fight started 
human fight swiftly tremendous vigor ten seconds putting forth best effort breathe twice 
another two minutes breathes heavily usual 
slow back normal 
used surplus oxygen system replaced run oxygen debt 
keep breathing hard get back oxygen surplus body requires 
torlos fatigue use oxygen air work therefore body chemical engine morey nodded slowly 
see driving 
body uses heat energy air muscles turn heat energy motion way molecular beams exactly lives heat arcot said 
noticed seems almost cold blooded body temperature room times 
sense reptilian vastly efficient greatly different reptile earth ever knew 
eats food right needs replace body cells fuel brain 
oh brother said morey softly 
wonder things could kept fight hours without getting tired fatigue unknown cold weather 
need sleep replace worn parts 
world warm upright axis seasons 
survive arctic obviously ideal form life tropics 
two men found later morey wrong last point 
men torlos race small organ mass cells lower abdomen could absorb food bloodstream oxidize yielding heat whenever temperature blood dropped certain point 
could live comfortably arctic zones carried heaters 
vast strength limited however forced eat subject fatigue 
wade fuller trying speak torlos telepathically evidently run difficulty fuller called control room hey arcot come minute thought telepathy universal language guy get ideas make 
seemed thinking nourishment food found thinking heat right arcot told heading library 
entered torlos smiled arcot picked thought easily friends seem understand thoughts 
made arcot explained thought forms different 
heat food practically thing think 
continued explaining carefully torlos differences bodies methods using energy 
stone bones torlos thought amazement 
chemical engines muscles wonder seem weak 
yet brains would hate fight war people brings another point arcot continued 
would like know war people sator people nansal began 
going long torlos nodded 
tell story 
history began many centuries ago history persecution rebellion 
yet think interesting history 
hundreds years ago nansal xviii hundreds years ago nansal lived wise brilliant teacher named norus 
developed ideal philosophy life code ethics 
taught principles nobility without arrogance pride without stubbornness humility without servility 
gathered group men began develop spread ideals 
new philosophy spread across planet nansalians adopted began raise children according tenets 
philosophy however workable however noble hope convert everyone 
always remains hard core men feel old way best way 
case men whose lives based cunning deceit treachery 
one men brilliant warped genius named sator built first spaceship men fled nansal set government free persecution believed suffered hands believers norus 
fled second planet ship crashed builder sator killed 
hundreds years nothing heard emigrants people nansal believed dead 
nansal peace 
satorians managed live alien world built civilization civilization based entirely different system 
system cunning 
cunning right 
man could plot cunningly gain ends deceiving friends best man deserved live 
restrictions loyalty one thing loyalty country world 
time satorians rediscovered space drive time living new planet changed physically 
somewhat smaller nansalians lighter color world always sunless 
warm rays sun tanned skins nansalians darker color 
satorians first came nansal presumably peace 
many hundreds years without war nansalians accepted trade treaties signed 
years satorians traded peacefully 
meantime satorian spies working find strengths weaknesses nansal searching discover secret weapons processes 
rigorously guarded secrets 
refused disclose secrets magnetic beam magnetic space drive 
finally suspicious nansalians realized danger situation 
three men students one great scientific schools nansal realized situation studied 
law prohibiting men nansal going sator seemed nature raised impenetrable barrier 
nansalians went sator died mysterious disease 
method found whereby man body could sterilized bacteriologically speaking could spread disease used satorians entering nansal 
sterilize whole planet 
nansalians could go sator 
three men different idea 
carefully studied speech mannerisms customs satorians 
learned imitate slang idioms 
went even picked three satorian spaceship navigators studied minutely every time got chance order learn habits speech patterns 
three satorians exceptionally large men almost perfect doubles three nansalians one one nansalians replaced 
bleached faces surgeons working photographs changed features three nansalians exact doubles three astrogators 
acted 
three trips one men went back navigator nansalian 
six years returned nansal finally learned two things 
first place disease killed nansalians come contact satorians nansal nothing poison acted contact skin 
nansalians gone sator simply murdered 
disease simply satorian plot keep nansalians going sator 
second thing learned secret satorian magnetic space drive 
common knowledge sator commander would soon lead across space conquer nansal settle world clear air cloudless skies could see stars space night 
waiting could build larger fleet learned could nansalians 
attacked three years three nansalian spies returned information 
three years nansal secretly succeeded building fleet magnetic ships went quickly vastly greater fleet satorians 
magnetic rays deadly killing everyone struck 
could lift iron boned nansalians high air drop hundreds feet death 
buildings steel iron frames went crushing hundreds others 
practically depopulated whole planet 
warnings three spies time 
enlarged great natural caverns dug others solid rock 
built laboratories factories dwelling places far underground satorians could never find 
enough men reached caverns disaster struck carry 
chosen strongest healthiest intelligent nansal 
lived century planet overrun conquerors cities rebuilt satorians 
century magnetic ray shield developed hidden nansalians 
daring last face conquerors built city surface protected magnetic force screen 
time satorians found city late 
battle fleet mobilized rushed spot city impregnable 
great domed power stations already operation made nonmagnetic materials could pulled ground 
magnetic beams neutralized shield ship could pass without killing every man aboard 
first city giant munitions plant 
nansalians built factories laughed armies sator raged impotently magnetic barrier 
tried sending missiles induction heating every metal part bombs either caused explode instantly drop harmlessly burn 
meantime men nansal building fleet 
satorians stepped production nansalians developed method projecting magnetic screen 
approaching satorian ship magnetic support cut crashed ground 
took nearly thirty years hard work harder fighting nansalians convince people sator nansal philosophy norus wiped capable wiping satorians 
screened protected fleet followers norus smashed satorian cities drove enemy back sator 
three enemy cities left nansal somehow managed learn secret magnetic screen 
time forces nansal increased tremendously developed next surprise satorians 
one another three remaining cities destroyed barrage poison gas 
fleet sator tried retaliate nansalians prepared 
every building sealed filters built air conditioning systems 
shortly men nansal control planet fleet stood guard planet 
satorians beaten technologically still ready give 
falling back peculiar philosophy life pulled trick nansalians would never thought 
sued peace 
government nansal willing enough bloodshed 
permitted delegation arrive 
ship escorted city parleying began 
satorian delegation asked absolutely unreasonable terms 
demanded fleet bases nansal demanded unreasonable rate exchange two powers one would highly favorable sator wanted impose fantastic restrictions nansalian travel none whatsoever 
month followed month months became years diplomats nansal tried patiently logically show satorians unreasonable demands 
suspect satorians intention trying get conditions asked 
sole purpose drag parleying bickering quarreling demanding conceding enough give nansalians hope treaty might eventually consummated 
time factories sator working furiously build greatest fleet ever crossed space two planets ready attack satorian delegation told nansal frankly would treaty 
day delegation left satorian fleet swept upon nansal nansalians beaten back cities safe behind magnetic screens unable attack 
forces sator easily fact 
supply line long fleet suffered greatly hands defenders nansal 
long balance power nearly equal neither side dared attack 
balance swung toward nansal 
nansalian scientist discovered compact method storing power 
oddly enough similar method dr richard arcot discovered hundred thousand light centuries away store nearly power inefficient great improvement older method generating energy ship 
nansalian ships could made smaller lighter maneuverable time could equipped heavier powerful magnetic beam generators 
shortly satorians mercy nansal 
could fight faster powerful ships nansalians went defeat 
sued peace 
time nansal knew better went right developing fleet diplomats sator argued 
satorians fools expect nansal swallow bait second time 
sator another ace sleeve 
ten days arrived every diplomat courier satorian delegation committed suicide puzzled government nansal reported deaths sator expecting immediate renewal hostilities quite sure sator assumed murdered 
nansal totally unprepared happened sator acknowledged message respects said would send new commission 
two days later nansal realized tricked 
horrible disease broke spread like wildfire 
incubation period twelve days time gave sign 
flesh began rot away victim died within hours 
wonder ambassadors committed suicide millions died including torlos father raging epidemic followed 
purely lucky accident nansalian medical research teams came cure preventive inoculation disease spread whole planet 
sator delegation inoculated disease sacrifice lives spread nansal 
although satorians developed horribly virulent strain virus found cure diplomats knew going die 
managed stop disease swept planet nansalians decided pull trick 
radio communication sator cut way lead satorian government believe nansal dying disease 
scientists sator knew virus virulent fact virulent good 
killed host every time virus could live outside living cell 
knew shortly every nansalian died virus would dead 
fleet started nansal six months radio contact broken 
expecting find nansal dead planet totally unprepared find alive ready attack 
satorian fleet vastly surprised find living vigorous enemy totally wiped 
since time planets remained state armed truce 
neither developed weapon would enable gain advantage enemy 
spy infested move could pass undiscovered 
stalemate 
xix torlos spread hands eloquently 
history war 
wonder people suspicious ship appeared wonder drove away afraid men sator saw weapons afraid civilization 
hand men sator fear knew code honor would permit us make treacherous attack 
regret people drove away blame arcot admit could 
turned morey 
certainly reasonable driving us cities experience taught safest way 
good offense always best defense 
experience taught unlike torlos eat 
wonder might good idea get little rest bushed 
good idea agreed morey 
ask wade stand guard sleep 
torlos wants company talk wade well anyone 
due sleep 
arcot morey fuller went rooms rest 
arcot morey tired hour fuller rose went control room wade communicating telepathically torlos 
hello wade greeted 
thought going join snoring chorus 
tried get tune 
talking torlos fair success 
getting trick thought communication wade said enthusiastically 
asked torlos wanted sleep seems regularly one day ten 
sleep sleep soundly 
coma something like hibernation bear possum 
want business mr john doe happens asleep business wait 
takes something really drastic wake people 
remember remark one classmates made going college 
totally unconscious humor thing 
said got go lectures 
losing lot sleep 
intended totally disconnected thoughts rest us knew habits almost knocked laughing 
wondering would happen nansalian drop class 
probably call ambulance something carry home fuller looked giant 
doubt 
one classmates would tuck arm take home next lecture 
remember weigh four hundred pounds nansal fifty pounds us 
true enough wade agreed 
know hate wrap arms 
might get excited sneeze something squish morbid imagination 
fuller sat one seats 
let see get three way conversation going guy interesting 
arcot morey awoke nearly three hours later earthmen ate breakfast much torlos surprise 
understand need far food commented ate hours ago 
seems like tremendous amount food 
could possibly grow enough cities farms fuller said 
food grown plains outside cities room arcot explained 
difficult machines help us 
could never developed cone type city however need huge huge quantities food 
seal inside cities people protect enemies would starve death quickly 
know morey said admit torlos people higher type creation 
man animals earth parasites plant world 
absolutely incapable producing foods 
gather energy 
utterly dependent plants 
men least much 
least generate muscular energy extracting heat air breathe 
combine best features plants reptiles mammals 
know classified biologically meal went control room strapped control seats 
arcot checked fuel gauge 
plenty lead left said morey torlos assured able get nansal 
suggest show space control works tell nansalian scientists personal experience 
sun gravitational field lose lot power long replaced right 
turning nansalian arcot pointed towards little spark light torlos home planet 
keep eyes torlos 
watch grow use space control drive 
arcot pushed little red switch first notch 
air around pulsed power instant space readjusted 
point nansal grew disc swiftly leaping toward welling meet expanding bulk awesome speed 
torlos watched tensely 
sudden splintering crash arcot jerked open circuit alarm 
almost motionless stars reeled 
torlos nervous 
like man effected unconsciously tightened muscles 
fingers sunk hard plastic arm rest chair crushed though put jaws hydraulic press glad holding hands said wade eyeing broken plastic 
sorry torlos thought humbly 
intend 
forgot saw planet rushing fast 
chagrin apparent face 
arcot laughed 
nothing torlos 
merely astonished terrific strength hand 
wade worried joking torlos looked relieved looked splintered arm rest hand 
best keep strong hands away instruments 
ship falling toward nansal relatively slow rate less four miles second 
arcot accelerated toward planet two hours began decelerate 
five hundred miles planet surface velocity cut ship descending spiral orbit allow atmosphere check speed 
outer lux hull began heat closed relux screens cut radiation 
opened ship speeding broad plains planet 
torlos told arcot far greater percentage surface nansal land 
still plenty water seas much deeper earth 
seas thirty miles deep broad areas hundreds square miles 
compensate land surfaces covered titanic mountain ranges ten miles sea level 
torlos eyes shining directed earthmen home city capital world nation 
traffic cities torlos morey asked 
seen ships 
continuous traffic torlos replied come far north well away regularly scheduled routes 
commerce must densely populated warships well warships commercial craft made look much alike possible enemy know ships war present attacks easily beaten 
forced live commerce 
invented magnetic storage device forced get fuel ships order make return journey could carry enough round trip 
suddenly smile broadened pointed forward window 
city behind next range mountains flying height twenty miles range torlos indicated far blue distance almost horizon 
approached mountains seemed change slowly perspective shifted 
seemed crawl one another like living things growing larger changing blue blue green rich verdant emerald 
soon ship rocketing smoothly 
ahead rocky gorge mountains lay great cone city largest earthmen yet seen 
approached could see another cone behind city double cone resembled circus tents two centuries earlier connected ridge 
ah home smiled torlos 
see twin cone idea new 
thus left years ago 
growing growing new section see bright colors buildings already digging foundations left third cone excited difficult arcot read thoughts coherently 
build fortifications torlos continued give us secret rays use arcot must hide hills drop deposit hills 
walk city foot 
able identify soon inside city telling supreme three salvation peace better idea arcot told 
save long walk 
make ship invisible take close city 
drop say ten feet ship ground continue 
right torlos agreed would 
invisible ancient mariner dove toward city stopping hundred feet base magnetic wall near one gigantic beam stations 
come one man flier slowly low altitude toward mountain torlos told arcot pointing 
may become visible follow city 
need fear treachery people assured 
smiling need fear treachery hands people certainly proven ability defend even people treacherously inclined would certainly convinced escape satorians 
undoubtedly heard secret radios spies 
nansalian spy others must surely escaped ships ran away destroyed city 
arcot could feel sadness mind thought fact inadvertent destruction city undoubtedly killed people 
torlos paused moment asked message wish give supreme council three yes replied arcot 
repeat offer foolishly made commanding one sator 
give molecular ray tore city ground people seen also tore mountain 
give heat beam melt anything except material ship made 
give knowledge make material 
best give secret terrific energy source known mankind energy matter 
hands sator soon peaceful 
return ask two things 
cost almost nothing invaluable us 
lost way 
vastness space longer locate galaxy 
island universe features could distinguished astronomical plate taken photographs astronomers compare help us find way back 
addition need fuel lead wire 
space control drive use energy except presence strong gravitational field drained back storage coils little loss 
used several times near large sun power drainage goes exponentially 
would enough get back home happened run trouble way 
arcot paused moment considering 
two things really need would like take back council willing 
would like samples books photographs artifacts civilization take back home people 
peace ask 
torlos nodded 
things ask sure council readily agree 
seems little enough payment things intend us 
well 
wait 
good luck torlos turned jumped airlock 
ship rose high suddenly became visible plain 
running toward city great leaps twenty feet graceful easy leaps showed tremendous power 
suddenly ship darting city toward 
curved torlos stopped made certain signals arms stood quietly hands air 
ship hovered two men dropped thirty feet ground questioned several minutes 
finally motioned ship dropped ten feet three men leaped lightly door entered 
door snapped shut ship shot toward city 
magnetic wall opened moment ship shot 
within seconds sight lost busy air traffic city 
well said arcot go back hills wait 
xx two days ancient mariner lay hidden hills 
visible time least two men watching sky every hour day 
torlos knew perfectly trustworthy know whether people honorable claimed 
arcot wade control room afternoon second day earth days forty hour nansalian days quietly discussing biological differences inhabitants planet 
suddenly wade saw slowly moving speck sky 
look arcot torlos waited ready hostile action tiny ship approached rapidly circling slowly downward came nearer 
landed hundred feet away torlos emerged running rapidly toward earth ship 
arcot let airlock 
torlos smiled broadly 
difficulty convincing council story true 
told could go faster light strongly objected 
admit certainly able tear mountain effectively received reports destruction satorian capitol 
seems first visited city thanso came 
people nearly panic stricken saw rip mountain uproot magnetic ray station 
one ship ever done fact several guards seen materialize thin air plus fact knew could make invisible convinced story true 
want talk say gladly grant requests 
must promise one thing must stay away people afraid disease 
bacteria bother much might deadly us 
supreme council three willing take risk allow anyone else exposed 
keep apart people council wishes arcot agreed real danger 
vastly different impossible get diseases us contract 
however council wants ask 
torlos went back ship headed toward city 
arcot followed ancient mariner keeping three hundred feet rear 
reached magnetic screen city one beam stations cut power moments leaving gap two ships glide smoothly 
roofs buildings men women collected watching shining polished hull strange ship moved silently 
torlos led great central building dropped huge landing field beside 
around regular rows great hulls nansal battleships arranged 
arcot landed ancient mariner shut power 
think wade man go time arcot said 
learned communicate torlos quite well 
carry pistols wear power suits 
radio communication times 
think start anything like time confident going take useless chances 
time going make arrangements 
die going costly funeral men going pay costs call every three minutes morey 
check 
still get answer take place apart able hurt us 
going tell torlos precautions 
building shields radio listening retrace steps contact 
right come wade arcot fully equipped strode corridor airlock 
torlos waiting another man torlos explained high ranking officer fleet 
torlos seemed without official rank 
secret service agent without official status therefore officer assigned accompany earthmen 
torlos seemed relaxing soft warm sunlight native world 
years since seen yellow sun except windows space flier 
could walk around clear air planet birth 
arcot explained precautions taken trouble torlos smiled 
certainly learned greater caution 
blame 
certainly seem little different men sator stand trial 
know safe 
walked across great court covered soft springy turf green 
hot sun shining brilliant colors buildings towering walls magnificent edifice approaching behind shining hull ancient mariner set among dark needle shaped nansalian ships combined make picture would remain minds long time 
guards watching conducted meeting supreme council three 
went main entrance towering government building stepped great hall ground floor 
like interior ancient gothic cathedral beautiful dignified 
great pillars green stone rose graceful fluted columns smoothly curving like branches stylized tree meet arches rose high pleasing curves point midway four pillars 
walls made dark green stone background traced designs colored tile 
whole hall thing colored beauty color gave life yellow sunlight gave life trees mountains 
crossed great hall came last elevator 
door made narrow strips metal bound together whole made flexible strong sheet 
principle doors worked like cover antique roll top desk 
idea old men made elevator doors attractive addition color 
way detract dignified grace magnificent hall 
torlos turned arcot 
wonder would wise shut radio enter elevator 
might magnetic force affect probably arcot agreed 
contacted morey told radio would cut short 
three minutes arcot finished 
know 
entered elevator torlos smiled two earthmen 
ascend gradually time acceleration tiring 
moved controls carefully gentle steps rose sixty third floor giant building 
stepped elevator torlos pointed toward open window stretched widely across one wall 
could see ancient mariner 
radio contact good torlos commented 
wade put call morey relief made contact immediately 
officer leading green stone corridor toward simple door 
opened entered room beyond 
center room large triangular table 
place center side sat one man slightly raised chair side sat number men 
torlos stopped door saluted 
spoke rapid liquid syllables men sitting table halting twice showing evident embarrassment 
paused one three men command replied rapidly pleasant voice none harsh command arcot noticed voice satorian commanding one 
arcot liked voice man 
judging earth standards past middle age whatever might nansal crisp black hair bleaching slightly 
face showed signs worry making momentous decisions always leaves although face strong authority gentleness comes feeling kindly power 
wade talking rapidly radio describing scene morey 
described great table dark wood men blue uniform military loose soft garments civilian 
colored fabrics individually good taste harmony frequently badly harmony costume neighbor difficulty accompanying brightly tinted clothing 
torlos turned arcot 
supreme council asks seated table places left 
paused quickly added told precautions said wise man received treacherously trapped 
approve policy caution 
men sit raised portions table supreme three others advisors know details science business war 
one man know branches human endeavor meeting place know best individual lines 
supreme three elected advisors case death one three act co ordinators rest 
man science left directly man business right commander military 
wish speak first arcot considered moment must first tell scientist tell commander use finally tell businessman needed 
arcot noticed military officers wore holsters pneumatic pistols conspicuously empty 
pleased embarrassed 
carried two deadly pistols 
decided least conspicuous course left 
arcot projected thoughts torlos 
come vast distance across space another galaxy 
let astronomer tell distance represents 
arcot paused torlos put thoughts words nansalian language 
moment later one scientists tall powerfully built man even men giant strength rose spoke others 
seated second rose spoke also expression puzzled wonder 
says torlos translated science taught speed say made impossible fact proves science wrong 
reasoned since kind live planet system must come another star 
since science says impossible coming another galaxy convinced fallacy theories 
arcot smiled 
sound reasoning creditable man label impossible something proven presence two earthmen 
arcot tried explain physical concepts behind space strain drive communication broke rapidly torlos warrior scientist could comprehend ideas completely unable translate language 
chief physicist suggests think directly torlos finally told arcot 
suggests thoughts might familiar 
grinned 
certainly clear arcot projected thoughts directly toward physicist surprise man perfect receiver 
natural gift 
quickly arcot outlined system made intergalactic voyage possible 
physicist smiled arcot finished tried reply good transmitter 
torlos aided 
says science people far ahead us 
conceptions totally foreign mind barely grasp significance idea bent emptiness given 
says however fully appreciate possibility shown 
given message three anxious hear weapons 
arcot drew molecular pistol holding see projected general theory operation toward physicist 
chief physicist nansal idea molecular energy old one making use life well known muscles used heat air work 
understood well worked arcot projected mind mental impression earthmen thrown one sun another realize vast power ray 
awed man translated idea fellows 
arcot drew heat pistol explained annihilation matter within converted pure heat relux lens 
show work arcot continued 
could lump metal kind scientist spoke intercom microphone within minutes large lump iron broken casting brought 
arcot suspended molecular beam wade melted heat beam 
melted collapsed ball glowed brilliantly flamed surface burned oxygen air 
wade cut heat ray ball quickly cooled influence molecular beam arcot lowered floor perfect sphere crusted ice frost 
arcot continued better part hour explain council exactly could used materials processes needed make 
finished supreme three conferred several minutes 
scientist asked torlos repay things given us first need lead fuel ship 
arcot gave exact specifications lead wire needed 
received answer man business manufacturing 
give easily lead cheap 
indeed seems hardly enough repay 
second thing need arcot continued information 
became lost space unable find way home 
would like explain case astronomer 
astronomer proved man powerful intelligence well powerful physique better transmitter receiver 
took every bit arcot powerful mind project thoughts man 
explained dilemma friends told could recognize galaxy plates 
astronomer said thought knew nebula would like compare photographs arcot make sure 
return arcot told give another weapon weapon time defeat astronomer greatest enemy distance 
electrical telescope permit see life every planet system 
see man distance ten times great distance nansal sun eagerly astronomer questioned arcot concerning telectroscope others clamoring arcot attention 
biologist foremost among contenders seemed worried possibility alien earthmen carrying pathogenic bacteria 
torlos told us entirely different internal organization 
different believe correctly understood 
arcot explained differences carefully possible 
time finished biologist felt sure creature sufficiently far removed harmless biologically wanted study man earth 
arcot brought along collection medical books possible aid case accident 
offered give nansal exchange collection nansalian medical texts 
english would worked aid dictionary primary working aid arcot would supply 
arcot also asked skeleton take biologist readily agreed 
like give one return arcot grinned brought four along unfortunately using moment 
biologist smiled back assured would think taking piece apparatus vitally necessary earthmen 
military leader man demanded attention next 
arcot long conference decided best way military leader learn war potential ancient mariner personally see demonstration powers 
council decided three would go trip 
military commander picked two aides go scientist picked astronomer physicist 
head business manufacturing declined bring advisors 
would learn nothing told arcot would way 
going one three 
well said arcot 
let get started 
xxi party descended ground floor walked ship 
filed airlock power room looked amazement tiny machines ran ship 
long black cylinder main power unit molecular drive looked weak futile compared bulky machines ran ships 
power storage coils fields intense dead blackness interested physicist immensely 
ship constant source wonder 
investigated laboratory went second floor 
morey fuller greeted door four earthmen took group around ship explaining went 
library point great interest exceeded control room 
arcot found difficulty taking care visitors four chairs control room 
three could sit arcot needed fourth chair pilot ship 
rest party hold best could difficult men physical strength accustomed high accelerations elevators 
morey wade fuller strapped seats ray projectors sides stern 
arcot wanted demonstrate effectiveness ship armament first maneuverability 
picked barren hillside first demonstration 
great rocky cliff high timber line towering almost vertically thousand feet 
wade triggered molecular projector pale beam reached toward cliff 
instantly cliff leaped ten miles air whining roaring shot atmosphere 
started fall 
heated motion air struck mountaintop mass red hot rock shattered fragments terrific roar rocks rolled bounced mountainside path traced line steam clouds 
arcot order heat beams turned mountain full power 
less minute peak began melt sending streamers lava sides 
beams began eat crater center rock began boil furiously terrific energy heat beams 
arcot shut heat beams turned molecular ray 
molecules molten rock traveling high velocities heat terrific 
arcot could see rock boiling quite freely 
molecular beam hit every one fast moving molecules shot upward together roar meteor plunged toward space five miles second dropped absolute zero beam hit speed air stay cold long arcot followed ancient mariner 
going slowly 
air slowed heated arcot hit molecular ray converting heat back velocity 
time reached free space arcot maneuvered lump rock orbit around planet 
tharlano thought astronomer planet new satellite perceive replied tharlano 
space use instrument told arcot established ship orbit twenty thousand miles planet led back observatory morey already trained telectroscope planet 
much see amplification showed rushing ground moving fast image blurred 
turned sator 
filled screen increased power could see billowing clouds 
another poor subject 
morey showed tharlano astronomer use controls began sweep sky instrument greatly pleased resolving ability tremendous magnification 
military leader three pointed satorians still weapon reported deadly imminent danger unless arcot inventions applied 
way back nansal spent time discussing problem ancient mariner library 
finally agreed necessary plans blueprints given nansalians could start production 
biggest problem supply lux relux vast energy content required atomic converters ancient mariner make 
earthmen agreed supply power necessary materials begin operations 
ship landed meeting manufacturers called 
fuller distributed prints microfilmed plans equipment packed library factory engineers worked build necessary equipment 
days followed busy days earthmen nansalians alike 
nansalians fearful consequences weapon satorians rumored 
results investigations agents far resulted death secret service men 
known exactly satorians wanted know instrument new deadly 
hand satorians entirely dark progress nansal arcot morey discovered one day 
months work designing tooling nansalian factories making tools make tools make war material needed training engineers nansal planet produce equipment needed arcot morey finally found time take days 
tharlano begun systematic search known nebulae comparing photographs earthmen given looking galaxy two satellite star clouds exactly right size distance great spiral 
months work finally picked one filled bill exactly invited arcot morey observatory confirm findings 
observatory located barren peak great mountain nine miles high 
almost perfect place astronomical telescope 
well troposphere air thin always clear 
solid rock mountain far disturbing influences might cause vibration telescope 
observatory accessible spaceship air flyer altitude pressurized sealed thin cold air outside 
within temperature kept constant fraction degree keep thermal expansion throwing mirror true 
arcot morey accompanied tharlano torlos settled ancient mariner landing field blasted rock towering mountain 
went observatory admitted airlock 
floor smoothed solid rock great clock timed moved telescope set 
entire observatory course surrounded magnetic shield necessary make sure enemy ships around using telescope magnetic field affected light rays passing 
mirror huge reflecting telescope nearly three hundred inches diameter powerful enough spot spaceship leaving sator 
military usefulness however practically nil since painting ships black made totally invisible 
half dozen assistants tharlano observatory times one charge great file plates kept hand 
every plate made printed triplicate prevent destroyed raid 
original kept observatory copies sent two largest cities nansal 
file tharlano gathered data necessary show arcot galaxy 
tharlano proudly explaining telescope arcot realizing telectroscope far better knowing earthmen would appreciate triumph mechanical perfection 
arcot morey intensely interested discussion torlos slightly bored subject knew next nothing examining rest observatory 
suddenly cried warning leaped full thirty feet rock floor gather arcot morey great arms 
sharp distinct snap pneumatic pistol thud bullet 
arcot morey felt torlos jerk quick flash torlos pushed two men behind great tube telescope 
leaped across room disappeared supply room 
noise scuffle another crack pneumatic pistol sudden crash tinkle broken glass 
suddenly figure man described wide arc flew supply room landed heavy crash floor 
instantly torlos leaped 
trickle blood left shoulder gripped man giant arms pinning floor 
struggle brief 
torlos simply squeezed man chest arms 
faint creak metal man chest began bend moment unconscious 
torlos pulled heavy leather belt unconscious man tied arms wrapping many times around wrists picking man tharlano arrived followed arcot morey 
torlos smiled broadly 
one satorian spy report 
could finished got hold wanted take council questioning 
right dented chest little 
owe lives torlos arcot told gravely 
certainly risked life bullet might well penetrated heart instead striking rib seems done 
rib rib thought concept seemed totally unfamiliar torlos 
arcot looked oddly reached ran exploratory hand torlos chest 
smooth solid morey arcot exclaimed 
men ribs chest solid skulls breathe morey asked 
breathe mean time 
use diaphragm abdominal muscles 
people morey grinned 
wonder torlos jumped front bullet much fear built bullet proof vest shoot abdomen reach vital organ 
arcot turned back torlos 
man undoubtedly satorian spy sent murder earthmen 
saw muzzle pistol aiming jumped way bullet 
much damage done 
better get back city arcot said 
fuller wade might danger bundled satorian spy ship morey tied thin strands lux cable bigger piece string 
torlos looked shook head 
break soon awakens without even knowing 
forget strength people 
morey smiled wrapped cord around torlos wrists 
torlos looked amused pulled 
smile vanished 
pulled harder 
huge muscles bulged writhed great ridges along arms 
thin cord remained complacently undamaged 
torlos relaxed grinned sheepishly 
win thought 
make comments things see 
returned capital 
arcot shoved speed high dared torlos felt might significance attempt remove arcot morey 
wade fuller already warned radio immediately retired council room three 
members investigation board joined question prisoner upon arrival 
arrived arcot morey went torlos carrying struggling shackled spy shoulder 
earthmen watched expert interrogators investigation board questioned prisoner 
philosophy norus permit torture even vicious enemy questioners shrewd ingenious methods 
hours took turns pounding questions prisoner cajoling threatening arguing 
got nowhere 
solidly prisoner stuck guns 
tried shoot earthmen know 
orders sator silence 
sator plans silence 
know anything new weapon shrug shoulders 
finally arcot spoke chief investigation officer 
may try luck think powerful enough use little combination hypnosis telepathy get information 
investigator agreed try 
arcot walked inspect prisoner 
instant man looked defiantly arcot 
arcot glared back 
time powerful mind reached began work subtly within prisoner brain 
slowly helpless blank expression came man face eyes remained fixed arcot 
man helplessly bound mentally lux cable bound physically 
full quarter hour two men earthmen satorian stood locked frozen tableau staring eyes 
onlookers waited watchful silence 
finally arcot turned shook head clear 
spy slumped forward chair unconscious 
arcot rubbed temples spoke english morey 
job tell found head splitting headache like communicate 
torlos right trying get rid four us 
ones operate ship ship defense 
knows several spies city think practically wipe satorian spy system planet information gave get others arrest 
unfortunately know anything new weapon higher ups telling anyone even men 
get idea board ships using know attack 
attack planned soon 
know 
lie readiness everything help people work 
morey relayed information investigating board council wade talking low tones arcot 
lot workmen bring twenty tons lead wire board evening distilled water tanks full 
tanks full oxygen gave us synthetic food eat 
us field chemistry 
found secret catalysis actually synthesize catalytic agent want 
make possible reaction go either direction rate desire 
took slice flesh arm analyzed last detail 
able predict sort food would need eat 
actually synthesize living things tried food made good flavor 
guaranteed would necessary ingredients right smallest trace element fully stocked long trip 
three said first consideration able return homes 
armament arcot asked 
holding head hands ease throbbing ache within 
city projector supplied regular power station top central building 
molecular ray course still enough power run heat beam 
time make one city one give satorians nasty time come near 
works nicely magnetic screen necessary lower barrier shoot 
morey finished telling council arcot discovered prisoner councilmen leaving one one go duties preparing attack 
think best go back ancient mariner arcot said 
need aspirin sleep 
agreed fuller 
men make feel though lazy 
work forty fifty hours think nothing 
snooze five hours ready another long stretch 
feel like lounge lizard take six hours every twenty four 
asked torlos stand guard ship got much needed sleep torlos consented readily getting permission supreme three 
earthmen returned ship heavy guard prevent attempts assassination 
seven hours gone sleep came 
ship came low hum rose quickly screeching call danger warning city attack xxii nansalian fleet already outside city hard 
fight arcot saw fight one sided extreme 
ship ship nansalian fleet seemed burst sudden inexplicable flame fall blazing another ships seemed though irresistible attraction drew ships together smashed blaze electric flame ships sator nothing stay far one side dodge rays nansalian ships 
quickly arcot turned torlos 
torlos go leave ship work better since worry exposure magnetic rays 
like make miss world torlos showed disappointment wanted battle 
realized earthman said true 
weak stone bones completely immune effects even powerful magnetic ray 
nodded 
go 
good luck give shots turned ran corridor airlock 
soon outside arcot lifted ship 
taken less minute get air minute nansalian fleet taken terrific beating 
arcot noticed ships sator hit smashed ground terrible blaze violet light left nothing pile fused metal 
got something right arcot thought drove ancient mariner battle 
would impossible nansalians lower magnetic screen even second arcot simply aimed ship toward turned power 
hold called struck 
ship reeled sank suddenly planetward bounced outward 
wall 
rooms suddenly oppressively hot molecular cooler struggling lower 
made morey said triumphantly eddy currents sure heated hull city speeding toward battle 
following prearranged system nansalian ships retreated leaving earthmen free hand 
needed help wade fuller morey began lash molecular beams smashing satorian ships crushing ground exploded violet flame 
wade fuller began work together 
wade caught one ship molecular ray fuller hit heat beam 
like titanic broom swept around dozens miles second leaping twisting smashing ship ship 
like snowball lump glowing metal grew crash till dozen ships fallen 
new broom swept clean magnetic beam caught ancient mariner 
shock slowed terrific rate 
arcot turned power simply dragged ship along magnetic beam wade tore ship loose molecular beam mighty mass metal broom gone glowing mass metal ground 
seen new weapon yet morey called 
find us arcot replied intercom 
sun setting blazing red star lighting ship making seem like ball fire still flashing streak red light motion 
ship ship satorians going three beams earth ship great fleet dissolving like lump sugar boiling water 
suddenly ahead enemy ship drove toward obvious intent ram magnetic beam caught drew towards would head collision 
wade caught molecular beam became blazing wreck ground 
rays arcot called 
soon arcot hit switch ancient mariner vanished 
arcot drove invisible ship high battle 
satorians searching wildly ship 
knew must somewhere near feared second might materialize deadly rays 
arcot stayed nearly minute ships twisted turned wildly seeking 
went formation started back city 
wanted arcot said grimly 
formation like sitting ducks dropped ship like plummet ray operators prepared sweep formation beams 
suddenly ancient mariner visible 
simultaneously three rays leaped bathed formation pale radiance 
front ranks vanished line broke attacking ship hung 
four magnetic beams hit ancient mariner arcot pull away four gunners tell ships holding 
men felt violent electrical shock air filled blue haze electric weapon seen instantly magnetic beams left saw behind single satorian ship heading toward surrounded bluish halo light 
suicide ship arcot accelerated away fuller hit molecular beam 
ship reeled stopped ancient mariner pulled away rapidly 
frost covered ship dead came still heading arcot turned went right like pursuing nemesis strange ship came shortest direct route molecular beams useless molecular energy left frozen hulk accelerated toward 
suddenly two envelopes blue light touched coalesced great blinding arc leaped two ships speeding satorian hull smashed violently side ancient mariner men ducked automatically hurled seat straps tremendous force 
rending crashing roar sea flame darkness 
could unconscious seconds fog went away could see glowing mass enemy ship still falling far beneath 
lux wall hit still glowing red 
morey arcot called 
right wade fuller okay morey answered 
wade fuller 
lux hull saved us arcot said 
break temperature arc bother 
since carry current get full electrical effect 
going convince birds ship made something touch give real show dived downward back battle 
show right impossible fight earth ship 
enemy concentrate four magnetic rays use electric weapon could sheer luck even little use simply lost one ships without harming ancient mariner least 
ship ship crumpled like crushed tinfoil hurled violently ground molecular beams touched 
satorian fleet fleet longer small collection disorganized ships whose commanders one thought flee ships left spearheaded space using every bit acceleration tough bodies satorians could stand 
good head start rapidly escaping 
equal acceleration said wade 
lose nope arcot said grimly 
want couple ships going get four gravities acceleration ancient mariner drove fleeing ships sator enemy ships soon dropped rapidly sight 
twenty five thousand miles space arcot cut acceleration 
catch think said softly 
pushed little red switch instant opened 
moment planet nansal huge disc behind 
tiny thing full million miles away 
took satorian fleet hour reach 
appeared dim lights telectroscope 
rapidly became larger 
arcot extinguished lights since sunward side approaching ships ancient mariner effectively invisible 
going pass us pretty good clip morey said quietly 
accelerating time 
arcot nodded agreement 
hit come toward us 
never get one passing 
ships grew rapidly plate arcot gave order fire molecular rays slashed toward onrushing ships picking fast beams could directed 
rays invisible space managed get several satorians realized happening 
panic scattered space fleeing madly impossible ship firing 
knew left behind yet waiting let go arcot said 
got specimens rest carry word back sator war 
several hours later ancient mariner approached nansal bringing two satorian ships 
careful use heat beam molecular beam earthmen managed jockey two battle cruisers back nansal 
nighttime landed 
whole area around city illuminated giant searchlights 
men working recovering bodies dead aiding survived examining wreckage 
arcot settled two satorian ships ground landed ancient mariner 
torlos sprinted ground toward saw great silver ship land 
helping examination wrecked enemy ships 
attacked anywhere else planet arcot asked opened airlock 
torlos nodded 
hit five cities use big fleet 
plan battle seems ships new weapons hit first hit cities turn 
enough make full scale attack evidently presence made desperate 
rate cities able beat magnetic beam ships projectors molecular beams 
good arcot thought 
nansal sator war practically xxiii richard arcot stepped open airlock ancient mariner walked corridor library 
found fuller wade battling silently game chess morey relaxed chair book hands 
bunch loafers arcot said acidly 
ever anything sure said fuller 
three us entered lifelong pact refrain using certain weapon would make war impossible time 
war arcot wondered 
weapon war wade grinned pointing chess board 
agreed absolutely never read minds playing chess 
morey lowered book looked arcot 
busy investigating weapon board satorian ships captured arcot told 
quite interesting effect 
nansalian scientists analyzing equipment past three days 
satorians found way cut direct electrostatic field 
energy required tremendous evidently separated charges sator carried along ships 
see would happen ship charged negatively ship next charged positively magnitude electrostatic forces terrific put two ounces iron ions positive charge north pole equivalent amount chlorine ions negatively charged south pole attraction even across distance would three hundred sixty tons located negative charges one ship positive charges one next 
mutual attraction pulled toward 
got closer charges arced across heating fusing two ships 
still enough motion toward crash 
wrecked less tenth ounce ions projected ship held automatic field ships got close enough arc 
still able analyze trick field though 
well gotten things straightened fuller said let go home anxious leave ready go arcot nodded 
except one thing 
supreme three want see us 
got meeting hour put best sunday pants 
council three arcot officially invited remain 
fleet molecular motion ships nearing completion first one roll assembly line next day wanted arcot wade morey fuller remain nansal 
large world scientist thought 
thanks people last call

spend time always must return planet 
fairly contact 
therefore make first move office suggest plaque signify coordinator first power country counselor first friend things serve 
tetrahedron chosen let

accept plaque understanding friend advisor 
much power hands one man bad 
even though trust completely might unscrupulous successor 
must return world 
first ship ready tomorrow completed friends leave planet 
return though 
ten million light years apart universe measured space anymore time 
five days apart 
nearer times sator wish others race shall come 
want come 
alone tharlano photographs route lose 
moment three spoke together scientist thinking arcot 
perhaps right 
obvious people know 
molecular ray know wars destroy 
must good race seen excellent examples 
realize desire return home ask come 
remember ten million light years five days planet 
conference ended arcot friends returned ship 
torlos waiting outside airlock 
abaout haow saon laive asked english 
tomorrow arcot said surprise 
practicing language torlos reverted telepathy 
yes came talk 
arcot man nansal visit earth anxiously hopefully hesitatingly asked 
could come back one commercial vessels come back return 
sure could earn living world hard feed know half smiled much earnest make perfect success 
arcot amazed ask 
idea would much like see fulfilled 
idea metal boned men tremendous strength strange molecular motion muscles would inspire friendship feeling kinship people earth 
man pleasant kindly sincere intelligent giant would far greater argument world nansal vivid orator would ever 
arcot asked others vote unanimous let come next day amid great ceremony first new nansalian ships came factories 
celebration four earthmen giant torlos entered ancient mariner 
ready go torlos arcot grinned
