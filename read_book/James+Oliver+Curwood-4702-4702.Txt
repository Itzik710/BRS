hour ago david carrigan vividly pictured things close big river many things may happen sixty minutes follow given minute man life 
hour ago one great purpose bring black roger audemard alive dead black roger forest fiend destroyed half dozen lives blind passion vengeance nearly fifteen years ago 
ten fifteen years thought black roger dead 
mysterious rumors lately come north

people seen 
fact followed rumor 
existence became certainty 
law took hazardous trail david carrigan messenger sent 
bring back alive dead superintendent mcvane last words 
thinking parting injunction carrigan grinned even sweat death dampened face heat afternoon sun 
end sixty minutes passed since midday pot tea grimly atrociously unexpected happened like thunderbolt azure sky 
ii huddled behind rock scarcely larger body groveling white soft sand like turtle making nest eggs carrigan told without reservation 
kept repeating comfort soul deuce fix 
head bare simply bullet taken hat away 
blond hair filled sand 
face sweating 
blue eyes alight grim sort humor though knew unless fellow ammunition ran going die 
twentieth time many minutes looked 
center flat area sand 
fifty feet river murmured gently yellow bars carpet pebbles 
fifty feet opposite side cool green wall forest 
sunshine playing seemed like laughter whimsical sort merriment roused sheer effrontery joke fate inflicted upon 
river balsam spruce rock behind cringing like rabbit afraid take open 
rock mere jutting solid floor shale 
wash sand covered like carpet four five inches deep 
could dig 
enough within reach scrape protection 
enemy hundred yards away determined wretch deadliest shot ever known 
three times carrigan made experiments prove mind sudden rush shelter timber 
three times raised crown hat slightly top rock three times marksmanship perforated neatness dispatch 
third bullet carried hat dozen feet away 
whenever showed patch clothing bullet replied unerring precision 
twice drawn blood 
humor faded carrigan eyes 
long ago exulted bigness glory country strong men met hand hand eye eye 
kind sort made profession manhunting thing reality danger expected forgot wilderness filled vision 
present situation something unlike anything ever happened previous experience outlawed

fanchet half breed robbed dozen wilderness mail sledges come nearest trapping putting business 
fanchet desperate man scruples 
even fanchet caught would cornered man bloodthirsty unfairness carrigan found cornered

scarcely four inches top rock came report rifle shale splintered hundred bits 
carrigan lowered flag gathered tighter 
accuracy marksmanship appalling 
knew exposed instant use rifle heavy automatic holster would dead man could press trigger 
time felt equally sure would come sooner later 
muscles growing cramped 
could forever double like four bladed jackknife behind altogether inefficient shelter rock 
executioner hidden edge timber directly opposite nearly hundred yards stream 
twenty times wondered fiend rifle creep timber take good open pot shot vantage point lay end straight line rock nearest spruce balsam 
angle could completely shelter 
man hundred yards moved foot ambush since fired first shot 
come carrigan crossing open space soft white sand 
left burning sensation temple half inch right would killed 
swift shot dropped behind one protection hand jutting shoulder shale 
quarter hour making efforts wriggle free bulky shoulder pack without exposing coup de grace 
last thing 
tremendous relief thrust beside rock almost doubling size shelter 
instantly came crash bullet another

everything seemed friendly 
river rippled murmured cooling song beyond sandpiper

nesting season 
heard twitter birds 
tiny brown wood warbler fluttered end silvery birch limb seemed david throat must surely burst burden song 
little fellow brown body scarcely larger butternut swelling like round ball effort vanquish song 
go old man chuckled carrigan 
go little warbler might crushed thumb forefinger gave lot courage 
tiny chorister stopped breath 
interval carrigan listened wrangling two vivid colored canada jays deeper timber 
chronic scolds never without grouch 
like people carrigan known born pessimists always finding something complain even love days 
love days 
odd thought came carrigan lay half face fingers slowly cautiously working loophole shoulder pack rock

fourth smashing eruption among comestibles culinary possessions came drive home fact even analysis situation absurd 
whoever behind rifle fire small respect contents pack surely grievous need good gun ammunition 
sticky mess condensed cream running carrigan hand
