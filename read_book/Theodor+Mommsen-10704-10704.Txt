nearly thirty years organizing province ebro tiberius sempronius gracchus spanish provinces whole enjoyed blessings peace undisturbed although mention made one two expeditions celtiberians lusitanians 
lusitanian war serious events occurred 
lusitanians leadership chief called punicus invaded roman territory defeated two roman governors united oppose slew great number troops 
vettones tagus upper douro thereby induced make common cause lusitanians thus reinforced enabled extend excursions far mediterranean pillage even territory bastulo phoenicians far roman capital new carthage cartagena 
romans home took matter seriously enough resolve sending consul spain step taken since order accelerate despatch aid even made new consuls enter office two months half legal time 
reason day consuls entering office shifted th march st january thus established beginning year still make use present day 
consul quintus fulvius nobilior army arrived serious encounter took place right bank tagus praetor lucius mummius governor spain lusitanians led fall punicus successor caesarus 
fortune first favourable romans lusitanian army broken camp taken 
romans partly already fatigued march partly broken disorder pursuit length completely beaten already vanquished antagonists lost camp addition enemy well dead 
celtiberian war flame war blazed far wide 
lusitanians left bank tagus led caucaenus threw celtici subject romans alentejo took away town conistorgis 
lusitanians sent standards taken mummius celtiberians announcement victory warning among want ferment 
two small celtiberian tribes neighborhood powerful arevacae sources douro tagus belli titthi resolved settle together segeda one towns 
occupied building walls romans ordered desist sempronian regulations prohibited subject communities founding towns discretion time required contribution money men due treaty considerable period demanded 
spaniards refused obey either command alleging engaged merely enlarging founding city contribution merely suspended remitted romans 
thereupon nobilior appeared hither spain army nearly men including numidian horsemen ten elephants 
walls new town segeda still stood unfinished inhabitants submitted 
resolute men fled wives children powerful arevacae summoned make common cause romans 
arevacae emboldened victory lusitanians mummius consented chose carus one segedan refugees general 
third day election valiant leader fallen roman army defeated nearly roman burgesses slain rd day august festival volcanalia thenceforth held sad remembrance romans 
fall general however induced arevacae retreat strongest town numantia guarray spanish league north soria douro whither nobilior followed 
walls town second engagement took place romans first means elephants drove spaniards back town thrown confusion consequence one animals wounded sustained second defeat hands enemy issuing walls 
misfortunes destruction corps roman cavalry despatched call forth contingents imparted affairs romans hither province unfavourable aspect fortress ocilis romans chest stores passed enemy arevacae position think although without success dictating peace romans 
disadvantages however measure counterbalanced successes mummius achieved southern province 
weakened though army disaster suffered yet succeeded defeating lusitanians imprudently dispersed right bank tagus passing left bank lusitanians overrun whole roman territory even made foray africa cleared southern province enemy 
marcellus northern province following year senate sent considerable reinforcements new commander chief place incapable nobilior consul marcus claudius marcellus already praetor distinguished spain since time given proof talents general two consulships 
skilful leadership still clemency speedily changed position affairs ocilis surrendered even arevacae confirmed marcellus hope peace would granted payment moderate fine concluded armistice sent envoys rome 
marcellus could thus proceed southern province vettones lusitanians professed submission praetor marcus atilius long remained within bounds departure immediately revolted afresh chastised allies rome 
arrival consul restored tranquillity spent winter corduba hostilities suspended throughout peninsula 
meanwhile question peace arevacae discussed rome 
significant indication relations subsisting among spaniards emissaries roman party subsisting among arevacae chief occasion rejection proposals peace rome representing romans willing sacrifice spaniards friendly interests alternative save either send consul corresponding army every year peninsula make emphatic example 
consequence ambassadors arevacae dismissed without decisive answer resolved war prosecuted vigor 
marcellus accordingly found compelled following spring resume war arevacae 
either asserted unwillingness leave successor expected soon glory terminating war perhaps probable believing like gracchus humane treatment spaniards first thing requisite lasting peace roman general holding secret conference influential men arevacae concluded treaty walls numantia arevacae surrendered romans discretion reinstated former rights according treaty undertaking pay money furnish hostages 
lucullus new commander chief consul lucius lucullus arrived head quarters found war come conduct already terminated formally concluded peace hopes bringing home honor especially money spain apparently frustrated 
means surmounting difficulty 
lucullus accord attacked western neighbors arevacae vaccaei celtiberian nation still independent living best understanding romans 
question spaniards fault committed answered sudden attack town cauca coca eight spanish leagues west segovia terrified town believed purchased capitulation heavy sacrifices money roman troops marched enslaved slaughtered inhabitants without pretext 
heroic feat said cost lives defenceless men army proceeded march 
far wide villages townships abandoned case strong intercatia pallantia palencia capital vaccaei closed gates roman army 
covetousness caught net community would venture conclude capitulation perfidious commander general flight inhabitants rendered booty scarce made almost impossible remain length time inhospitable regions 
front intercatia scipio aemilianus esteemed military tribune son victor pydna adopted grandson victor zama succeeded pledging word honor general longer availed inducing inhabitants conclude agreement virtue roman army departed receiving supply cattle clothing 
siege pallantia raised want provisions roman army retreat pursued vaccaei far douro 
lucullus thereupon proceeded southern province year praetor servius sulpicius galba allowed defeated lusitanians 
spent winter far lucullus territory turdetani galba conistorgis following year jointly attacked lusitanians 
lucullus gained advantages near straits gades 
galba performed greater achievement concluded treaty three lusitanian tribes right bank tagus promised transfer better settlements whereupon barbarians number came sake expected lands separated three divisions disarmed partly carried slavery partly massacred 
war hardly ever waged much perfidy cruelty avarice two generals yet means criminally acquired treasures escaped one condemnation even impeachment 
veteran cato eighty fifth year months death attempted bring galba account burgesses weeping children general gold brought home proved roman people innocence 
variathus much inglorious successes lucullus galba attained spain outbreak fourth macedonian third carthaginian war induced romans leave spanish affairs first instance ordinary governors 
accordingly lusitanians exasperated rather humbled perfidy galba immediately overran afresh rich territory turdetani 
roman governor gaius vetilius marched defeated drove whole host towards hill seemed lost irretrievably 
capitulation virtually concluded viriathus man humble origin formerly youth bravely defended flock wild beasts robbers serious conflictsa dreaded guerilla chief one accidentally escaped perfidious onslaught galba warned countrymen relying roman word honor promised deliverance would follow 
language example produced deep effect army entrusted supreme command 
viriathus gave orders mass men proceed detached parties different routes appointed rendezvous formed best mounted trustworthy corps horse covered departure men 
romans wanted light cavalry venture disperse pursuit eyes enemy horsemen 
viriathus band two whole days held check entire roman army suddenly disappeared night hastened general rendezvous 
roman general followed fell adroitly laid ambush lost half army captured slain difficulty rest troops escaped colony carteia straits 
haste men spanish militia despatched ebro reinforce defeated romans viriathus destroyed corps still march commanded absolutely whole interior carpetania romans even venture seek 
viriathus recognized lord king lusitanians knew combine full dignity princely position homely habits shepherd 
badge distinguished common soldier rose richly adorned marriage table father law prince astolpa roman spain without touched golden plate sumptuous fare lifted bride horseback rode back mountains 
never took spoil share allotted comrades 
soldier recognized general simply tall figure striking sallies wit fact surpassed every one men temperance well toil sleeping always full armor fighting front battle 
seemed thoroughly prosaic age one homeric heroes reappeared name viriathus resounded far wide spain brave nation conceived length found man destined break fetters alien domination 
successors extraordinary successes northern southern spain marked next years generalship 
destroying vanguard praetor gaius plautius viriathus skill lure right bank tagus defeat emphatically roman general went winter quarters middle summer account afterwards charged people disgraced roman community compelled live exile 
like manner army governor apparently hither province claudius unimanus destroyed gaius negidius vanquished level country pillaged far wide 
trophies victory decorated insignia roman governors arms legions erected spanish mountains people rome heard shame consternation victories barbarian king 
conduct spanish war committed trustworthy officer consul quintus fabius maximus aemilianus second son victor pydna 
romans longer ventured send experienced veterans bad returned macedonia asia forth anew tothe detested spanish war two legions maximus brought new levies scarcely trusted old utterly demoralized spanish army 
first conflicts issued favourably lusitanians prudent general kept together troops remainder year camp urso osuna south east seville without accepting enemy offer battle took field afresh following year troops petty warfare become qualified fighting enabled maintain superiority successful feats arms went winter quarters corduba 
cowardly incapable praetor quinctius took command room maximus romans suffered defeat defeat general middle summer shut corduba bands viriathus overran southern province 
successor quintus fabius maximus servilianus adopted brother maximus aemilianus sent peninsula two fresh legions ten elephants endeavored penetrate lusitanian country series indecisive conflicts assault roman camp difficulty repulsed found compelled retreat roman territory 
viriathus followed province troops wont spanish insurrectionary armies suddenly melted away obliged return lusitania 
next year servilianus resumed offensive traversed districts baetis anas advancing lusitania occupied number townships 
large number insurgents fell hands leaders executed gone roman territory enemy hands cut remaining mass sold slavery 
occasion also spanish war proved true fickle capricious character 
successes roman army attacked viriathus besieging erisane defeated driven rock wholly power enemy 
viriathus however content like samnite general formerly caudine passes conclude peace servilianus community lusitanians recognized sovereign viriathus acknowledged king 
power romans risen national sense honor sunk capital men glad rid irksome war senate people ratified treaty 
quintus servilius caepio full brother servilianus successor office far satisfied complaisance senate weak enough first authorize consul undertake secret machinations viriathus view least indulgence open breach pledged word palliation 
caepio invaded lusitania traversed land far territories vettones callaeci viriathus declined conflict superior force dexterous movements evaded antagonist 
ensuing year caepio renewed attack addition army meantime become available northern province made appearance marcus popillius lusitania viriathus sued peace terms 
required give romans passed roman territory amongst father law romans ordered executed hands cut 
sufficient romans habit announcing vanquished destined fate 
death one behest another issued lusitanians successive demand intolerable predecessors length required even surrender arms 
viriathus recollected fate countrymen galba caused disarmed grasped sword afresh 
late 
wavering sown seeds treachery among immediately around three confidants audas ditalco minucius urso despairing possibility renewed victory procured king permission enter negotiations peace caepio employed purpose selling life lusitanian hero foreigners return assurance personal amnesty rewards 
return camp assured king favourable issue negotiations following night stabbed asleep tent 
lusitanians honored illustrious chief unparalleled funeral solemnity two hundred pairs champions fought funeral games still highly fact renounce struggle nominated tautamus commander chief room fallen hero 
plan projected latter wresting saguntum romans sufficiently bold new general possessed neither wise moderation military skill predecessor 
expedition utterly broke army return attacked crossing baetis compelled surrender unconditionally 
thus lusitania subdued far treachery assassination part foreigners natives honorable war 
numantia southern province scourged viriathus lusitanians second less serious war without help broken northern province among celtiberian nations 
brilliant successes viriathus induced arevacae likewise rise romans reason consul quintus caecilius metellus sent spain relieve maximus aemilianus hot proceed southern province turned celtiberians 
contest especially siege town contrebia deemed impregnable showed ability displayed vanquishing macedonian pretender two years administration northern province reduced obedience 
two towns termantia numantia alone yet opened gates romans case also capitulation almost concluded greater part conditions fulfilled spaniards 
required however deliver arms restrained like viriathus genuine spanish pride possession well wielded sword resolved continue war daring megaravicus 
seemed folly consular army command taken consul quintus pompeius four times numerous whole population capable bearing arms numantia 
general wholly unacquainted war sustained defeats severe walls two cities preferred length procure means negotiations peace could compel 
termantia definitive agreement must taken place 
case numantines roman general liberated captives summoned community secret promise favourable treatment surrender discretion 
numantines weary war consented general actually limited demands smallest possible measure 
prisoners war deserters hostages delivered stipulated sum money mostly paid new general marcus popillius laenas arrived camp 
soon pompeius saw burden command devolve shoulders view escape reckoning awaited rome peace according roman ideas disgraceful lighted expedient merely breaking disowning word numantines came make last payment presence officers flatly denied conclusion agreement 
matter referred judicial decision senate rome 
discussed war numantia suspended laenas occupied expedition lusitania helped accelerate catastrophe viriathus foray lusones neighbors numantines 
length decision senate arrived purport war continued state became thus party knavery pompeius 
mancinus unimpaired courage increased resentment numantines resumed struggle laenas fought unsuccessfully successor gaius hostilius mancinus fortunate 
catastrophe brought much arms numantines lax wretched military discipline roman generals natural consequence annually increasing dissoluteness insubordination cowardice roman soldiers 
mere rumor moreover false cantabri vaccaei advancing relief numantia induced roman army evacuate camp night without orders seek shelter entrenchments constructed sixteen years nobilior 
numantines informed sudden departure hotly pursued fugitive army surrounded remained choice save fight way sword hand enemy conclude peace terms laid numantines 
although consul personally man honor weak little known 
tiberius gracchus served army quaestor influence celtiberians hereditary respect held account father wisely organized province ebro induced numantines content equitable treaty peace sworn staff officers 
senate recalled general immediately long deliberation caused proposal submitted burgesses convention treated formerly treated caudium words refuse ratify devolve responsibility concluded 
right category ought included officers sworn treaty gracchus others saved connections 
mancinus alone belong circles highest aristocracy destined pay penalty others guilt 
stripped insignia roman consular conducted enemy outposts numantines refused receive might part acknowledge treaty null late commander chief stood shirt hands tied behind back whole day gates numantia pitiful spectacle friend foe 
yet bitter lesson seemed utterly lost successor mancinus colleague consulship marcus aemilius lepidus 
discussions treaty mancinus pending rome attacked free people vaccaei frivolous pretexts lucullus done sixteen years began concert general province besiege pallantia 
decree senate enjoined desist war nevertheless pretext circumstances meanwhile changed continued siege 
showed bad soldier bad citizen 
lying long large strong city supplies rugged hostile country failed obliged leave behind sick wounded undertake retreat pursuing pallantines destroyed half soldiers broken pursuit early would probably utterly annihilated roman army already full course dissolution 
conduct fine imposed high born general return 
successors lucius furius philus gaius calpurnius piso wage war numantines inasmuch nothing fortunately came home without defeat 
scipio aemilianus even roman government began length perceive matters could longer continue footing resolved entrust subjugation small spanish country town extraordinary measure first general rome scipio aemilianus 
pecuniary means carrying war indeed doled preposterous parsimony permission levy soldiers asked even directly refused result towards coterie intrigues fear burdensome sovereign people may co operated 
great number friends clients voluntarily accompanied among brother maximus aemilianus whosome years commanded distinction viriathus 
supported trusty band formed guard general scipio began reorganize deeply disordered army 
first camp followers take departure found many courtesans endless number soothsayers priests sorts soldier available fighting least work trenches march 
first summer general avoided conflict numantines contented destroying stores surrounding country chastising vaccaei sold corn numantines compelling acknowledge supremacy rome 
towards winter scipio drew together army round numantia 
besides numidian contingent horsemen infantry twelve elephants led prince jugurtha numerous spanish contingents four legions force men investing city whose citizens capable bearing arms exceed 
nevertheless besieged frequently offered battle scipio perceiving clearly disorganization many years repaired refused accept conflicts occur connection sallies besieged cowardly flight legionaries checked difficulty appearance general person justified tactics forcibly 
never general treat soldiers contemptuously scipio treated numantine army showed opinion bitter speeches course action 
first time romans waged war means mattock spade depended alone whether use sword 
around whole circuit city wall nearly three miles length constructed double line circumvallation twice extent provided walls towers ditches river douro first supplies reached besieged efforts bold boatmen divers length closed 
thus town venture assault could well fail reduced famine possible citizens lay provisions last summer

another district sicily cleon cilician slave formerly native land daring bandit followed example set occupied agrigentum leaders came mutual understanding gaining various minor advantages succeeded last totally defeating praetor lucius hypsaeus person army consisting mostly sicilian militia capturing camp

appointment official commission counteract dangerous diminution farmer class comprehensive establishment new small holdings whole italian landed property disposal state doubtless sign healthy condition national economy existing circumstances political social suited purpose 
distribution domains moreover political party question might carried last sod without changing existing constitution shaking government aristocracy 
little could case complaint violation rights 
state confessedly owner occupied land holder possessor mere sufferance could rule ascribe even bonafide proprietary tenure exceptional instances could confronted fact roman law prescription run state 
distribution domains abolition exercise right property jurists agreed formal legality

objections raised day great landlord suddenly begins assert compass claims belonging law suffered long period lie dormant practice might equal better right advanced rogation gracchus 
occupied domains undeniably heritable private possession three hundred years state proprietorship soil nature loses readily burgess character private right case lands become virtually extinct present holders universally come possessions purchase onerous acquisition 
jurist might say would men business measure appeared ejection great landholders benefit agricultural proletariate fact statesman could give name 
leading men catonian epoch formed judgment clearly shown treatment similar case occurred time

granted objections sempronian agrarian law small weight 
yet decisive 
practical eviction holders domains certainly great evil yet means checking least long time evil much greater still fact directly destructive state decline italian farmer class

agrarian laws colony capua transmarine colonialization true italian domain question certain sense settled 
agrarian law tiberius even theallotment commission still continued legally force agrarian law carried gracchus enacted nothing new save restoration commissioners jurisdiction lost

chapter iv rule restoration vacancy government new structure gaius gracchus reared became death ruin

gaius departed world childless son tiberius left behind died reaching manhood whole popular party called literally without one could named leader 
gracchan constitution resembled fortress without commander walls garrison uninjured general wanting one take possession vacant place save government overthrown 
restored aristocracy accordingly happened 
decease gaius gracchus without heirs government senate spontaneously resumed place natural strict sense formally abolished tribune merely reduced practical nullity exceptional proceedings 
yet greatly err discern restoration nothing relapse state machine old track trodden worn centuries 
restoration always revolution case much old government old governor restored 
oligarchy made appearance newly equipped armor tyrannis overthrown 
senate beaten gracchus field weapons continued essential points govern constitution gracchi though certainly ulterior idea setting aside entirely rate thoroughly purging due time elements really hostile ruling aristocracy 
prosecutions democrats first reaction mainly directed persons

gaius carbo ally gracchi long convert recently shown zeal usefulness defender opimius

thus men reaction showed personal questions pure aristocrats 
reaction immediately attack distributions grain taxation province asia gracchan arrangement jurymen courts contrary spared mercantile class proletariate capital continued render homage already done introduction livian laws powers especially proletariate far decidedly done gracchi 
course adopted merely gracchan revolution still thrilled long minds contemporaries protected creations fostering cherishing least interests populace fact perfectly compatible personal advantage aristocracy thereby nothing sacrificed merely public weal

judicious regulations injurious character occupation system moreover long ago given length officially recognized unhappily adopted already deprived state substance domanial possessions 
roman aristocracy thus took care got whatever occupied land still hands converted property time pacified italian allies indeed conferring property latin domain land especially municipal aristocracy enjoyed preserving unimpaired rights relation guaranteed charters

new military organization held hand formidable weapon newly organized army 
previously time fundamental principle servian constitution levy limited entirely burgesses possessed property distinctions armor regulated solely property qualification necessarily various respects relaxed 
minimum census asses pounds bound possessor enter burgess army lowered pounds 
older six property classes distinguished respective kinds armor restricted three accordance servian organization selected cavalry wealthiest light armed poorest liable serve arranged middle class proper infantry line longer according property according age service three divisions hastati principes triarii 
moreover long ago brought italian allies share great extent war service case among roman burgesses military duty chiefly imposed propertied classes 
nevertheless roman military system time marius rested main primitive organization burgess militia 
longer suited altered circumstances 
better classes society kept aloof service army roman italic middle class general disappearing hand considerable military resources extra italian allies subjects become available italian proletariate also properly applied afforded least useful material military objects 
burgess cavalry meant formed class wealthy practically ceased service field even time marius 
last mentioned actual corps armee spanish campaign drove general despair insolent arrogance insubordination war broke troopers general waged sides equal unscrupulousness 
jugurthine war continues appear merely sort guard honor general foreign princes thenceforth wholly disappears 
like manner filling complement legions properly qualified persons bound serve proved ordinary course things difficult exertions necessary battle arausio would probability really impracticable retention existing rules obligation service

therefore simply necessary consequence political social changes state military arrangements exhibit transition system burgess levy system contingents enlisting cavalry light troops essentially formed contingents subjects cimbrian campaign instance contingents summoned far bithynia case infantry line former arrangement obligation service abolished every free born burgess time permitted voluntarily enter army first done marius 
added reducing infantry line level likewise referred marius 
roman method aristocratic classification hitherto prevailed also within legion 
four divisions velites hastati principes triarii may say vanguard first second third line hitherto possessed special qualification service respected property age great part also distinctive equipment definite place assigned order battle definite military rank standard 
distinctions superseded 
one admitted legionary needed qualification order serve division discretion officers alone decided place 
distinctions armor set aside consequently recruits uniformly trained 
connected doubtless change various improvements marius introduced armament carrying baggage similar matters furnish honorable evidence insight practical details business war care soldiers especially new method drill devised publius rutilius rufus consul comrade marius african war 
significant fact method considerably increased military culture individual soldier essentially based upon training future gladiators usual fighting schools time 
arrangement legion became totally different 
thirty companies manipuli heavy infantry two sections centuriae composed respectively men first two men third division hitherto formed tactical unit replaced cohorts cohortes standard often sections men apiece although time men saved suppression light infantry legion yet total numbers legion raised men 
custom fighting three divisions retained previously division formed distinct corps future left general distribute cohorts disposal three lines thought best 
military rank determined solely numerical order soldiers divisions 
four standards several parts legion wolf ox man head horse boar hitherto probably carried cavalry three divisions heavy infantry disappeared came instead ensigns new cohorts new standard marius gave legion whole silver eagle 
within legion every trace previous civic aristocratic classification thus disappeared distinctions henceforth occurring among legionaries purely military accidental circumstances decades earlier given rise privileged division army alongside legions bodyguard general 
hitherto selected men allied contingents formed personal escort general employment roman legionaries even men voluntarily offering personal service variance stern disciplinary obligations mighty commonwealth 
numantine war reared army demoralized beyond parallel scipio aemilianus called check wild disorder able prevail government call entirely new troops arms least allowed form addition number men dependent kings free cities outside roman bounds placed disposal personal escort men composed volunteer roman burgesses p 
cohort drawn partly better classes partly humbler personal clients general hence called sometimes friends sometimes headquarters praetoriani duty serving latter praetorium return exempt camp entrenching service enjoyed higher pay greater repute 
political significance marian military reform complete revolution constitution roman army seems certainly substance originated purely military motives whole much work individual least man calculating ambition remodelling force circumstances enjoined arrangements become untenable 
probable introduction system inland enlistment marius saved state military point view destruction several centuries afterwards arbogast stilicho prolonged existence time introduction foreign enlistment 
nevertheless involved complete although yet developed political revolution 
republican constitution essentially based view citizen time soldier soldier citizen end soon soldier class formed

marius engagement raudine plain unconstitutionally gave roman citizenship field battle two cohorts italian allies en masse brave conduct justified afterwards saying amidst noise battle able distinguish voice laws

twelve eagles circled round palatine hill ushered reign kings new eagle gaius marius bestowed legions proclaimed near advent emperors 
political projects marius hardly doubt marius entered brilliant prospects military political position opened 
sad troubled time 
men peace glad state things formerly first mighty onset men north rome soon crisis energies roused anew fresh consciousness recovered health vigorous development rapidly amply made lost 
every one felt though able generals might still avert immediate destruction commonwealth surely way ruin government restored oligarchy every one felt also time past cases burgess body came help amendment long place gaius gracchus remained empty 
deeply multitude felt blank left disappearance two illustrious youths opened gates revolution childishly fact grasped shadow substitute shown case pretended son tiberius gracchus although sister two gracchi charged fraud open forum yet chosen people tribune solely account usurped name 
spirit multitude exulted presence gaius marius one seemed right man rate first general popular name time confessedly brave upright recommended regenerator state position aloof proceedings party people held public opinion decidedly possible favored opposition 
significant indication proposal vacant stalls chief priestly colleges filled burgesses instead colleges government frustrated comitia suggestion religious scruples carried gnaeus domitius without senate able even venture serious resistance 
whole seemed nothing wanted chief give opposition firm rallying point practical aim found marius 
execution task two methods operation offered marius might attempt overthrow oligarchy either imperator head army mode prescribed constitution constitutional changes past career pointed former course precedent gracchus latter 
easy understand adopt former plan perhaps even think possibility adopting senate seemed powerless helpless hated despised marius conceived scarcely need support opposing immense popularity hoped case necessity find support notwithstanding dissolution army soldiers discharged waiting rewards 
probable marius looking gracchus easy apparently almost complete victory resources far surpassing gracchus deemed overthrow constitution four hundred years old intimately bound manifold habits interests body politic arranged complicated hierarchy far easier task 
one looked deeply difficulties enterprise marius probably might reflect army although course transition militia body mercenaries still state transition means adapted blind instrument coup etat attempt set aside resisting elements military means would probably augmented power resistance antagonists 
mix organized armed force struggle could appear first glance superfluous second hazardous beginning crisis antagonistic elements still far reached last shortest simplest expression 
popular party marius therefore discharged army triumph accordance existing regulation entered course traced gaius gracchus procuring supremacy state undertaking constitutional magistracies 
enterprise found dependent support called popular party sought allies leaders time victorious general means possessed gifts experiences requisite command streets 
thus democratic party long insignificance suddenly regained political importance 
long interval gaius gracchus marius materially deteriorated 
perhaps dissatisfaction senatorial government less several hopes brought gracchi faithful adherents meanwhile recognized illusory sprung many minds misgiving gracchan agitation tended towards issue whither large portion discontented means willing follow

moreover present moment presented comparatively favourable prospects general insurrection throughout italy 
exactly informed far romans carried dissolution larger italian confederacies improbable marsians paelignians perhaps even samnites lucanians still associated old communal leagues though lost political significance cases probably reduced mere fellowship festivals sacrifices
