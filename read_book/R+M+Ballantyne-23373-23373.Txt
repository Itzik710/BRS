whole party cautiously clambered raft sank deep scarcely dared move 
make matters worse clearly distinguished steamer whistle going farther farther away searching wrong direction 
indeed case although shouted singly together whistle grew fainter degrees finally died away 
feelings approaching despair crew frail raft began talk prospect silenced slight movement mist 
white curtain lifted yards revealed almost incredulous eyes rocky shore backed range precipitous cliffs wild mountainous region beyond 
sea still perfectly calm surf
