note late mr allan quatermain friend whose hands hope manuscripts mine pass one day one something say 
long ago jotted history events details less completeness 
satisfaction 
noted memory fails us advance years recollect almost painful exactitude experienced saw youth happenings middle life slip away us become blurred like stretch low lying landscape overflowed gray nebulous mist 
far sun still seems shine upon plains hills adolescence early manhood yet shines us fleeting hours age ground stand day valley filled fog 
yes even prominences symbolise startling events past often lost confusing fog 
appreciation truths led set following details though course much omitted brief intercourse strange splendid creature knew names ayesha h ya commands indeed view publication forgot wished might peruse evening old age hope attain 
indeed time last thing intended given world even death many unusual feared lest cause smiles way cast slur upon memory truthfulness 
also read matter made promise always tried keep promises guard secrets others 
reasons proposed case neglected forgot destroy leave direction done executors 
careful make allusion whatever either casual conversation anything else may written desire page life kept quite private something known 
therefore never much hinted anyone even told much 
well recorded main facts concerning expedition issues simply much exactness could laid aside 
say never thought since amongst together problems suggested proved unforgettable nature 
also whenever ayesha sayings stories preserved pages came back happened time time jotted put away manuscript 
thus among notes find history city k r told omitted 
still many remarkable events less fade mind image unfixed photograph till outlines remained faint distinguishable 
tell truth rather ashamed whole story cut poor figure 
reflection obvious although honesty compelled set essential exactly occurred adding nothing taking nothing away victim gross deceit 
strange woman met ruins place called k r without doubt thrown glamour senses moment almost caused believe much quite unbelievable 
instance told ridiculous stories interviews certain heathen goddesses though true almost next breath qualified contradicted 
also suggested life prolonged far beyond mortal span hundreds hundreds years indeed euclid says absurd pretended supernatural powers still absurd 
moreover clever use hypnotic mesmeric power feigned transport place beyond earth halls hades show veiled eyes man savage warrior umhlopekazi commonly called umslopogaas axe hans hottentot companion upon adventure 
like things equally incredible appearance seemed lost battle troll like rezu 
omit sum shamefully duped anyone finds position people one time another lives wisdom suggests better keep circumstances 
well matter stood rather lay recesses mind cupboard hide papers one evening someone matter fact captain good individual romantic tendencies fond sometimes think fond fiction brought book house insisted really must peruse 
ascertaining novel declined tell truth fond romance shape person found hard facts life sufficient interest stand 
reading admit like matter everything else range limited 
study bible especially old testament sacred lessons majesty language inspired translators whereof ayesha render poorly flowing melodious arabic reminded 
poetry turn shakespeare end scale ingoldsby legends many know almost heart current affairs content newspapers 
rest peruse anything ancient egypt happen come across land history queer fascination perhaps roots occurrences dreams place speak 
lastly read one latin greek authors translation since regret say lack education enable original 
modern fiction taste although time time sample railway train occasionally amused excursions poetic unreal 
came good bothered read particular romance determined would nothing sort 
persistent person however went away ten clock night deposited side nose indeed might overlooked 
thus came could help seeing egyptian hieroglyphics oval cover also title underneath name friend excited curiosity especially title brief enigmatic consisting indeed one word 
took work opening first thing eye fell upon picture veiled woman sight made heart stand still painfully remind certain veiled woman fortune meet 
glancing printed page one word seemed leap 
k r veiled women plenty world also two k rs turned beginning began read 
happened autumn sun rise till six broad daylight ceased reading rather rushing book 
oh make pages say nothing old billali way lied probably order told mr holly white man visited country many generations gloomy man eating amahagger scoundrels found face face commands rendered must obeyed means much thing case least yes ayesha lovely mystic changeful imperious 
moreover history filled many gaps limited experiences enigmatical half divine though think rather wicked rate unmoral way yet woman 
true showed lights different higher presented 
yet substratum character rather characters seemed several single body said one many everywhere 
found story kallikrates set mere falsehood invented bewilderment expanded explained 
rather explained since perhaps might deceive spoken murdered kallikrates without enthusiasm handsome person indiscretion youth bound destiny whose return somewhat sorrow must wait 
least first though end bared heart moment farewell vowed loved appointed divine decree 
also found things knew nothing fire life fatal gift indefinite existence although remember like giant rezu umslopogaas defeated talk cup life drunk might offered lips politic bowed knee shown faith supernatural pretensions 
lastly saw story end read wept yes confess wept although feel sure return 
understood quailed even seemed shrivel last interview stung beyond endurance witcheries sarcasms suggested even powers fate might reserve one shrewdest blows 
prescience told words seemed random truth spoke lips although worst know weapon would deal stroke doomed fall 
amazed overcome closed book made mind first would continue preserve absolute silence ayesha dealings life bound oath secondly would cause manuscript destroyed 
feel right view already published world 
let lie appear one day appear might fated 
meanwhile lips sealed 
would give good back book without comment buy another copy one word 
clear touch fringe real ayesha 
thousand ways bewitched deceived never plumbed nature depths 
perhaps fault first shewed lack faith wished pay back fashion perhaps private reasons secrecy 
certainly character discovered differed many ways revealed mr holly leo vincey kallikrates seems slew jealousy rage 
told much thought fit know allan quatermain 
grange yorkshire 
allan chapter talisman believe old egyptians wise people probably indeed much wiser know leisure ample centuries time think things declared individual personality made six seven different elements although bible allows us three namely body soul spirit 
body man woman wore understand theory aright perhaps ignorant person kind sack fleshly covering containing different principles 
mayhap contain simply house lived time time seldom together although one present continually though keep place warmed aired 
casual illustrative suggestion right allan quatermain little reading probably erroneous deductions form judgment theories old egyptians still understand suffice furnish text man one many connection may remembered often scripture spoken home many demons seven think 
also come another far example zulus talk witch doctors inhabited multitude spirits 
anyhow one thing quite sure always 
different personalities actuate us different times 
one hour passion sort lord another reason 
one hour follow basest appetites another hate spirit arising mortal murk shines within us like star 
one hour desire kill spare another filled holiest compassion even towards insect snake ready forgive like god 
everything rules us turn extent indeed sometimes one begins wonder whether really rule anything 
reason homily allan practical unimaginative persons homely half educated hunter trader chances seen good deal particular little world lot cast one period life became victim spiritual longings 
man suffered great bereavements time seared soul since perhaps rather primitive simple nature affections strong 
day night never forget loved believe loved 
know vanity us apt hold certain people intimate upon earth really care us still greater vanity called madness imagine still care us left earth entered new state society surroundings exist inferentially much congenial experienced 
times however cold doubts strike us matter long know truth 
also behind looms still blacker doubt namely whether live 
years lonely existence problems haunted day day till length desired everything earth lay rest one way another 
durban met man spiritualist confided little perplexities 
laughed said could settled greatest ease 
visit certain local medium fee one guinea would tell everything wanted know 
although rather grudged guinea usually hard time called upon person results visit rather lack draw veil 
queer perhaps unwholesome longing however remained would abated 
consulted clergyman acquaintance good spiritually minded man could shrug shoulders refer bible saying quite rightly doubt reveals ought contented 
read certain mystical books recommended 
full fine words undiscoverable pocket dictionary really took forwarder since found nothing could invented although actually studying seemed convince 
even tackled swedenborg rather samples copious without satisfactory results 
ha jb gave business 
months later zululand near black kloof dwelt paid visit acquaintance written elsewhere wonderful ancient dwarf zikali known thing never born also universally among zulus opener roads 
talked many things connected state zululand politics rose leave waggon since never cared sleeping black kloof could avoided

even last moment meant go tribute demanded saw best passed word could altered 
indeed felt sure event would trouble oxen would stolen worse 
fate issued decree hans version zikali great medicine arranged things shrugged shoulders waited 
chapter iii umslopogaas axe next morning dawn guides arrived town axe bringing yoke spare oxen showed chief really anxious see 
due course inspanned started guides leading us rough practicable road steep hillside saucer like plain beneath saw many cattle grazing

ancient law man day year may fight chieftainship fought conquered held take life axe though late none seems like business 
law made guns men like macumazahn said hit lizard wall fifty paces

chapter iv lion axe next day early left town people axe bid formal farewell umslopogaas saying voice could hear rivers still flooded proposed trek northern parts zululand trade weather better 
private arrangement however night next full moon happened four weeks later meet eastern foot certain great flat topped mountain known us stands north zululand well beyond borders 
northward trekked slowly spare oxen trading went 
details matter happened met luck upon journey come way many long year 
although worked credit since nearly goods sold owing repute could always zululand made excellent bargains cattle top bought large lot ivory cheap really think must stolen 
cattle ivory together sent natal charge white friend mine could trust stuff sold well indeed proceeds paid account trade equivalents duly remitted native vendors 
fact good fortune superstitious like hans inclined attribute influence zikali great medicine 
knew one chances trader life accepted shrug often accustomed alternative losses 
one untoward incident happened 
sudden party king soldiers command well known induna councillor arrived insisted upon searching waggon thought first connection cheap lot ivory already departed natal 
however never word say ivory indeed single thing belonging taken 
indignant expressed feelings induna measured terms 
part apologetic explained obliged king orders 
also let slip seeking certain evil doer thought might without knowing real character evil doer whose name would mention fierce man necessary bring strong guard 
bethought umslopogaas merely looked blank shrugged shoulders saying habit consorting evil doers 
still unsatisfied induna questioned places journey mine zulu country 
told utmost frankness mentioning among others sure already knew movements well town people axe 
asked seen chief certain umslopogaas bulalio 
answered yes met first time thought remarkable man 
induna agreed emphatically saying perhaps know remarkable 
next asked replied faintest idea presumed kraal left 
induna explained kraal gone away leaving one lousta head wife monazi administer chieftainship stated wished make journey 
yawned weary subject chief indeed whole business 
induna said must come king repeat words spoken 
replied could possibly finished trading arranged go north shoot elephants 
answered elephants lived long would die visiting king 
followed argument grew heated ended declaring king must come even take force 
sat silent wondering say leaned forward pick piece wood fire wherewith light pipe 
shirt buttoned chanced action caused ivory image zikali hung neck appear edges 
induna saw eyes grew big fear

next morning dawn went also trekked steadily clear zululand 
due course without accident weather wet turned beautifully fine dry came great flat topped hill mentioned trekking thither high sparsely timbered veld offered difficulties waggon 
peculiar hill known natives lived parts long word means hut flat roof surrounded forest trees grow wonderfully well perhaps water flows slopes

indeed cattle kraal still remained good condition piling stones walls closing narrow entrances thorn bushes could still use enclose oxen night 
fear lest lions though neither seen heard 
days went pleasantly enough lots eat since whenever wanted meat go yards shoot fat buck spot whither trekked drink evening till last came time full moon

thus came mountains spot discovered pass came swamps ridge high ground ran forth

chapter vi sea cow hunt intention push forward across river luck old friend fate 
begin several umslopogaas men fell sick kind stomach trouble arising doubt something eaten 
however view umslopogaas 
happened one men goroko name practiced witch doctor lighter moments naturally suspected spell cast upon people see magic everything 
therefore organised smelling umslopogaas superstitious rest assisted 
hans although called christian partly curiosity curious magpie partly fear lest implication brought absence 
saw business going little distance unseen thought well keep eye upon proceedings case anything untoward occur 
miss inez never witnessed anything sort companion 
circle small one formed usual fashion goroko rigged best witch doctor costume could improvise duly came influence spirit skipped waving wildebeeste tail forth 
finally horror broke ring running group spectators village switched thomaso standing among lordly contemptuous air across face gnu tail shouting wizard poisoned bowels sick men 
thereon thomaso although could insolent like crossbreeds remarkable courage seeing stir announcement created amongst fierce faced zulus fearing developments promptly bolted none attempting follow 
thought everything time come speak earnest words umslopogaas pointing matters must go regards thomaso knew people hated goroko went back circle seized new burst inspiration 
throwing whisk lifted arms head stared heavens 
began shout something loud voice far catch 
whatever may evidently frightened hearers could see expressions faces 
even umslopogaas alarmed let axe fall moment rose though speak sat covered eyes hands

circle broke members began talk subdued way umslopogaas remained seated ground brooding hans slipped away snake like fashion doubtless search 
mr quatermain asked inez 
oh lot nonsense said 
fancy witch doctor declared friend thomaso put something men food make sick 
daresay would like mr quatermain know hates especially umslopogaas fond 
brought beautiful flowers morning found somewhere made long speech could understand

left see something went speak hans asked happened 
something rather queer think baas answered vacuously though quite understand last part 
doctor goroko smelt thomaso man made sick though kill guests zulus angry thomaso think beat get chance 
small half stick paused 
big half asked irritation 
baas spirit goroko jackass goroko mean interrupted 
christian talk rubbish spirits wish father could hear 
oh baas reverend father predikant wise enough know spirits come black witch doctors though turn noses white men leave alone 
however whatever makes goroko speak got hold lips said though remembered nothing afterwards soon place would red blood would great killing baas 

red blood whose blood fool mean know baas call jackass goroko declared great medicine meaning wear baas quite safe 
hope blood also get place soon 
well scolded hans believed doctor said could see believe went question umslopogaas found looking quite pleased annoyed still 
goroko saying smile bulalio asked 
nothing much macumazahn except man looks like tallow gone bad put something food made us sick would kill red beard servant would frighten lady daughter 
also said soon fighting smiled grow weary peace 
came fight certainly answered 
came make quiet journey strange lands mean 
ah well macumazahn strange lands one meets strange men one always agree inkosikaas begins talk whirled great axe round head making air whistle forced gouge back 
could get extracted promise nothing happen thomaso pointed probably quite unjustly accused went away 
still whole incident left disagreeable impression mind began wish safe across zambesi without trouble 
could start two zulus still well enough travel many preparations made loads forth since waggon must left behind 
also another complication hans sore upon foot resulting prick poisonous thorn desirable quite healed marched 
came really glad captain robertson suggested go certain swamp formed gathered small tributary zambesi take part kind hippopotamus battue 
seemed season year great animals always frequented place numbers also barring neck deep water gained proportion could cut killed 
done twice past though late perhaps captain robertson lacked energy organise hunt 
wished taking advantage presence value hides sea cows cut sent coast sold sjamboks whips sport thing 
also think desired show altogether sunk sloth drink 
fell idea readily enough since hunting life never seen anything sort especially told expedition would take week reckoned sick men hans would fit travel sooner 
great preparations made 
riverside natives whose share spoil carcases slain sea cows summoned hundreds sent appointed stations beat swamps signal given firing great pile reeds 
also many things done upon need enter 
came time us depart appointed spot twenty miles away distance seemed could trek waggon 
captain robertson time cut gin active affair though command mail steamer 
nothing escaped attention indeed care gave details reminded captain great ship leaving port learned able man must 
daughter accompany us asked night started 
oh answered would way 
quite safe especially thomaso hunter remains charge place older natives look women children 
later saw inez said would liked come although hated see great beasts killed father thought might catch fever 
supposed better remain 
agreed though heart doubtful said would leave hans whose foot yet quite well made friends done umslopogaas look 
also would two great zulus recovering attack stomach sickness would nothing fear 
answered slow smile feared nothing still would liked come us 
parted proved long time 
quite ceremony 
umslopogaas name axe solemnly gave inez charge two followers bidding guard much earnestness began suspect feared something choose mention 
mind went back indeed prophecy witch doctor goroko possible might thinking spoke kept fierce eyes fixed upon fat pompous quarter breed thomaso concluded object doubts 
might occurred thomaso would take opportunity father absence annoy inez 
sure mistaken various reasons need quote one namely even idea ever entered head thomaso far great coward translate action 
still suspecting something also gave hans instructions keep sharp eye inez generally watch place saw anything suspicious communicate us 
yes baas said hans look sad eyes usual quickness observation zulus named inez though grandmother though fear know 
baas would much rather come look reverend father predikant told always duty girl herding baas 
also foot quite well want shoot sea cows paused 
hans goroko said going much fighting fighting come harm protect would reverend father think meant two things hans never liked separated could help much preferred shooting trip stopping alone strange place nothing except eat sleep 
concluded though indeed get quite bottom business 
reality hans putting gallant struggle temptation 
found afterwards captain robertson giving strong drink sly moved thereto sympathy fellow toper 
also shown wanted could get hans always wanted gin badly indeed 
leave within reach like leaving handful diamonds lying room thief 
knew ashamed tell truth thence came much trouble 
stop hans look young lady nurse foot said sternly whereon collapsed sigh asked tobacco 
meanwhile captain robertson think taking stirrup cup cheer road making farewells known village saw kissing collection half breed children giving thomaso instructions look mothers 
returning length called inez remained upon veranda always seemed shrink father visits village keep stiff upper lip feel lonely commanded cavalcade start 
went twenty village natives motley crew armed every kind gun marching ahead singing songs 
came waggon captain robertson seated driving box lastly umslopogaas zulus except two left behind 
trekked along kind native road fine veld character strathmuir stood lower lying bush veld ran zambesi right 
nightfall came ridge whereon bush veld turned south fringing tributary great river swamps hunt sea cows 
camped next morning leaving waggon charge voorlooper couple strathmuir natives driver act gun bearer marched sea bush veld 
proved full game dared fire fearing disturbing hippopotami swamps beneath whence event might escape us back river 
midday passed bush veld reached place drive 
bordered steep banks covered bush swampy ground two hundred yards wide center ran narrow channel rather deep water draining vast expanse morass 
channel sea cows traveled feeding ground loved collect season year 
assistance riverside natives made preparations direction captain robertson 
rest men number several hundreds made wide tour head swamps miles away whence advance certain signal 
preparations simple 
quantity thorn trees cut means heavy stones fastened trunks anchored narrow channel deep water 
tops floated placid surface tied variety rags brought us old red flannel shirts gay colored worn blankets know besides 
fragments also attached anchored ropes water 
also selected places guns upon steep banks mentioned channel ran 
foreseeing would happen chose one behind particularly stout rock built stone wall height several feet landward side guessed natives posted near would prove wild shooting 
labors occupied rest day night retired higher ground sleep 
dawn following morning returned took stations one side channel reach canoe brought purpose river natives 
sun rose captain robertson fired huge pile dried reeds bushes give signal river natives far away begin beat 
done sat waited making sure every gun plenty ammunition ready 
dawn broke climbing tree near schanze shelter saw good many miles away south wide circle little fires guessed natives beginning burn dry reeds swamp 
presently fires drew together thin wall flame 
knew time return schanze prepare 
full daylight however anything happened 
watching still channel water saw ripples bubbles air rising 
suddenly appeared head great bull hippopotamus caught sight rag barricade either water risen surface see might 
put bullet eight bore rifle brain whereon sank guessed stone dead bottom channel thus helping increase barricade bulk great body 
also another effect 
observed sea cows bear smell taint blood frightens horribly expose almost risk rather get nostrils 
still water perceptible current blood dead bull soon spread herd following leader began arrive much alarmed 
indeed first winding tasting turned tried get back channel however met others following ensued tremendous confusion 
rose surface blowing snorting bellowing scrambling water continually arrived behind till perfect pandemonium narrow place 
guns opened fire wildly upon mass like battle smoke caught sight riverside natives acting beaters advancing far away fantastically dressed screaming excitement waving spears sometimes torches flaming reeds 
scrambling along banks bolder spirits advanced lagoon canoes driving hippopotami towards mouth channel alone could escape great swamps river 
hunting experience think ever saw remarkable scene 
still way unpleasant flatter sportsman battle sort sport understand term 
length came channel quite long way literally full hippopotami think must hundred sorts sizes great bulls little calves 
killed many shooting gallant company execrable almost hazard 
also every sea cow died number think captain robertson accounted many wounded 
still unhappy beasts crazed noise fire blood seem dare face frail barricade probably reason given 
remained massed together water making horrible noise 
sudden seemed take resolution 
broke back towards burning reeds screaming beaters advancing canoes 
one indeed wounded bull charged canoe crushed huge jaws killed rower exactly know body never found 
majority however took another counsel emerging water either side began scramble towards us along steep banks even climb surprising agility 
point proceedings congratulated earnestly upon solid character water worn rock selected shelter 
behind rock together gun bearer umslopogaas shoot elected companion crouched banged away unwieldy creatures advanced 
fire fast might two rifles could stop half drawing unpleasantly near 
glanced umslopogaas even amused see probably first time life redoubtable warrior genuine fright 
madness macumazahn shouted din 
stop stamped flat horde water pigs seems answered unless prefer stamped flat outside eaten added pointing great crocodile also emerged channel coming along towards us open jaws 
axe shouted umslopogaas warrior die thus trodden like slug ox 
mentioned tree climbed 
extremity umslopogaas rushed tree went like lamplighter crocodile wriggled past trunk snapping retreating legs 
took note partly advancing sea cows reason one village natives posted firing wildly put large round bullet sleeve coat 
indeed wall built protected us certain bearer would killed afterwards found splashed lead bullets struck stones 
well thanks strength rock wall hans said afterwards zikali great medicine escaped unhurt 
rush went indeed killed one sea cow close powder rifle actually burned hide 
go leaving us untouched 
however fortunate since village natives two trampled death third leg broken 
also really amusing bewildered bull charging full speed crashed trunk umslopogaas tree thick snapped two 
came top dignified chief ensconced like bird nest though moment precious little dignity 
however except scratches hurt hippopotamus business urgent need attention stop settle 
things happen man mixes matters knows nothing said umslopogaas sententiously afterwards 
could never bear allusion tree climbing episode martial career happened taken place full view retainers among remained greatest jokes 
indeed wanted kill man wag party gave slang name translated means brave dares ride water horse tree 
last thanked providence devoutly 
good many sea cows dead think twenty one exact bag majority escaped one way another many fear wounded 
imagine last bulk herd overcame fears swimming screen passed away channel 
rate gone ascertained nothing done man trampled side channel crossed canoe object returning quietly camp rest 
yet quiet found captain robertson think refreshing bottle great state excitement native killed near favorite another whose leg broken 
declared vehemently hippopotamus done wounded rushed bushes hundred yards away meant take vengeance upon 
indeed setting 
seeing agitated state thought wisest follow 
happened need set detail 
sufficient say found hippopotamus blazed barrels bushes hitting seriously 
lumbered creature mouth open wishing escape 
robertson turned fly path one cause another tripped fell 
certainly would crushed beneath huge feet stepped front sent two solid eight bore bullets yawning throat killing dead within three feet robertson trying rise may add 
narrow escape sobered bound say gratitude profuse

asked voorlooper anything happened absence 
answered nothing previous evening dark seen glow direction strathmuir lay somewhat lower ground twenty miles away though numerous fires lighted 
struck much added climbed tree observe better 
think however building burned glow strong enough 
suggested caused grass fire reed burning replied indifferently think line glow sufficiently continuous 
matter ended though confess story made anxious exact reason could say 
umslopogaas also listened talk zulu looked grave made remark 
since tree climbing experience singularly silent thought little 
trekked time calculated would bring us strathmuir hour sundown allowing short halt half way 
oxen got quickly waggon outspan first away followed little distance umslopogaas preferred walk zulus 
truth could get story glow fires mind anxious push caused hurry inspanning 
perhaps covered couple miles ten twelve still lay us strathmuir far crest one waves veld much resembled swelling sea frozen motion saw small figure approaching us rapid trot 
somehow figure suggested hans mind much fetched glasses examine closely 
short scrutiny convinced hans hans advancing great pace 
filled uneasiness ordered driver flog oxen result little five minutes met 
halting waggon leapt waggon box calling umslopogaas kept us slow swinging trot went hans saw stood still little distance swinging apology hat hand fashion ashamed perplexed 
matter hans asked within speaking distance 
oh baas everything answered noticed kept eyes fixed upon ground lips twitched

counted bodies 
ill done killed six said umslopogaas moodily 
well left us finish fingered great axe 
captain robertson arrived waggon calling anxiously know matter premonition evil seemed struck 
heart sank sight tell story father murdered children abducted girl end felt could 
yes turned coward saying must fetch something waggon bolted bidding hans go forward repeat tale 
obeyed unwillingly enough looking curtains waggon tent saw happened though could hear words passed 
robertson halted oxen jumping waggon box strode forward met hans began speak twitching hat hands 
gradually tale progressed saw captain face freeze mask horror 
began argue deny weep oh terrible sight see great man weeping lost fashion 
kind blind rage seized thought going kill hans opinion ran away 
next staggered shaking fists cursing shouting till presently fell heap lay face downwards beating head ground groaning 
went sat 
pretty story quatermain little yellow monkey gibbering

minutes drugs began take effect upon robertson tortured nerves rose said quietly vengeance rather justice answered 
yes exclaimed vengeance 
swear avenged die 
saw opportunity said must swear robertson 
sober men accomplish great things drink destroys judgment 
wish avenged dead rescue living must sober one help

right said offhand fashion though inwardly glowed pride success great idea time thought great went let us get business 
first thing trek strathmuir make preparations next start upon trail 
come sit waggon tell guns ammunition got according hans savages seem touched anything except blankets herd goats 
asked telling could remember 
said strange thing recall two years ago great savage high nose talked sort arabic like inez understand lived coast turned one day said wanted trade

snatched big spear hand broke head gave best hiding shaft ever heard 
kicked place 
limped away reach turned called one day would come others take meaning inez without leaving price ivory gold 
ran gun got back gone never thought matter day 
well kept promise said robertson made answer time thundering dose bromide laudanum taken effect fallen asleep glad thought sleep would save sanity believe 
reached strathmuir towards sunset late think attempting pursuit day 
indeed trek thought matter carefully come conclusion try would useless 
must rest make preparations also hope overtaking brutes already clear twelve hours start sudden spurt 
must run patiently following spoor indeed could run vanished vast recesses unknown africa 
could night get ready 
captain robertson still sleeping passed village heartily glad since remains cannibal feast pleasant behold especially indeed determined rid slipping waggon hans farm boys none zulus would defile touching human remnants made two smouldering fires light voorlooper seen upon sky cast caused cast poor fragments 
also told farm natives dig big grave place bodies generally remove traces murder 
went house soon 
seeing waggons arrive made sure amahagger gone thomaso cowards emerged hiding places returned 
unfortunately former first person met umslopogaas began revile fat half breed measured terms calling dog coward opprobrious names deserter women children forth someone translated 
thomaso insolent person tried swagger matter saying gone get assistance 
infuriated lie umslopogaas leapt upon roar though strong man dealt lion buck 
lifting feet hurled ground strove rise run caught seemed break back across knee 
juncture arrived 
let man go shouted 
enough death already yes answered umslopogaas think 
best jackal live eat shame cast thomaso ground lay groaning 
robertson still asleep waggon woke noise descended looking dazed 
got house made way past rather bodies two zulus six men killed also inez shot 
zulus made splendid fight covered wounds front found upon examination 
made robertson lie upon bed took good look slain amahagger 
magnificent men tall spare shapely clear cut features rather frizzled hair 
characteristics well lightness color concluded semitic arab type admixture blood bantus slight indeed 
spears one cut blow zulu axe long broad unlike used masai finer workmanship 
time sun setting thoroughly tired gone went house get something eat told hans find food prepare meal 
sat robertson joined made also eat 
first impulse go cupboard fetch spirit bottle indeed rose 
hans making coffee said warningly 
thank answered forgot 
force habit know 
may state never moment see touch another drop liquor even drank modest tot front 
triumph temptation splendid complete especially absence accustomed potations made ill time course depressed spirits painful results apparent due course 
fact man became totally changed 
grew gloomy resourceful also full patience 
one idea obsessed rescue daughter avenge murder people indeed except sins thought found interest nothing else 
moreover iron constitution cast effects past debauchery grew strong although pretty tough days could tire 
return engaged conversation help made list require vendetta journey served occupy mind 
sent bed saying would call dawn first put little bromide third cup coffee 
turned notwithstanding sight remains cannibal feast knowledge dead men lay outside window slept like top 
indeed captain awakened captain saying daylight break better stirring 
went store thankful find everything tidied accordance directions 
way robertson asked become remains whereon pointed smouldering ashes one great fires 
went kneeling said prayer broad scotch doubtless one learned mother knee 
took ashes edge pyre threw glowing embers knew lay left sprung 
also tossed others air though meant understand never asked 
probably rite indicative expiation revenge learned savages among lived long 
went store help natives half breeds accompanied us sea cow expedition selected goods wanted sent house 
returned thither saw umslopogaas men engaged usual zulu ceremonies burying two companions hole made hillside 
noted however inter war axes throwing spears usual probably thought might needed 
place put dead little models roughly shaped bits wood models killed first breaking across 
lingered watch funeral heard goroko witch doctor make little speech 
father chief axe said addressing umslopogaas stood silent leaning weapon watching portentous figure morning mist father son heavens allusion royal blood umslopogaas secret well known although would never spoken aloud zululand slaughterer bulalio woodpecker picks hearts men king slayer conqueror halakazi victor hundred fights gatherer lily bloom faded hand wolf man captain wolves ravened slayer faku great one pleases seem small must follow blood end appointed opening speech bonga ing giving titles praise person addressed quoted sample many forgotten 
speaker went told though remember nothing spirit ago prophesied place would flow blood lo blood flowed brothers gave names two dead zulus also forefathers several generations 
seems father died well would wished die doubtless desired die leaving tale behind though true might died better killing men eaters certain would done sick inside 
finished gone beyond await us world among ghosts 
story told soon children names whispered honor sun set 
enough showed us die fathers 
goroko paused added waving hands spirit comes know brothers shall pass unavenged 
chief axe great glory awaits axe shall feed full 
spoken 
good words grunted umslopogaas 
saluted dead raising inkosikaas came consult journey 
chapter viii pursuit get away much noon first great deal done 
begin loads arranged 
consisted largely ammunition everything else cut irreducible minimum 
carry took two donkeys place also half dozen pack oxen animals supposed salted suffered recovered every kind sickness including bite deadly tsetse fly 
suspected true would proof attacks still hoped would last time indeed proved case 
event beasts failing us took also ten best strathmuir men accompanied us sea cow trip serve bearers became necessary 
said snuff butter fellows dash white blood veins exactly willing volunteers 
indeed choice left would think declined adventure 
choice 
master robertson ordered come glance zulus concluded command one would enforced stopped behind would living men 
also lost wives children slaughter brave filled desire revenge 
lastly could shoot fashion good rifles moreover may say think put confidence leadership 
made best bad business got ready 
arrangements must made carrying farm store absence 
together waggon oxen put charge thomaso since one else could trusted battered crestfallen thomaso way 
heard much relieved since think feared lest also expected take part hunt amahagger man eaters 
also may occurred probability none us would ever come back case process natural devolution might find owner business much valuable property 
however swore sundry saints thomaso nominally catholic would look everything though doubt hoped might become 
hearken fat pig said umslopogaas hans obligingly translating might mistake come back come back shall travel great medicine find even one cattle white lord macumazahn watcher night missing one article stolen waggon fields master cultivated goods wasted swear axe hew pieces axe yes hunt sun rises sets length night 
understand fat pig deserter women children save could run faster buck thomaso replied understood clearly indeed heaven helping kept safe sound 
still sure manly heart promising great gifts saints would arrange matters umslopogaas axe never seen strathmuir reflecting amahagger uses 
however trust least much left driver voorlooper guard belongings 
last get pursued fervent blessings thomaso prayers others would avenge murdered relatives 
curious motley procession 
first went hans following spoor believe almost unequalled africa umslopogaas three zulus guard surprise 
followed captain robertson seemed prefer walk alone thought best leave undisturbed 
came straggled strathmuir boys pack animals cavalcade closed remaining zulus command goroko 
walked last case mixed bloods attempt desert thought quite probable would 
less hour tramp brought us bush veld feared troubles might begin since amahagger cunning would take advantage confuse hide spoor 
chanced however done nothing sort child could followed march 
nightfall came first halting place made fire eaten one herd farm goats driven away although left cattle suppose goats docile travel well 
hans showed us everything happened chair inez carried set janee allowed walk might stretch stiff limbs dregs coffee evidently janee made saucepan forth 
even told us exact number amahagger said totalled forty one including man inez wounded 
spoor distinguished others occasional drop blood walked lightly right foot doubtless reason wished avoid jarring wound side 
spot obliged stay till daybreak since impossible follow spoor night circumstance gave cannibals great advantage us 
next two days repetitions first fourth passed bush veld swamp country bordered great river 
task still easy since amahagger followed one paths made river dwellers habitations mounds though whether natural artificial sure sometimes floating islands 
second day reeds came upon sad sight 
left stood one mound villages village could called since consisted four five huts inhabited perhaps twenty people 
went obtain information stumbled across body old man lying pathway 
yards found ashes big fire remains seen strathmuir 
another cannibal feast 
miserable huts empty strathmuir burnt 
going away acute ears hans caught sound groans 
searched clump reeds near foot mound found old woman great spear wound skinny thigh piercing deep vitals nature immediately mortal 
one robertson people understood language swamp dwellers well spoke 
told wanted water 
brought drank copiously 
answer questions began talk 
said amahagger attacked village killed could escape 
eaten young woman three children 
wounded spear fled away place found none took trouble follow worth eating 
direction man asked whether knew anything amahagger 
replied grandfathers though heard nothing since child must seventy years 
fierce people lived far north across great river remnants race ruled world 
grandfathers used say always cannibals become long lack food acquired taste 
purpose still raided get people eat since ruler would allow eat one another 
flesh cattle care although plenty sometimes ate goats pigs said tasted like man 
according grandfathers evil people full magic 
old woman told us quite briskly drunk water think wound mortified felt pain 
information however common aged dealt entirely far past history amahagger since days forebears knew nothing seen anything inez 
could tell us attacked village dawn ran hut speared 
robertson wondering poor old creature seemed cruel leave perish cleared question suddenly expiring eyes 
uttering name someone doubtless familiar youth three four times sank seemed go sleep examination found dead 
left went 
next day came edge great river sheet placid running water mile across time year low 
perceiving quite big village left went made enquiries find attacked cannibals probably powerful three nights canoes stolen doubt crossed river 
people village traded robertson strathmuir difficulty obtaining canoes cross zambesi return one oxen could see already sickening tsetse bite 
canoes large enough take donkeys patient creatures stood still cattle could get fear upset 
killed two driven beasts left us took us dead meat food three remaining pack oxen tried swim across dragging canoes hide reims round horns 
result two drowned one bold hearted enterprising animal gained bank 
struck sea reeds casting hans found spoor amahagger 
beyond doubt proved circumstance thorny kind weed found fragment cotton dress pattern stamped recognized one inez wearing 
first thought torn thorns examination became certain placed purposely probably janee give us clue 
conclusion confirmed subsequent periods hunt found fragments garment 
would useless set details prolonged arduous chase endured something three weeks 
lost trail able recover long elaborate search occupied much time 
escaped reeds swamps found upon stony uplands spoor almost impossible follow indeed rediscovered stumbling across dead body cannibal inez wounded 
evidently perished hurt could see mortified 
state remains gathered raiders must two days march ahead us 
striking spoor softer ground impress feet remained rate cunning sight hans followed across great valleys wherein trees grew sparsely valleys separated ridges high barren land 
belts rocky soil difficulties great twice put right track fragments torn dress inez 
length lost spoor altogether sign found 
idea way go 
us appeared valleys covered scattered bush running way could tell follow cross 
thing seemed hopeless could expect find little body men immensity hans shook head even fierce steadfast robertson discouraged 
fear poor lassie gone said relapsed brooding become wont 
never say die dogged replied cheerfully words nelson also learned meant hunt enemy trackless wastes although water 
walked top rise encamped sat alone think matters 
condition somewhat parlous beasts dead even second donkey last perished morning eaten food scanty since late met little game 
strathmuir men must carry loads almost worn doubtless would deserted except fact place could go 
even zulus discouraged said come away home across great river fight run wildernesses starve though umslopogaas made complaint buoyed promise soothsayer goroko battle ahead would win great glory 
hans however remained cheerful reason remarked vacuously great medicine us therefore however bad things seemed fact well argument carried conviction soul 
certain evening towards sunset went away thus alone 
looked east west north 
everywhere appeared bush clad valleys barren rises miles upon miles 
bethought map old zikali drawn ashes remembered showed valleys rises beyond great swamp beyond swamp mountain 
seemed right road home white queen person existed rate passing country similar pictured imagined 
time troubling head white queens 
thinking poor inez 
alive days knew fragments dress 
spoor utterly lost stony ground traces remained heavy deluge rain washed away 
even hans confessed beaten 
stared helplessly flying ray light setting sun reflected downwards storm cloud fell upon white patch crest one distant land waves 
struck probably limestone outcropped spot indeed proved case also patch white would convenient guide traveling across sea bush 
instinct within seemed impel steer although made mind go totally different direction many points east 
almost though voice calling take path 
doubtless effect produced weariness mental overstrain 
still real tangible one attempt combat 
next morning dawn headed north west laying course white patch first time breaking straight line advance 
captain robertson whose temper bettered prolonged frightful anxiety may add unaccustomed abstinence asked rather roughly altering course 
look captain answered sea something sort put question chance expect answer 
well wish command think argument holds 
yes replied 
suppose studied chart god forsaken country rate discipline discipline 
steam ahead mind 
others accepted decision without comment miserable care way went also good enough repose confidence judgment 
doubtless baas reasons said hans dubiously although spoor last saw headed towards rising sun country see man eaters returned 
yes said reasons although fact none 
hans surveyed watery eye though waiting explain looked haughty declined oblige 
baas reasons continued hans taking us think wrong side great ridge hunt spoor men eaters deep mind dig poor old hans look 
well baas wears great medicine perhaps reasons sit 
strathmuir fellows say go wish die 
umslopogaas gone axe tell ready help wish 
look got coming quickly prefer live 
well started white patch stones one else noticed said nothing anyone reached following evening find expected lime outcrop 
poor way practically nothing left eat tend raise spirits party 
also lime outcrop proved uninteresting spot overlooking wide valley seemed suggest valleys similar sort beyond nothing 
captain robertson sat stern faced despondent distance muttering beard become habit 
umslopogaas leaned upon axe contemplated heavens also occasionally strathmuir men cowered beneath eye 
zulus squatted sharing snuff remained economic pinches 
goroko witch doctor engaged consulting spirit means bone throwing upon humble subject whether succeed killing game food morrow point gathered spirit quite uncertain 
short gloom deep universal sky looked though going rain 
hans became sarcastic 
sneaking aggravating way like dog means steal something cover theft simulated affection pointed one one disadvantages present position 
indicated per contra advice followed conviction even found man eaters rescued lady called sad eyes state would quite different 
sure added valley suggested follow one full game inasmuch seen spoor entrance 
say asked 
hans sucked empty corn cob pipe way indicating would like give tobacco much dog groans heavily table wants bit eat answered point things one knew everything like great macumazahn watcher night honored master 
still luck seem gone bit wrong 
privations could put sucked loudly empty pipe looked mine alight everything could put chance coming even men eaters rescuing lady sad eyes whose face haunted sleep 
however convinced following course mapped lost spoor finally probably three days march away another direction 
still baas said reasons course enough hans baas would condescend tell would matter curiosity like know reasons 
moment confess much attached liked murder hans felt believing toast use vulgar phrase taking advantage position make mock sly hottentot way 
tried continue look grand felt attitude impress 
stared though taking counsel heavens devoutly hoping heavens would respond mute appeal 
matter fact 
reason hans said icy voice pointed faint line smoke rising twilight sky side intervening valley 
perceive hans added amahagger cannibals forgotten caution lit fire yonder done long time 
perhaps would like know happened 
tell 
days past purposely lost spoor knew following lit fires puzzle

even admiration contrived convey insult native 
wonderful great medicine opener roads able thus instruct baas said 
without doubt great medicine right yonder men eaters encamped might well anywhere else within hundred miles 
drat great medicine replied beneath breath added aloud good hans go umslopogaas tell macumazahn great medicine proposes march attack camp amahagger tobacco 
yes baas answered hans humbly snatched tobacco wriggled away like worm 
went talk robertson 
end within hour creeping across valley towards spot seen line smoke rising twilight sky 
somewhere midnight reached neighborhood place 
near far could tell since moon invisible course smoke dark 
question obviously would enormous advantages night attack least locating enemy might carried dawn marched 
especially since scarcely condition even could come face face fight savages prepared light day 
two white men hans umslopogaas zulus could relied upon case since strathmuir mixed bloods become entirely demoralised trusted pinch 
indeed tired half starving none us best 
therefore surprise seemed chance 
first must find wished surprise 
ultimately hurried consultation agreed hans go forward see could locate amahagger 
robertson wished come pointed must remain look people left might take opportunity melt away darkness especially knew heavy fighting hand 
also anything happened desirable one white man remain lead party 
umslopogaas volunteered knowing character declined help 
tell truth almost certain came upon men eaters would charge whole lot accomplish fine futile end hacking number cannibal barbarians whose extinction escape remained absolutely immaterial purpose namely rescue inez 
came hans started alone enjoying job 
suppose lurks nature primeval terror dark must continually haunted remote forefathers hundred thousand generations gone still lingers blood us 
rate even named watcher night greatly prefer fight face peril sunlight though true would rather avoid time 
fact wished heartily amahagger side africa heaven completely ignorant person called inez robertson seated smoking pipe peace stoep durban 
think hans guessed state mind since suggested go alone adding usual unveiled rudeness quite certain would much better without since white men always made noise 
yes replied determined give roland oliver doubt would first bush came across would sleep till dawn return say could find amahagger 
hans chuckled quite appreciating joke thus mutually affronted started quest 
chapter ix swamp neither hans carried rifles knew would way business scout 
moreover one always tempted shoot gun hand want present 
although revolver case urgent necessity weapon zulu axe formerly belonged one two men died defending inez veranda strathmuir hans nothing long knife 
thus armed unarmed crept forward towards spot whence conjectured seen line smoke rising hours 
quarter mile went thus without seeing hearing anything difficult job gloom among scattered trees light save stars gave us 
indeed suggest better abandon enterprise daybreak hans nudged whispering look right twin thorns 
obeyed following line sight indicated perceived distance two hundred yards faint glow faint indeed think hans would noticed 
really might nothing phosphorescence rising heap fungus even decaying animal 
fire saw smoke burnt ashes whispered hans 
think gone let us look 
crawled forward cautiously avoid making slightest noise cautiously indeed must taken us nearly half hour cover two hundred yards 
length within forty yards dying fire afraid go came stand rather lie still behind bushes knew 
hans lifted head sniffed broad nostrils whispered ear low could scarcely hear 
amahagger right baas smell 
course possible since wind blew direction fire although whose nose fairly keen could smell nothing 
determined wait watch indicated decision hans considering purpose accomplished showed signs wishing retreat 
minutes lay thus till sudden happened 
branch resinous wood stem eaten flames fell upon ashes fire burnt brilliant light 
saw amahagger sleeping circle round fire wrapped blankets 
also saw another thing namely nearer us dozen yards away indeed kind little tent also made fur rugs blankets doubtless sheltered inez 
indeed evident fact mouth wrapped something lay none maid janee face towards us recognized us flare flaming branch 
one thing noted namely two cannibals evidently guard sleeping us little tent 
course ought awake fatigue overcome slumbered seated ground heads hanging forward almost upon knees 
idea came 
could kill men without waking others gloom might possible rescue inez 
rapidly weighed pros cons attempt 
advantages successful object pursuit would carried without trouble doubtful whether ever get chance 
returned fetch others attacked force probability amahagger one would hear sound made advance number men fly darkness rather lose inez might kill 
stood fought might slain scrimmage 
dozen effectives strathmuir bearers could relied upon might defeat kill us outnumbered two three one 
arguments attempt 
making equally obvious 
begin one extraordinary risk two guards someone else behind might wake people like dogs mostly sleep one eye open especially knew pursued 
might bungle business raised outcry grew silent ever case us perhaps inez also would probably pay penalty could get away 
horned dilemma upon one point ran risk impaled 
full minute considered matter earnestness almost amounting mental agony last came conclusion danger enormous 
would better notwithstanding many disadvantages plan go back fetch others 
made one many mistakes life 
us foolish things wise ones sometimes think spite certain reputation caution far sightedness exceptionally cursed respect 
indeed look back upon past scarcely see scanty flowers wisdom decorate path fat ugly trees error overshadowed 
occasion forgetting past experiences hans concerned natural tendency blunder took form relying upon another judgment instead 
although formed certain view done pros cons seemed evenly balanced determined consult little hottentot accept verdict 
form gambling like pitch toss since although true hans clever rate cunning man according lights experienced meant placing judgment abeyance one considering life death enterprise taking chance another whatever might 
however first time grief 
tiniest whispers lips right smelly head submitted problem hans asking go go back 
considered answered voice contrived make like drone night beetle 
men fast asleep know breathing 
also baas great medicine 
therefore say go kill rescue sad eyes 
saw fates appealed decided must accept decree 
sick sinking heart like business wondered moment led hans take view directly opposite expected 
course superstition great medicine something felt convinced 
even guessed two arguments appealed first desired possible put end intolerable unceasing hunt worn us matter end might 
second powerful however believed rightly idea stealthy midnight blow appealed irresistibly craft half wild nature strains leopard snake seemed mingle human 
remembered notwithstanding veneer civilisation hans savage whose forefathers countless ages preserved alive means attacks stratagems 
die cast infinitesimal whispers made arrangements simple 
amounted creep men us kill one opposite axe hans knife remembering must done single stroke wake kill us get inez shelter dressed undressed make darkness pretty sure able baffle pursuit reached camp 
provided could kill two guards proper fashion rather large proviso admit thing simple shelling peas notwithstanding proverb experience simple since generally shells crack wrong way least one peas remained pod 
happened case janee forgotten remained pod 
sure know overlooked indeed error inexcusable especially hans already experienced foolishness lying eyes 
suppose minds concentrated upon guard killing tragic impressive inez room stolid matter fact janee 
rate proved pea would come pod 
often life felt terrified nature one rejoices dangers wild adventures sake stupid contrary forced undertake pressure circumstances kind hydraulic force one resist undertaken carried triumphing shrinkings flesh secret reserve nerve power 
almost tempted call spirit power something lives beyond yet inspires frail fallible bodies 
well rarely frightened moment 
actually hung back saw hans slithering grass like thick yellow snake great knife right hand quite foot ahead 
pride came rescue spurted one spurt upon one stomach drew level 
went pace slow able bodied snail would left us standing still 
inch inch crept forward lying motionless convulsive movement quite long time since left hand cannibal seemed wake opened mouth yawned 
changed mind rolling sitting posture side went sleep much soundly 
minute later right hand ruffian man also stirred sharply thought heard something 
apparently however haunted dreams resulting evil life perhaps prescience end waving arm muttering something frightened voice wearied poor devil sank back sleep 
last paused could see exactly strike knew us first blow must last fatal 
cloud come dimmed light must wait pass 
long wait seemed 
length cloud pass faint outline saw classical head amahagger bowed deep sleep 
heart beating fierce extremities love war hissed like snake agreed signal 
rising knees lifted zulu axe struck strength 
blow straight true umslopogaas could dealt better 
victim front uttered sound made movement sank gently side lay dead though never born 
appeared hans done equally well since man kicked long legs struck knees 
also became strangely still 
short stone dead would tell stories side judgment day 
recovering axe wrenched hand crept forward opened curtain like rugs blankets know covered inez 
heard stir 
movement wakened since captives sleep lightly 
make noise inez whispered 
allan quatermain come rescue 
slip follow understand yes quite whispered back began rise 
moment blood curdling yell seemed fill earth heaven yell memory even feel faint although writing years echoes died away 
may well say came janee awaking suddenly perceived background sky hans standing looking like yellow devil long knife hand thought used murder 
lacking self restraint screamed lusty fashion lungs excellent game 
instantly every man sleeping round fire leapt feet rushed direction echoes janee yell 
impossible get inez free tent arrangement anything except whisper feign sleep know nothing 
follow 
father us 
bolted back bushes hans reached already 
minute two later clear hubbub nearing camp hans remarked sententiously great medicine worked well baas quite well enough medicine avail woman folly folly blame answered 
ought known fool girl would shriek taken precautions 
yes baas ought killed nothing else would kept quiet replied hans cheerful assent 
shall pay mistake hunt must go 
moment stumbled across robertson umslopogaas others every living thing within mile two also heard janee yell briefly told story 
learned near rescuing daughter robertson groaned umslopogaas said well two less men eaters left deal 
still wisdom failed macumazahn 
found camp returned might attack together 
done dawn would one left 
yes answered think wisdom fail fail 
come perhaps may catch yet 
advanced hans showing road 
reached place late remained amahagger inez janee two dead men killed darkness pursuit impossible 
went back camp rest await dawn taking trail find confronted new trouble 
strathmuir half breeds left behind useless taken advantage absence zulus desert 
bolted back upon tracks vanished sea bush 
became know never saw belief cowardly fellows perished certainly one reached strathmuir 
fortunately us however departed hurry left loads behind even guns carried 
evidently janee yell last straw broke back nerve remained 
doubtless believed signal attack hordes cannibals 
nothing said done since pursuit curs question made best things 
proved simple business 
loads selected articles essential ammunition part carry rest abandoned hiding pile stones case ever come way 
guns thrown aside distributed among zulus none though thought possessed far concerned added another terror life 
prospect going battle wild axemen letting bullets every direction pleasant fortunately crisis came cast away reverted weapons accustomed 
sounds much like tale disaster rate failure 
however wonderful strange ways good results brought much times think seeming accidents must arranged intelligence superior fulfil us purposes know nothing frequently admitted nature sufficiently obscure 
course fatalistic doctrine said within certain limits fatalist 
take present case instance whole inez episode first sight might appear excrescence narrative object describe met certain wonderful woman heard experienced company 
yet really since inez adventure quite clear never reached home woman woman seen 
long became obvious shall told 
night upon hans failed rescue inez difficulty following trail cannibals thenceforward never hours ahead us time careful attempt hide spoor 
yet fast travel would burdened wearied proved impossible overtake 
first three days track ran scattered rolling bush veld character described tending continually hill 
broke camp morning fourth day eating hasty meal dawn game become astonishingly plentiful lack food rising sun showed beneath us endless sea billowy mist stretching every direction far sight could carry 
north however come end judged fifty sixty miles away rose grim outline looked like huge fortress knew must one extraordinary mountain formations probably owing origin volcanic action met vast expanses central eastern africa 
distant impossible estimate size guessed must enormous looking bethought great mountain zikali said marvellous white queen lived wondered whether could memory map upon ashes well might place existed 
map shown surrounded swamps well surely mist hid face mighty swamp indeed since nightfall following spoor amahagger plunged morass vast experience never seen heard like 
veritable ocean papyrus reeds dozen feet high impossible see yard direction 
amahagger ahead us proved salvation since without guide us must soon perished 
gigantic swamp ran road think ancient road since one two places saw stone work must laid man 
yet road would possible follow without guide seeing also overgrown reeds 
indeed difference surrounding swamp road soil comparatively firm say one seldom sank knee whereas either side quagmires often apparently bottomless partook nature quicksand 
found soon entered swamp since robertson pushing forward fierce eagerness seemed consume neglected keep eye upon spoor stepped edge land appeared exactly similar surface 
instantly began sink greasy tenacious mud 
umslopogaas twenty yards behind yet time reached answer shouts already engulfed middle going rapidly another minute would vanished altogether 
well got ease mud clung like tentacles octopus 
careful 
road run straight contrary curved sometimes turned right angles doubtless avoid piece swamp proved impossible ancients construct causeway follow crop harder soil beneath 
difficulties horrible place beyond description indeed scarcely imagined 
first kind grass grew among roots reeds edges like knives 
robertson wore gaiters suffer much poor zulus bare legs terribly cut cases lame 
mosquitoes lived million seemed anxious bite also snakes peculiarly deadly kind numerous 
zulu bitten one poisonous nature died within three minutes venom seemed go straight heart 
threw body swamp vanished 
lastly pervading stench intolerable heat place since breath air could penetrate forest reeds minor trouble multitude leeches fastened bodies 
looking one could see creatures sitting side leaves heads stretched waiting attack anything went 
wayfarers could numerous wondered lived last thousand years 
way found paraffin small supply hand lamps rubbed exposed surfaces extent protection blood sucking worms gnats although make one go smelling like dirty oil tin 
day except occasional rush great iguana reptile sound wings flocks wildfowl passing us time time march deathly silent 
night different bull frogs boomed incessantly bitterns great swamp owls night flying birds uttered weird cries 
also mysterious sucking noises caused doubt sinking areas swamp bursting bubbles foul rushing gas 
strange lights played wisps st elmo fires believe called frightened zulus much since believed spirits dead 
perhaps superstition something native legend mankind torn reeds 
may imagined ghosts men went back reeds enough accommodate entire zulu nation 
way much scared even bold witch doctor goroko scared went incantations little bag medicines carried secure protection companions 
indeed think even iron umslopogaas comfortable might although inform come fight care whether man wizard spirit

bottom business delivered hands zikali opener roads sure merely making use private occult purposes

jb well business must follow finish whatever might 
interesting anything zikali said could conceive object sending wild goose chase home geese ducks might become interesting still 
pretty well fever proof think die morass course nine white men ten would done beyond lay huge mountain day day grew larger clearer 
hans childlike trust pinned faith great medicine 
remarked worst veld ever traveled great medicine would never consent buried stinking mud doubt come safely time 
replied wonderful medicine saved one companions made grave mud 
baas said zulus nothing medicine given accompanied saw opener roads 
therefore perhaps die except umslopogaas told take 
matter since plenty zulus although one macumazahn one hans also baas may remember began offending snake therefore quite natural snake brother bitten zulu 
right bitten hans 
yes baas doubt would done protected great medicine grandfather snake charmer say nothing smell medicine well 
snakes know bite baas 
mosquitoes answered grabbing handful 
great medicine effect upon 
oh yes baas since though pleases bite bites us harm least much made happy 
still wish could get reeds never want see another baas please keep rifle ready think hear crocodile stirring 
need hans remarked sarcastically 
go tell great medicine 
yes baas also hungry zulus camped yards road went solemnly reeds little way began talk 
infernal donkey murmured drew blanket head vain attempt keep mosquitoes smoking furiously object tried get sleep 
last swamp bottom began slope upwards little result land dried natural drainage reeds grew thinner degrees finally ceased found firmer ground indeed upon lowest slopes great mountain mentioned towered us forbidden majestic 
made little map pocket book various twists turns road vast slough despond marking hour hour followed devious wanderings 
studying end part journey realized afresh utterly impossible would us thread misty maze false steps would always meant death suffocation spoor amahagger traveling immediately ahead us acquainted secrets 
friendly guides could done us better turn 
wondered tried ambush us reeds since fires must shown close upon heels 
try burn us clear certain evidences found fortunately season year absence strong wind rank reeds green catch fire 
rest soon learn reason neglect attack us dense cover 
waiting better opportunity chapter x attack reeds last fervently thanked god since crossed endless marsh unguided loss one man seemed little less miraculous 
emerged late afternoon wearied stopped rest eat flesh buck fortunate enough shoot upon fringe 
pushed forward slope proposing camp night crest mile away thought escape deadly mist enveloped long obtain clear view country ahead 
following bank stream ran marsh came length crest sun sinking 
us lay deep valley fold skin mountain well densely bushed 
woods valley climbed mountain flank distance gave way grassy slopes ended steep sides rock crowned black frowning precipice unknown height 
remember something impressive towering natural wall seemed shut whatever lay beyond gaze man though veiled ancient mystery 
indeed aspect thrilled knew 
observed however one point mighty cliff seemed narrow cleft doubt lava flowed remote age occurred cleft ran roadway probably continuation threaded swamp 
fact glasses could see herds cattle grazing slopes mountain went confirm view since cattle imply owners herdsmen search would could find native villages slopes 
inference seemed owners dwelt beyond within mountain 
things saw pointed robertson light setting sun 
meanwhile umslopogaas engaged selecting spot camp night 
soldierlike instinct perchance prescience danger caused choose place particularly suitable defense 
steep sided mound less resembled gigantic ant heap 
upon one side mound protected stream pool rather deep back stood collection curious piled water worn rocks often found africa 
rocks lying one upon another like stones cyclopean wall curved round western side mound practically open narrow space say thirty forty feet upon face looked mountain 
umslopogaas expects battle remarked hans grin otherwise nice plain round us would chosen camp place men could hold many 
yes baas thinks cannibals going attack us 
stranger things happened answered indifferently seen rifles went lie observing tired zulus seemed already asleep 
umslopogaas sleep 
contrary stood leaning axe staring dim outlines opposing precipice 
strange mountain macumazahn said compared witch beneath kraal lies little baby 
wonder shall find within 
always loved mountains macumazahn ever since dead brother mine lived wolves witch lap best fighting 
perhaps done yet answered wearily 
hope macumazahn since due us days mud stench 
sleep macumazahn head use much must need rest 
fear little yellow man think much keep watch wake need mayhap dawn 
none come us except front place narrow 
lay slept soundly ever done life space four five hours suppose 
instinct perhaps awoke suddenly feeling much refreshed sweet mountain air new man indeed moonlight saw umslopogaas striding towards 
arise macumazahn said hear men stirring us 
moment hans slipped past whispering cannibals coming baas good number 
think mean attack dawn 
passed behind warn zulus 
went said hans time great medicine show 
great medicine look right baas replied pausing speaking dutch umslopogaas understand expect fewer zulus cook sun grows hot 
spirits turned snakes go back reeds say torn added shoulder 
explain hans acted cook party grievance zulus ate much meat called upon prepare 
indeed never much sympathy hottentots zulus 
little yellow man saying us asked umslopogaas suspiciously 
saying comes battle men make great fight replied diplomatically 
yes macumazahn thought said killed pleased 
oh dear answered hastily 
could pleased happened since would left defenceless killed 
umslopogaas let us make plan fight 
together robertson rapidly discussed thing 
result help zulus dragged together loose stones tops three small thorn trees cut made low breastwork sufficient give us protection lay shoot 
work minutes since prepared material camped case emergency arise 
behind breastwork gathered waited robertson careful get little rear zulus remembered rifles strathmuir bastards left behind bolted addition axes throwing assegais 
question cannibals would fight 
knew armed long spears knives know used spears thrusting throwing 
former case would difficult get axes must longer reach 
fortunately turned 
length ready came long trying wait disagreeable part fight one grows nervous begins reflect earnestly upon one sins 
clearly amahagger really intended business mean attack till dawn common native fashion thinking rush us low puzzling light 
perplexed wish attack us let many opportunities go 
apparently men sight home doubt many friends pushing could reach shelter us especially knew roads 
come secret purpose seemed abduction certain young white woman reasons connected tribal statecraft ritual kind thing happens infrequently among obscure ancient african tribes 
well abducted young woman sight safety success objects whatever might 
possible reason could desire risk fight outraged friends relatives young woman true outnumbered us therefore good chance victory hand must know would dearly retake captive trouble would nothing 
must exhausted travel worn condition face desperate battle 
problem beyond gave reflection either threatened attack mere feint delay us behind something mysterious determination prevent us hazards discovering secrets mountain stronghold 
put riddle hans lying next ready another solution 
men eaters baas said hungry wish eat us get land doubtless allowed eat 
think answered thin surveyed hans scraggy form moonlight 
oh yes baas quite good boiled like old hens baas 
also nature cannibals prefer thin man fat beef 
devil gives taste baas makes like gin turn head look pretty women zulus say always country especially certain witch named mameena kissed everybody turned head look hans proposing smite words physically since mameena myth detailed origin book called child storm arise hideous little mouth much 
could get syllable held finger whispered hush dawn breaks come 
hear 
listened intently could distinguish nothing 
straining eyes presently thought hundred yards slope beneath us dim light caught sight ghostlike figures flitting tree tree also figures drawing nearer 
look said robertson right believe coming 
man answered sternly hope else wanted meet days figures vanished little fold ground 
minute later appeared upon hither side light fading stars gathering dawn fell full upon trees 
looked thrill horror went one glance recognized men following 
begin many quite hundred think also painted shields wore feathers hair generally far could judge seemed fat fresh 
led ambush said first zulu umslopogaas immediately front english robertson 
man must best answered latter god help poor daughter devils taken away leaving brethren make end us 
macumazahn broke umslopogaas 
well whatever end shall better fight 
give word obey 
savages call although admit cannibals looked like high class arabs savages came perfect silence hoping suppose catch us asleep 
fifty yards away running treble line spears advanced called fire zulu set example loosing barrels express rifle men picked leaders results must satisfactory two amahagger whose troubles world came end 
followed tremendous fusillade zulus banging guns wildly even distance managing part shoot enemy heads 
captain robertson hans however better general result amahagger appeared unaccustomed firearms retreated hurry fold ground whence emerged 
last got loaded two stopped behind 
altogether put nine ten action 
hoped would give business 
brave fellows pause perhaps five minutes charged body hoping overwhelm us 
greeted bullets knocked several whereon rest threw volley long spears us 
glad see although one zulus got death two wounded 
narrow escape spear passed neck shoulder 
carried one weapons knew used throwing big knives would remain attack us 
discharge spears kept time rushed us followed great fight 
zulus throwing guns rose feet holding little fighting shields carried mats left hand wielded axes right 
umslopogaas stood center however shield swung great axe arms 
first time seen fight spectacle way magnificent 
axe crashed every time fell left one dead beneath stroke till length amahagger shrank back reach 
meanwhile robertson hans standing stones back kept continual fire upon shooting heads zulus playing part like men 
yes shrank back leaving many dead behind 
captain tried gather another rush moved forward 
killed captain revolver shot rifle become hot hold sight fall broke ran back little hollow bullets could reach 
far held price three zulus dead three wounded one severely two enough cripple 
fact left three untouched men umslopogaas fighting purposes seven 
availed killed great number amahagger seven could seven men withstand another onslaught pale light dawn looked dismayed 
said umslopogaas leaning red axe remains one thing make good end though would greater cause 
least must either fight fly looked wounded 
think us father murmured one man mortal hurt 
best kill us begone may live bear axe years come 
well spoken said umslopogaas stood still added word macumazahn captain 
set situation robertson hans briefly could showing chance life ran far could see none stayed 
go like quatermain answered captain shall stop die since girl gone think better dead 
motioned hans speak 
baas answered great medicine us upon earth reverend father predikant us sky think better stop especially want see reeds present 
said briefly giving reasons 
made ready next attack knew would last strengthening little wall dragging dead amahagger added protection 
thus engaged sun rose first beams miles away opposing slopes mountain looking tiny black background precipice saw party men creeping forward 
lifting glasses studied perceived midst litter 
goes daughter said handed glasses robertson 
oh god answered villains outwitted us 
another minute litter rather chair escort vanished shadow great cliffs probably pass could see 
next moment thoughts otherwise engaged since various symptoms gathered attack renewed 
spears upon shone light rising sun appeared edge ground fold mentioned east increased deep bush clad ravine 
also voices leaders encouraging men desperate effort 
coming said robertson 
yes answered coming going 
queer end thing call life quatermain hang wonder beyond much expect whatever could scarcely worse gone one way another 
hope us replied cheerfully could man deep depression disturbed 
mayhap quatermain knows infinite mercy whatever made us old mother used preach remember words 
case expect stop hope sleep inez mind much tell enough world life 
look one 
take black devil lifting rifle aimed fired amahagger appeared upon edge fold ground 
hit saw man double fall backwards 
game began afresh cannibals suppose cannibals like brethren crept shelter advancing stomachs hands knees offer smaller mark dragging long slender tree trunk clearly intended batter wall 
course blazed away pretty carefully determined believed last exercise gift shooting given prove record 
therefore selected men even would hit subsequent examination showed made mistakes seven eight shots fired 
like poor captain robertson thinking things namely bound presently meet certain folk meaning show called life unless leads somewhere according judgment none 
questions solved however duty kill many ruffians could finish despatch 
robertson hans firing also less success many stopped three rifles 
still came till length fierce faces within yards little parapet umslopogaas lifted great axe give greeting 
paused moment making final rush slip fresh cartridges 
die well hans said get first wait side 
yes baas always meant though yet 
going die time baas 
great medicine die others die like fellow pointed amahagger went reeling round round bullet winchester middle fired midst remarks 
curse mean bless great medicine said lifted rifle shoulder 
moment amahagger sixty left became seized certain perturbation 
stood still stared towards fold ground emerged called words catch turned run 
umslopogaas saw leader instinct acted 
springing parapet followed remaining zulus axe leapt upon roar 
went inkosikaas like corn sickle 
thing marvellous see like charge leopard swift rush lightning like strokes rather pecks flashing axe tapping heads spines gouge like point upon back 
victims brave followers also part 
minute remained upon feet amahagger full flight vanishing way among trees 
hans fired parting shot last sat upon stone finding corn cob pipe proceeded fill 
great medicine baas began sententiously perhaps reverend father predikant paused pointed doubtfully bowl pipe towards fold ground adding think must reverend father great medicine yes predikant returned heaven place fires looking vaguely direction indicated could conceive meant thought excitement must made mad perceived venerable old man long white beard clothed flowing garment also white reminded father christmas child party walking towards us radiating benignancy 
also behind perceived whole forest spear points emerging gully 
seemed take granted shoot came quite unconcerned carefully picking way among corpses 
near enough stopped said kind arabic could understand greet strangers name serve 
see time surprise since said would 
seem done well dogs prodded dead amahagger sandalled foot 
yes well indeed 
must great warriors 
paused stared 
chapter xi mountain wall seem friends said pointing fallen 
yet added nodding towards spearmen emerging gully like friends 
puppies litter often alike yet grow sometimes fight replied father christmas blandly 
least come save kill 
look kill others pointed making end wounded men 
glanced evident astonishment first fearsome looking umslopogaas grotesque hans 
nay answer must weary need rest 
afterwards talk 
well matter fact yet breakfasted replied 
also business attend glanced wounded 
old fellow nodded went speak captains force doubtless pursuit enemy presently saw company spring forward tracks 
assisted hans remaining zulus one goroko turned attend people 
task proved lighter expected since badly injured man dead dying hurts two others legs comparatively slight goroko could doctor native fashion 
taking hans guard back went stream washed 
returned ate wondering could appetite terrible dangers passed 
still passed robertson umslopogaas three men hans quite unharmed fact returned thanks silence sincerely enough providence 
hans also returned thanks fashion filled lit corn cob pipe 
robertson made remark indeed satisfied natural cravings rose walking paces forward stood staring cleft mountain cliff seen litter vanish bore daughter fate unknown 
even great fight fought victory overpowering odds appear impress 
glared mountain heart inez raped away shook fist 
since gone else went nothing much offer assist wounded zulus show curiosity strange old man rescued 
great medicine baas said hans bewildered way even powerful thought 
brought us safely fighting without scratch zulus matter less cooking gone also brought reverend father predikant place fires heaven somewhat changed remember true still without doubt 
make report presently understand talk shall stop infernal nonsense son donkey broke moment old father christmas smiling benignly appeared kloof vanished advanced towards us bowing much politeness 
seated upon little wall built contemplated us stroking beautiful white beard said addressing certainty proud defeated many 
still ordered come speed think would looked towards dead zulus laid distance like men asleep companions sought place bury 
ordered asked 
one order answered mild astonishment 
commands everlasting occurred must arabic idiom eternal feminine looked vague said would appear exalted everlasting command attacked us also fled away yonder waved hand towards mountain 
command absolute every country rebels even heard heaven us 
wanderer name watcher night answered 
ah good name one must watched well night day reach country living commands says man color set foot many generations 
indeed think told two thousand years gone since spoke white man city k r indeed exclaimed stifling cough

good name judge wounds certain rebels think telling hell 
man indeed man added looking doubtfully hans 
light darkness name

white man mutters whose brow like storm called avenger learn later answered impatiently grew tired catechism adding called pleased tell us upon errand visit us fortunate hour named billali answered servant messenger commands sent save bring safely 
billali seeing none knew coming yet commands knew said benignant smile 
indeed think learned moons ago message sent arranged things guided safely secret home since otherwise would passed great pathless swamp loss think said one man snake bit stared old fellow could know death man thought useless pursue conversation 
rested ready went start 
meanwhile leave may prepare litters carry wounded men also watcher night wish 
dignified bow everything old fellow stately turned vanished kloof 
next hour occupied burial dead zulus ceremony took part beyond standing raising hat borne away said somewhere best leave natives alone occasions 
indeed lay reflecting strangely enough seemed something old zikali tale wonderful white queen lived mountain fastness since mountain drawn ashes servants queen apparently knowledge coming appeared nick time rescue us one tightest fixes ever found 
moreover antique courteous individual called billali spoke everlasting 
deuce could mean wondered probably old therefore disagreeable look confessed would disappointment 
know coming could guess asked robertson merely shrugged shoulders intimated took interest matter 
truth nothing moved man whose whole soul wrapped one desire namely rescue avenge daughter knew sorely sinned 
fact loose living reformed seaman becoming monomaniac one religious type 
bible given mother boy read constantly also always knees night could hear groaning praying aloud 
doubtless chains drink fallen instincts blood dour old covenanters descended asserting 
way good thing though time past feared lest end going mad certainly companion cheerful unregenerate days 
abandoning speculation useless taking chance murdered lay billali followers singularly like men fighting aught knew might animated identical objects went sleep time wake hour later feeling wonderfully refreshed 
hans closed eyes already asleep slumbering feet curled like dog spot sun struck hotly roused saying awake baas sprang snatching rifle thought meant attacked see billali advancing head train four litters made bamboo grass mats curtains coverings carried stalwart amahagger supposed must 
two finest billali indicated robertson two others wounded 
umslopogaas remaining zulus evidently expected walk hans 
make quickly asked surveying elegant indeed artistic workmanship 
make watcher night brought us folded 
commands looked glass said four would needed besides yonder two white lords two wounded black men see number required 
yes answered vaguely marvelling kind glass gave lady information 
could inquire upon point billali added glad learn men caught rebels dared attack eight ten hurt missiles axe cuts put death proper fashion yes quite proper fashion smiled little 
rest gone far would dangerous follow among rocks 
enter lord watcher night road steep must travel fast would reach place commands camped ancient holy city moon sinks behind cliffs night 
explained matters robertson umslopogaas announced nothing would induce carried like old woman corpse upon shield seen hurt zulus comfortably accommodated robertson got litters proved delightfully easy restful 
gear collected hook nosed bearers obliged trust though kept us rifles certain amount ammunition started 
first went number billali spearmen came litters wounded alongside umslopogaas three uninjured zulus talked trotted another litter containing billali ran hans robertson lastly rest amahagger relief bearers 
see baas said hans thrusting head curtains yonder whitebeard reverend father predikant 
asked though fact fairly obvious 
baas would left hans always thought well run sun like dog others travel carriages like great white ladies 
better save breath instead talking nonsense hans said since believe long way go 
fact proved long way indeed especially began breast mountain must travel slowly 
started ten clock morning fight take long remembered begun shortly dawn three afternoon reached base towering cliff mentioned 
foot remarkable isolated column rock destined see strange sight days halted ate remaining food brought us amahagger consumed seemed consist largely curdled milk zulus call maas lumps kind bread 
noted curious people fed silence whose handsome solemn faces one never saw smile 
somehow gave creeps look 
robertson affected way one rare intervals abstraction remarked canny 
added ask yon old wizard might one bible prophets come life man eating devils done daughter 
billali answered say taken away make queen since rebelled queen must another white 
say commands wage war perhaps win back unless kill first 
ah robertson repeated translated unless kill first worse 
relapsed usual silence 
presently started heading straight looked like sheer wall black rock thousand feet height path steep robertson got walked rather scrambled order ease bearers 
billali noticed remained litter 
convenience bearers trouble ordered extra gang poles 
could imagine negotiate precipice 
could umslopogaas looked said climb macumazahn think one live get top little yellow monkey pointed axe hans 
replied worthy much nettled hated called yellow monkey zulus sure roll stones upon black butcher see sprawling upon cliff 
umslopogaas smiled grimly sense humor could appreciate repartee even hit hard 
stopped talking climb took breath 
length came cliff face appearance journey must end 
suddenly however blind black wall front us started apparition tall man armed great spear wearing white robe challenged us hoarsely 
suddenly stood us ghost might though whence came could see 
presently mystery explained 
cliff face cleft though one invisible even paces away since outer edge projected inner wall rock 
moreover opening four feet width mere split huge mountain mass caused titanic convulsion past ages 
definite split since entered far far could traced faint line light coming sky although gloom passage torches stored hand must used threaded 
one man could held place hundred killed 
still guarded mouth warrior appeared along every turn jagged chasm many 
grim place went 
zulus like light loving people noted even umslopogaas seemed scared hung back little 
hans usual suspicion feared trap matter though thought well appear much interested 
robertson seemed quite indifferent trudged along stolidly man carrying torch 
old billali put head litter shouted back fear nothing since pitfalls path voice echoing strangely narrow walls measureless height 
half hour pursued dreary winding path round corners draught tore gusts fierce litters wounded men bore nearly blown 
safe enough however since either side us smooth without break rose sheer walls rock lay tiny ribbon blue sky 
length cleft widened somewhat light grew stronger making torches unnecessary 
sudden came end found upon little plateau mountainside 
behind us thousand feet rose sheer rock wall upon outer face front beneath far beneath beautiful plain circular shape great extent plain everywhere surrounded far could see wall rock 
short notwithstanding enormous size without doubt neither less crater vast extinct volcano

sunset great solemn place wonderful thing see 
first measureless crater filled light like bowl fire 
great orb sank behind western cliff half plain became quite dark shadows seemed rush forward eastern part surface till swallowed gloom little remained glow reflected cliff face sky crest parapet rock played strange glorious fires 
presently vanished world dark 
half moon broke behind bank clouds silver uncertain light struggled forward across flat plain rather slowly even iron muscles bearers grew tired

farewell 
chapter xv robertson lost went conducted billali old chamberlain seemed office waiting patiently without back rest house 
way picked hans found sitting outside arch found usual worthy keeping eyes ears open 
baas said white witch tell big impi encamped yonder outside houses looks like great dry ditch edge plain beyond hans said evening would show us whose company must fight 
well baas thousands crept broken walls like snake saw 
baas think men think evil spirits walk night 
hans sun high baas sleeping 
yes lie abed fast asleep people night sentries guard yawning rubbing eyes 
heard folk like middle africa sun hot hans answered perhaps commands going take us see night 
also people seems worshippers moon 
baas worshippers devil white witch wife 
better keep thoughts hans whatever think read thoughts far away guessed last night 
therefore would 
baas must think henceforth shall gin place also far away replied grinning 
came rest house found robertson already eaten midday meal like amahagger gone sleep apparently umslopogaas done least saw nothing 
glad since wondrous ayesha seemed draw vitality long talk felt tired 
ate went lie old wall shade little distance reflect upon marvellous things heard 
said believed nothing least little indeed 
involved tale ayesha long life dismissed incredible 
clearly beautiful woman less mad suffered megalomania probably arab wandered place reasons become chieftainess savage tribe whose traditions absorbed reproduced personal experiences reasons 
rest threatened another tribe knowing guns could fight happened yesterday wished naturally enough assistance coming battle 
marvellous chief rezu rather supernatural attributes cock bull story axe well humbug like rest believed must foolish took even unhinged certain points 
rest information umslopogaas doubtless reached zikali obscure fashion acknowledged 
heavens beautiful flash loveliness pique coquetry lifted veil blinded like lightning 
thank goodness also like lightning frightened instinctively one felt dangerous even death one wished closer acquaintance 
fire may lovely attractive also comforting proper distance sits top cremated many moth found 
argued knowing well enough particular human inhuman fire desired make holocaust could easily enough reality owed safety far lack desire part 
glorious ayesha saw nothing attract insignificant withered hunter rate exterior though mind might find small affinity 
moreover make fool fun would serve purpose since needed assistance business necessitated clear wits unprejudiced judgment 
lastly declared absorbed tiresome complication another man rather difficult follow details 
true described handsome somewhat empty headed person last seen two thousand years ago probably meant thought poorly preferred woman two thousand years added tale give atmosphere 
worst scandals becomes romantic even respectable two thousand years witness cleopatra c sar mark antony gentlemen 
virtuous read cleopatra sympathy even boarding schools felt miracle blotted book history loss would enormous 
applied helen phryne bad lots 
fact one comes think attractive personages history male female especially latter bad lots 
find someone whose name added good skip 
doubt ayesha clever appreciated regrettable truth therefore moved murky entanglements past decade back couple thousand years many us would like 
remained curious circumstance apparent correspondence old zikali lived far away 
however inexplicable 
course great deal experience observed witch doctor family doubtless belonged strange means communication 
instances doubt physical carried help messengers messages passed one 
sometimes reasonable assume known telepathy link intercourse 
two highly developed experts ayesha zikali might sake argument safely supposed thus learned mind co operated projects though perhaps end effected commoner methods 
whatever interpretations issue business seemed let fighting 
well case could avoided since robertson daughter inez saved costs could possibly done even lost lives attempt 
therefore fight must nothing said 
also without doubt adventure particularly interesting could hope good luck zikali great medicine rather providence would see safely 
rest fact help necessary war like venture showed clearly enough wonderful woman pretensions supernatural powers sheerest nonsense 
otherwise would needed help tribal fights notwithstanding rubbish talked chief rezu according account must resemble one fabulous trolls half human half ghostly evil creatures read norse sagas could slain particular hero armed particular weapon 
reflecting thus went sleep wake sun setting 
finding hans also sleeping feet like faithful dog woke went back together rest house reached darkness fell extraordinary swiftness latitudes especially place surrounded cliffs 
finding robertson house concluded somewhere outside possibly making reconnaissance account told hans get supper ready us 
aid amahagger lamps umslopogaas suddenly appeared circle light looking said red beard macumazahn answered know waited felt sure something say 
think better keep red beard close macumazahn went 
afternoon returned visiting white doctoress eaten gone sleep wall yonder saw red beard come house carrying gun bag cartridges 
eyes rolled wildly turned first way sniffing air like buck scents danger 
began talk aloud tongue saw speaking spirit mad went away left 
asked 
know macumazahn law among us zulus never disturb one mad engaged talking spirit 
moreover done probably would shot complained would thrust right 
come call umslopogaas might shot seen time inspired heaven knows upon earth thinking lady sad eyes stolen away natural 
left walking returned later look saw gone thought walled hut 
hansi tells come speak 
certainly said went look bed robertson slept see used evening 
first time saw lying piece paper torn pocketbook addressed 
seized read 
ran thus merciful lord sent vision inez shown cliff edge away west also road 
sleep heard talking 
told great danger going marry brute called come save yes come alone without saying anything anyone 
going 
frightened trouble 
well quite well 
tell rest meet 
horrorstruck translated insane screed umslopogaas hans 
former nodded gravely 
tell talking spirit macumazahn rendered merciful lord good spirit 
well gone doubtless spirit take care 
finished 
rate baas broke hans think feared might send look robertson 
follow spoors night one could cut blackness lumps build wall 
yes answered gone nothing done present though reflected probably gone far would found moon rose rate following morning 
still uneasy man noted long losing balance 
shock barbarous dreadful slaughter half breed children abduction inez grim man eating savages began business think increased accentuated sudden conversion complete temperance years heavy drinking 
persuaded course proud thinking done clever thing sure 
perhaps would better continued drink something rate trouble cases generally half way house 
man still woman given frailty either turns aggressively sober remains drunken 
rate even made mess acted best could blame 
rest clear new phase religious associations youth asserted remarkable vigor gathered brought almost calvinist rush return overset equilibrium 
said prayed night day without reserves people prefer religious exercises talked matters outside quest conversation generally revolved round devil hell torments say truth make cheerful companion 
indeed respect liked much better old unregenerate days fear somewhat worldly soul 
well sum poor fellow gone mad given us slip hans said search darkness impossible 
indeed even lighter think would safe among amahagger nightbirds trust 
certainly could asked hans undertake task think would gone since afraid amahagger 
therefore nothing done except wait hope best 
waited till last moon came ayesha promised 
clad rich dark cloak arrived pomp heralded billali followed women also cloaked surrounded guard tall spearmen 
seated outside house smoking suddenly arrived shadows stood 
rose respectfully bowed umslopogaas goroko zulus gave royal salute hans cringed like dog afraid kicked 
swift glance guessed motion veiled head seemed fix gaze upon pipe evidently excited curiosity asked 
explained well could expatiating charms smoking 
men learned another useless vice since left world one filthy also said sniffing smoke waving hand face whereon dropped pipe pocket alight burnt hole best remaining coat 
remember remark showed clever actress keep character antiquity pretended astonished habit must well acquainted although believe unknown ancient world 
troubled went swiftly changing subject read face 
one company missing 
ah see white man name avenger 
gone wish ask ayesha said 
tell allan place lack glass look things pass afar 
still let try pressing hands forehead remained silent perhaps minute spoke slowly 
think gone mountain lip towards worshippers rezu 
think mad sorrow something else understand turned brain something heavens 
think also shall recover living little though sure since given read future past sometimes things happen present though far away 
send search ayesha asked anxiously 
nay useless already distant 
moreover went might taken outposts rezu perchance happened companion wandering madness 
know went seek less answered translated letter robertson left 
may man writes commented since mad often see well dreams though sent god imagines 
mind secret places knows things allan although seems know little nothing breath vision fury soul distraught blows away veils burns gates distance sees learns since whatever fools may think often madness true wisdom 
follow little yellow man warrior axe 
stay let look upon axe 
interpreted wish umslopogaas held refused loose wrist attached leathern thong 
black one think shall cut weapon weak gentle asked laughing 
nay ayesha law part drinker lives names chieftainess groan maker clings closer day night man wife 
wise allan since savage captain may get wives never another axe 
thing ancient added musingly examining every detail knows may whereof legend tells fated bring rezu dust 
ask fierce eyed slayer whether armed axe find courage face terrible men strongest one wizard also prophesied axe made bite dust 
obeyed 
umslopogaas laughed grimly answered say white witch man living upon earth would face war never conquered fair fight though chance blow brought doors death touched great hole forehead 
say also fear defeat doom think still far away though opener roads told among strange people shall die war last desire boyhood lived war 
speaks well answered note admiration voice 
isis white would set rule amahagger 
tell allan lays rezu low shall great reward 
tell white witch macumazahn umslopogaas replied translated seek reward save glory sight one lost heart still dwells indeed witch strength break wall blackness built gone 
strange reflected ayesha understood grim destroyer yet bound silken bonds love yearn one grave taken 
learn allan humanity cast mould since longings longings also though three us far apart sun moon earth different every quality 
yet true sun moon earth born black womb chaos 
therefore beginning identical doubtless end journeyings done rush together light space flame mocking gods made may warm hands 
well men allan whose soul stuff drawn gulf spirit nature hand cast upon cold air death driven world freezes million shapes different yet sure 
talk follow 
slave addressed billali bid guards lead camp servants lulala 
went silent ruins 
ayesha walked rather glided pace two ahead came umslopogaas side side heels followed hans close heels since wish reach virtue great medicine incidentally protection axe rifle 
thus marched surrounded solemn guard something quarter half mile till length climbed debris mighty wall encompassed city moonlight saw beneath us vast hollow clearly unknown time bed enormous moat filled water 
however dry surface dotted numerous camp fires round men moving also women appeared engaged cooking food 
little distance upon edge moat like depression number white robed individuals gathered circle large stone upon something stretched resembled carcase sheep goat round great number spectators 
priests lulala make sacrifice moon night night save dead said ayesha turning back towards though answer query conceived left unuttered 
struck whole scene extraordinary animation briskness 
folk round fires outside moved quickly kind liveliness might animate camp natural people rising sun 
though got full vigor commence daily rather nightly round truth case since hans discovered habitude amahagger preferred sleep day unless something prevented carry activities life night 
remains add seemed great number fires following round dry moat stretched could see 
scrambling crumpled wall zig zag pathway came upon outposts army beneath us challenged seeing fell flat upon faces leaving great spears iron spikes shafts like masai sticking ground beside 
passed fires noted solemn gloomy although handsome countenances folk surrounded 
indeed looked like denizens different world one alien kindly race men 
nothing social amahagger seemed people laboring ancient ancestral curse could never shake memory 
even women rarely smiled clear cut stately countenances remained stern set except glowered us incuriously 
ayesha passed prostrated like rest 
went across moat climbing slope suddenly came upon host men gathered hollow square apparently order receive us 
stood ranks five six deep spear points glimmering moonlight looked like long bands level steel 
entered open side square spears lifted 
thrice lifted uplifting rose deep throated cry hiya arabic suppose salutation ayesha 
swept taking heed till came center square number men gathered prostrated usual fashion 
motioning rise said captains night within two hours march rezu sun worshippers since otherwise arts tell march us 
commands immortal fathers known generation generation destroyed servants destroyed rezu also drunk cup life numbers three one prepares queen set place people remain 
though added contemptuous laugh woman day could take place 
paused spokesman captains said hear hiya understand 
wouldst thou us lulala come earth armies rezu great beginning hated thee us also magic thy magic length days thy length days 
three thousand men match rezu son sun would better accept terms rezu light acknowledge king heard words saw tall shape ayesha quiver beneath robes think fear rage meaning clear enough namely rather risk battle rezu people contemplating surrender deposition indeed could deposed 
still answered quiet voice seems dealt gently fathers children lulala whose shadow upon earth see scabbard forgotten sword within shine forth smite 
well wrath brutish follow law brutes though true minded slay stand hearken less merciful would leave clutching hands rezu would drag one one stone sacrifice offer hearts god fire devour bodies heat 
bethink wives children forefathers knew dead days therefore may still would save heads glowing pot 
take counsel together say fight rezu yield desire speak morrow sun begone taking pointed us summoned help us war 
aye begone stretched upon stone sacrifice women children slaves men rezu shall cry oh hiya fathers knew oh return save us hell yes shall cry shall come answer since departed habitations moon thence appear 
consult together answer swiftly since weary ways 
captains drew apart began talk low voices ayesha stood still apparently quite unconcerned considered situation 
obvious people almost rebellion strange ruler whose power purely moral nature one emanated personality alone 
wondered seemed thought worth exercise 
remembered statement nowhere else must abide secret reason certain mystical gentleman greek name came fetch away appointed rendezvous 
therefore supposed choice rather suffering hallucinations believed choice obliged put crowd disagreeable savages quarters sadly repair 
presently spokesman returned saluted spear asked go fight rezu lead us battle hiya wisdom shall guide answered white man shall general stands warrior shall meet rezu face face bring dust pointed umslopogaas leaning upon axe watching contemptuous smile 
reply seem please man withdrew consult companions 
debate suppose animated amahagger men words indulge oratory advanced us spokesman said choice general please us hiya 
know white man brave fight made men rezu mountain yonder also followers weapons deal death afar 
prophecy among us none know beginning commands last great battle lulala rezu must produce eyes people lulala certain holy thing charm power without defeat portion lulala 
holy thing spirit haunted shape power know likeness fashion come among priests though told tell say speaks spirit body man yet man 
wondrous charm talisman might shown white lord asked ayesha coldly 
hiya word people lulala serve battle also word go rezu 
thou art mighty know well hiya also thou canst slay thou wilt know also rezu mightier thou hast power 
therefore kill us thou dost desire thy heart satisfied death 
better perish thus upon altar sacrifice wearing red hot crowns rezu 
say exclaimed rest company finished 
thought comes begin satisfy heart thy coward blood thy companions said ayesha contemptuously 
paused turning added watcher night counsel aught convince chicken hearted ones spread feathers long shook head blankly whereat murmured together made though would go 
hans understood something arabic african tongues pulled sleeve whispered ear 
great medicine baas show zikali great medicine 
idea 
description article required spirit haunted shape power spoke spirit body man yet man vague might mean anything nothing 
yet turned ayesha prayed ask wanted produced whether would follow bravely fight rezu death 
one voice replied aye bravely death bearer axe also legend tells 
deliberation opened shirt holding image zikali far chain elephant hair would allow asked holy thing charm power legend tells people amahagger worshippers lulala spokesman glanced snatching brand watch fire burnt near held carving stared stared others bending 
dog would singe beard cried affected rage seizing brand hand smote head 
took heed affront offered merely assert authority 
still moments stared although sparks wood frizzling greasy hair sudden went face others cried holy thing spirit haunted shape power worshippers lulala follow thee death white lord watcher night 
yes thou goest goes bears axe thither follow till one us left upon feet 
settled said yawning since never wise show concern anything savages 
indeed personally wish leader peculiar tribe adventure knew nothing therefore hoped would leave honor someone else 
turned told umslopogaas passed tale shrugged great shoulders handling axe though minded try edge upon dark lovers named amahagger people nocturnal habits 
meanwhile ayesha gave certain orders 
came said men march three thousand strong dawn camp northern mountain crest 
sunrise litters come bear join midday 
afternoon marshall think wise battle take place small hours following morning since people lulala fight night 
said 
come us asked dismayed 
nay war rezu matters

third day morrow shall meet flesh beyond think flesh claim reward journeyed seek 
place shall prepared white lady rezu would set rival queen 
farewell farewell also yonder bearer axe shall drink blood rezu also little yellow man rightly named light darkness shall learn ere done 
could speak turned glided away swiftly surrounded guards leaving astonished uncomfortable 
chapter xvi allan vision old chamberlain billali conducted us back camp 
went discoursed amahagger seemed developed specimen one threw back perhaps tens generations superior ancestor lived became debased 
substance told wild lawless lot lived amongst ruins caves swamp dwellings small separate communities governed petty headman generally priest goddess lulala 
originally people rezu times worshipped sun moon jointly thousands years ago expressed separated rezuites gone dwell north great mountain whence continually threatened lulalaites commands would destroyed long 
rezuites seemed habitual cannibals whereas lulalaite branch amahagger practiced cannibalism occasionally lucky chance got hold strangers 
watcher night companions added meaning 
crime discovered however hiya commands punished death 
asked exercised active rule people 
answered lacked sufficient interest angry individuals would destroy arts power chose 
indeed never seen knew existence rumor 
spirit goddess inhabited ancient tombs lay south old city whither come threatened war rezu alone feared know 
told moreover greatest magician ever certain die since forefathers knew generations ago 
still seemed curse like amahagger descendants inhabited k r country round far sea coast hundreds miles inland mighty people day great plague destroyed 
rest thought unhappy woman lived soul mourning dead consorting none upon earth 
asked stayed whereat shook head replied supposed curse since could conceive reason 
informed also moods varied much 
sometimes fierce active others comparison mild low spirited 
passing one latter stages perhaps rezu trouble wish people destroyed terrible person perhaps reason acquainted 
chose knew things except distant future 
thus knew coming also details march attacked rezuites going meet returning company sent afar find white queen 
therefore ordered go soldiers assistance 
asked went veiled replied beauty drove even savage men mad old days obliged kill number 
seemed know except kind served well like protected evil every sort 
asked rezu 
answered dreadful person undying said like commands though never seen man never wanted 
followers cannibals literally eaten could reach desirous conquering people lulala might eat also leisure 
eat dog eat dog therefore beginning grow hungry although plenty grain cattle used milk hides 
coming battle knew nothing would happen save commands said would go well lulalaites direction 
sure would go well think worth accompany army hated noise bloodshed 
occurred perhaps afraid would taken captive eaten kept reflection

umslopogaas hans also went away sleep leaving alone taken repose afternoon feel drowsy moment 
lovely night indeed made mind take little walk midnight hours manner amahagger recognized generalissimo forces little fear attacked especially carried pistol pocket

really tempted believe suffering delusions perhaps fact lay stretched upon bed delirium fever 
marvellous woman instance even rejecting tale miraculously extended life make know except wondrous remained clear claimed great deal power possessed 
evident tone interview captains fact shuffled command tribe shoulders 
mighty command bring celestial infernal powers bear upon enemy could say one fact emerged namely interesting beautiful uncommonly clever bargain 
task laid upon lead battle foe unascertained strength mob savages probably quite undisciplined whose fighting qualities knew nothing opportunity organising 
affair seemed madness could hope luck destiny would take somehow 
tell truth believed would grown almost superstitious zikali great medicine hans 
certainly effect upon captains odd would explanation come flash 
first night meeting described showed talisman ayesha kind letter credentials could see arranged scene captains tribal magician order get way appointment command 
everything conduct bore even feigning ignorance existence charm leaving hans suggest production perhaps influencing mind subconsciously 
doubt less fitted one nebulous traditions common amongst ancient savage races therefore shown confederate confederates would accepted common people holy sign rest easy

ten clock reached foot encircling cliffs began climb escarpment steep tortuous difficult 
noon reached crest found little army encamped except sentries sleeping seemed invariable custom people daytime

accompanied umslopogaas hans zulus guard also three head captains amahagger walked forward study lie land 
coming edge escarpment found place two broad based ridges shaped like spring boles certain tropical forest trees ran crest plain beneath gentle slope 
moreover saw plain ends ridges army encamped aid glasses examined estimated number least ten thousand men 
army amahagger captains informed rezu said intended commence attack dawn following morning since people rezu sun worshippers would never fight god appeared horizon 
studied see asked captains set plan battle plan 
chief answered advance halfway right hand ridge spot narrow flat piece ground await attack since place smaller numbers would much matter whereas made impossible assail enemy 
suppose rezu choose come ridge get behind 
would happen inquired 
replied know ideas strategy clear primitive order 
people fight best night day went 
said undoubtedly night indeed history record done daytime 
yet propose let rezu join battle sun high words court defeat remarked 
went aside discussed things umslopogaas hans returned gave orders declining argument 
briefly dusk rising moon amahagger must advance right hand ridge complete silence hide among scrub saw grew thickly near root 
small party however leadership goroko knew brave clever captain pass halfway left hand ridge light fires wide area make enemy think whole force encamped 
proper moment yet decided upon would attack army rezu 
amahagger captains seem pleased plan think bold fancy began murmur together 
seeing must assert authority walked said chief man hearken friend 
wish mine appointed general expect obeyed without question 
moment advance begins keep close black one much one men hesitates turns back die nodded towards axe umslopogaas 
moreover afterwards commands see others die escape fight 
still hesitated 
thereon without another word produced zikali great medicine held eyes result sight ugly thing even threat death could 
went flat ground every one swore lulala commands priestess would said however mad seemed 
good answered 
go back make ready rest time morrow shall know mad 
moment till end trouble amahagger 
get quickly story fight whereof preliminary details matter 
proper time goroko went two hundred fifty men one two zulus light fires agreed signal namely firing two shots rapid succession begin shouting generally make much noise could 
also went remaining three thousand moon rose crept quietly ghosts right hand ridge 
silent folk accustomed move night could see dark almost well cats amahagger executed maneuver splendidly wrapping spear blades bands dry grass lest light glint betray movements 
due course came patch bush ridge widened five hundred yards plain beneath lay four companies regiments seven hundred fifty strong 
moon risen mist covered surface plain could see nothing camp rezu knew must within thousand yards us unless indeed moved silence seemed suggest 
circumstance gave much anxiety since feared lest abandoning reputed habits rezuites also contemplating night attack 
umslopogaas disturbed subject though goroko men whose fires began twinkle opposing ridge something mile away could pass without knowledge 
still aught knew might ways scaling mountain 
trust amahagger declared none existed since local knowledge slight never visited northern slopes fear rezu 
supposing enemy gained crest suddenly assaulted us rear thought made feel cold back 
wondering could find truth hans squatted behind bush suddenly rose gave rifle carrying remaining zulu

thought remembered red beard knees praying heaven habit nothing else baas makes noise like 
crept towards sound presently found red beard tied upon stone looking mad buffalo bull stuck swamp shook head rolled eyes though two bottles bad gin baas kept saying prayers 
thought would cut loose bent ill luck saw face began shout saying go away yellow devil 
know come take hell soon hands loose would twist head shoulders 
said english baas know understand quite well sure better leave alone 
whilst thinking came hut two old men dressed night shirts white people wear yellow things upon heads metal picture sun front 
medicine men suggested 
yes baas predikants sort rather like reverend father dressed went box preach 
seeing slipped back little way mist began lay listened 
looked red beard shouts brought took notice went making noise like beetle tin 
nothing said one predikants tongue amahagger use 
sacrificed soon hope sleep noise makes 
edge sun appears answered predikant 
new queen brought hut white man sacrificed 
think pity wait long said first predikant never shall sleep peace red hot pot head 
first victory feast answered second predikant though good eat fat young woman new queen 
baas smacked lips one went back towards hut 
go back 
sat ground glowered baas red beard upon stone 
struck face make quiet 
baas saw remembered said eaten janee liked although fool spirit grew angry thought would give old skellum ie rascal predikant taste sacrifice purposed creep hut see could get speech lady sad eyes 
wriggled behind predikant sat glowering red beard stuck knife back thought would kill 
baas fell face began make noise like wounded hyena could finish 
heard sound shouts save life obliged run away mist without loosing red beard seeing lady sad eyes 
ran hard baas making wide circle left last got back 
baas 
quite enough answered though see death medicine man may frighten 
poor janee well hope come even devils three hours older 
called umslopogaas amahagger captains told substance story also hans located army part 
end made minds attack indeed insisted determined could save unfortunate man robertson hans account evidently quite mad raving 
fired two shots arranged presently heard sound distant shoutings slope opposing ridge 
minutes later started umslopogaas leading vanguard amahagger captains following three remaining companies 
reader presuming existence person think everything sure go right cunning old fellow allan quatermain going surprise wipe floor rezuites already beguiled trick instructed goroko play 
rescue robertson doubtless shortly recovers mind also inez greatest ease fact everything happen ought romance instead mere record remarkable facts 
latter happened matters work quite convenient way 
begin amahagger told rezuites never fought dark sun well either lied much mistaken rate occasion exact contrary 
thought stalking stalking us 
goroko maneuver deceived least since spies knew exact significance 
may add spies ranks traitors short really pay rezu possibly belonged abominable faith slipped away time time enemy report progress plans far knew 
hans stumbled mere rear guard left around place sacrifice hut inez confined 
real army never found 
divided two bodies hidden bush right left ridge descending spot joined plain beneath jaws two armies marched gaily 
hypothetical reader say silly old fool allan think things remember commanding pack savages real acquaintance among sure traitors especially blood rezuites take precautions ah dear reader answer wish handled job enjoyed opportunity seeing could circumstances 
suppose think points course 
ever heard difficulty making silk purses sows ears turning lot gloomy disagreeable barbarians never even drilled trustworthy efficient soldiers ready fight three times number beat also beg observe get somehow shall learn might done mr wisdom though admit without help another quarter 
well sit armchair sapient turn learned nose like gentlemen criticise plays poems easy job compared writing 
however understand tell truth rather ashamed followed since qui excuse accuse 
slunk hill moonlight queer looking crowd admit also felt uncomfortable 
begin like remark medicine man hans reported effect feast must come victory especially said robertson sacrificed sun rose would seem suggest victory planned take place event 
ruminating upon subject looked round hans cross examine priest exact words find slunk somewhere 
minutes later reappeared running back towards us swiftly noticed taking shelter behind tree trunks rocks came 
baas gasped breath careful rezu men either side ahead 
went forward ran 
threw many spears 
look showed slight cut arm blood flowing 
instantly understood ambushed began think hard indeed 
chanced passing across large flat space upon ridge say seven eight acres extent bush grew lightly though owing soil better trees tall 
steep slope little plain seemed denser according hans ambush set 
halted regiment sent back messengers others halt also came pretext giving rest marshalled advanced battle 
told umslopogaas hans said asked send zulu soldier could trust see could obtain confirmation report 

also asked thought done supposing true 
form amahagger ring square await attack answered 
nodded opinion replied zulus plan would good 
know men stand know nothing macumazahn therefore try 
run must hill 
called captains told toward seemed alarm much 
indeed one two wanted retreat said would shoot first man tried 
end agreed plan said would post best soldiers top square orders stop attempt flight mountain 
formed square best could arranging rather rough four fold line 
heard shouts presently zulu returned reported hans said rezu men moving round us discovered thought halted escaped ambush 
still attack develop reason rezu army crawling steep flanks spur either side level piece ground view encircling us altogether make clean sweep force 
matter fact considered point view fortunate move since thereby stopped attempt retreat part amahagger whose bolt hole blocked 
done could sat least waited 
night remember strangely still slopes either side plateau came kind rustling sound fact caused feet rezu people marched surround us 
ceased last silence grew complete much could hear teeth tall amahagger chattering fear sound gave little confidence caused umslopogaas remark hearts big men never grown remained babies 
told captains pass word ranks stood might live fled would certainly die 
therefore wished see homes better stand fight like men 
otherwise would killed rest eaten rezu 
done observed message seemed produce steadying effect upon ranks 
suddenly around us either side broke awful roar seemed shape word rezu next minute also either side ten thousand men poured forth upon square 
moonlight looked terrible flowing white robes great gleaming spears 
hans fired shots though effect produced might well pelted breaker pebbles 
thought useful alive dead retreated within square umslopogaas zulu hans coming 
whole amahagger stood attack better expected 
beat back first rush considerable loss enemy also second longer struggle 
pause formed ranks dragging wounded men square 
scarcely done another mighty shout rezu enemy attacked hour battle begun 
changed tactics instead trying rush sides square concentrated efforts western front faced towards plain 
came among forefront battle caught sight gigantic man huge creature seemed seven feet high big proportion 
could see clearly uncertain moonlight noted fierce aspect also enormous beard black streaked gray flowed middle hair hung masses upon shoulders 
rezu shouted umslopogaas 
aye macumazahn rezu without doubt rejoice see worthy foe fight 
look carries axe 
must save strength come face face shall need 
thought would spare umslopogaas exertion watched opportunity put bullet giant 
could never get one 
covered amahagger rushed front gun could shoot second chance came little cloud floated face moon made invisible 
things attend since expected would happen western face square gave yelling like devils enemy began pour gap 
cold thrill went saw game 
form undisciplined amahagger impossible nothing expected except panic rout slaughter 
cursed folly ever anything business hans screamed thin voice chance us three zulu bolt hide bush 
answer apart nasty pride thing impossible could get struggling masses men surrounded us every side clock struck went making kind mental sandwich prayers curses prayers soul forgiveness sins curses amahagger everything especially zikali woman called ayesha led affair 
perhaps great medicine zikali piped hans fired rifle advancing foe 
hang great medicine shouted back ayesha 
wonder declined take hand business 
spoke words saw old billali man war keeping close us could go flat onto venerable face reflected must got thrown spear 
casting hurried glance see done wounded corner eye caught sight something diaphanous gleamed moonlight reminded knew moment 
looked round quickly see might lo almost side veiled ayesha holding hand little rod made black wood inlaid ivory unlike field marshal baton sceptre 
never saw come day know must put luminous paint something else robes gleamed sort faint phosphorescent fire moonlight made conspicuous field battle 
speak single word waved rod pointed towards fierce hordes drawing near us killing came began move forward gliding motion 
every side went roar commands commands people rezu front shouted lulala lulala fly lulala upon us witchcrafts moon moved forward strange impulse order given began move 
yes ranks minute beginning give way wild panic became filled marvellous courage moved 
men rezu also suppose rezu saw time began move uncommonly fast edge plateau towards plain beneath 
fact broke flight leaping dead dying rushed always following gleaming robe ayesha must extremely agile person since without apparent exertion held place steps ahead us 
another curious circumstance affair namely terrified though rezuites first break soon seemed find impossible depart speed 
kept turning round look behind following vision though many lot wives 
moreover fate overtook many fell upon scriptural lady since appeared become petrified stood quite still like rabbits fascinated snake people came killed 
slaying went last steep slope ridge suppose least two thirds army rezu must perished since amahagger showed handy men came exterminating foes terror struck fight exhilarated occupation gained courage every moment 
chapter xviii slaying rezu last plain bemused remnant rezu army still doubling us like mob game pursued wild dogs 
halted form ranks seemed although still spoke word order reached gleaming ayesha 
business took twenty minutes numbering two thousand five hundred strong rest fallen fight square advanced 
came dusk often precedes rising sun could see battle yet since gathered front us still force equal 
ayesha pointed towards wand leapt forward attack 
men rezu stood awaiting us seemed overcome terror approach day 
battle fierce strange battle dim uncertain light scarcely showed us friend foe 
indeed sure since ayesha longer visible give amahagger confidence courage rezuites increased seemed lessen passing night 
fortunately however issue hung doubtful shout left looking made tall shape goroko witch doctor zulu followed two hundred fifty men leaping flank line rezu 
settled business 
enemy crumpled melted first lights dawn appeared sky 
looked ayesha gone knew though moment feared must killed l e gave looking thinking since never time action 
signalling shouting hatchet faced amahagger advance accompanied umslopogaas goroko joined us hans sprang forward give example took 
mound red beard cried hans faced little slope 
ran gloom precedes actual dawn saw group men gathered round something people collect street accident 
red beard stone 
killing screeched hans 
least several white robed priests bending prostrate figure knives hands behind stood huge fellow took rezu staring towards east though waiting rim sun appear gave order 
moment appear thin edge bright light horizon turned shouting order 
late 
umslopogaas cut one priests axe men dealt others hans couple sweeps long knife severed cords robertson tied 
poor man growing light could see raving mad sprang calling something scotch deil 
seizing great spear fallen hand one priests rushed furiously giant given order yell drove heart 
saw spear snap concluded man rightly took rezu wore kind armor 
next instant axe held great weapon flashed aloft went robertson awful stroke stone dead found afterwards cloven almost two 
sight death poor friend rage took hold 
hand double barrelled rifle express loaded hollow pointed bullets 
covered giant let drive first one barrel distinctly heard bullets strike upon 
yet fall 
rocked little turned marched towards hut whereof hans told stood fifty yards away 
leave shouted umslopogaas 
steel cuts bullets pierce bound like buck great zulu leapt away 
think rezu meant enter hut purpose umslopogaas hard upon tracks 
rate ran past slope little hill plain behind remnants army trying form 
front giant turned stood bay 
umslopogaas halted also waiting us come since cunning old warrior feared lest begin fight happened horde would fall 
thirty seconds later arrived found standing still bent body small shield advanced great axe raised though act striking wondrous picture outlined swiftly rising sun 
ten paces away stood giant leaning axe bore unlike woodmen fell big trees 
evil man see first full sight likened mind goliath david overthrew 
huge hairy deep set piercing eyes great hooked nose 
face seemed thin ancient also motion great head tossed long locks back limbs hercules movements full youthful vigor 
moreover aspect whole devil rather man indeed sight sickened 
let shoot cried umslopogaas reloaded rifle ran 
nay watcher night answered zulu without moving head rifle chance failed 
let us see axe 
kill man borne hence feet first shall made long journey nothing 
giant began talk low rumbling voice reverberated slope little hill behind us 
asked speaking tongue amahagger use dare come face face rezu black hound know slain lived year every week life days set foot upon necks men thousands 
seen spear shatter iron balls melt upon breast like rain drops would try bring toy carry army defeated know 
matters get sacrifice completed white queen wed therefore army defeated magic lulala white witch dwells tombs 
defeated slain show back certain axe long ago rusted dust 
long speech umslopogaas understood nothing answered briefly enough point flashed mind ayesha tale axe 
certain axe cried 
aye certain axe well look held black one captain named slaughterer ancient axe whose title chieftainess wills takes lives 
look well rezu giant wizard say whether forefather lost destined bring doom thus spoke loudly might hear slowly also pausing word wished give time light strengthen seeing rays rising sun struck upon face giant whereas eyes umslopogaas less dazzled 
rezu heard stared axe umslopogaas held aloft causing quiver slightly imperceptible motion arm 
stared saw hideous face change first time gathered look something resembling fear 
also followers behind also studying axe began murmur together 
say though common consent battle stayed longer attacked enemy longer ran 
whose left stood still though felt real ultimate issue fight depended upon forthcoming duel two champions though issue little doubt since learned afterwards believed king invulnerable 
quite rezu went staring 
said aloud thinking 
like like 
horn haft pointed gouge blade shaped like young moon 
almost could think shook ancient holy axe 
nay gods taken back long ago trick witch lulala caves 
thus spoke still moment hesitated 
umslopogaas said deep silence followed hear 
hear answered without turning head moving arms 
counsel watcher night slaughterer 
strike man face breast think protected witchcraft armor 
get behind strike back 
understand nay macumazahn understand 
yet bidding wiser utter empty words 
still 
umslopogaas threw axe air caught fell began chant praises zulu fashion 
oho said child lion black maned lion whose claws never loosened prey 
wolf king hunted wolves upon witch mountain brother bearer club named watcher fords slew called unconquered chief people axe bore ancient axe smote halakazi tribe caves nada lily wife 
took king dingaan gift loved little afterward mopo foster sire hurled dingaan death 
royal one named bulalio slaughterer named woodpecker named umhlopekazi captain never yet man stood fair open fight 
thou wizard rezu thou giant thou ghost man come sun risen hand breadth watch shall see us better game war 
come come say blood boils feet grow cold 
come thou grinning dog thou monster grown fat eating flesh men thou hook beaked vulture thou old gray whiskered wolf thus changed fierce boastful way two remaining zulus clapped hands sentence sentence echoed words goroko witch doctor muttered incantations behind 
sang thus umslopogaas began stir 
first head shoulders moved gently swaying side side like reed shaken wind snake strike 
slowly put first one foot next drew back dancer might tempting rezu attack 
giant would shield held stood still waited see black warrior would 
snake struck 
umslopogaas darted let drive long axe 
rezu raised shield head caught blow 
clank made knew shield seemed hide lined iron 
rezu smote back blow could fall zulu reach 
taught great giant strength though stroke heavy like steel hatted axe bore still saw missed checked weapon mid air mighty man could done 
umslopogaas saw things also changed tactics 
axe six eight inches longer haft rezu therefore could reach rezu could giant short armed 
twisted round hand moon shaped blade uppermost keeping almost full length began peck gouge shaped point back head arms rezu knew favorite trick fight name woodpecker 
rezu defended head shield best could sharp points steel flashed 
twice seemed zulu pecks went home upon giant breast harm 
either rezu thick beard armor beneath stopped penetrating body 
still roared though pain fury growing mad charged umslopogaas smote strength 
zulu caught blow upon shield shore though tough hide paper 
stay stroke could yet turned direction falling axe slid past umslopogaas shoulder hurt 
next instant rezu could strike zulu threw severed shield face seizing axe hands leapt struck 
mighty blow saw rhinoceros horn handle famous axe bend like drawn bow went home dull thud full upon rezu breast 
shook 
evidently razor edge inkosikaas failed pierce 
sound though hollow tree smitten strands long beard shorn fell ground 
tagati bewitched cried watching zulus 
stroke cut two thought man knew make good armor 
rezu laughed aloud bellowing kind laugh umslopogaas sprang back astonished 
thus cried zulu 
well wizards door spirit enters departs 
must find door must find door spoke springing movements tried get past rezu first right left keeping reach 
rezu ever turned faced retreating step step slope little hill striking whenever found chance without avail always umslopogaas beyond reach 
also sunlight grew strong dazzled thought 
moreover seemed tire somewhat thought also 
rate determined make end play swift motion umslopogaas done threw away shield grasping iron handle axe hands charged zulu like bull 
umslopogaas leapt back reach 
suddenly turned ran rise 
yes bulalio slaughterer ran roar mockery went sun worshippers behind amahagger laughed goroko two zulus stared astonished ashamed 
read mind aright wondered guile conceived 
ran rezu ran never could catch swiftest footed man zululand 
fro followed umslopogaas taking zig zag path towards crest slope till length rezu stopped breathless 
umslopogaas still ran another twenty yards reached top slope halted wheeled round 
ten seconds stood drawing breath great gasps looking face saw become face wolf 
lips drawn terrible grin showing white teeth cheeks seemed fallen eyes glared skin hole forehead beat 
stood gathering together mighty effort 
run shouted spectators 
run back k r black dog umslopogaas knew mocking took heed bent rubbed sweating hand grit dry earth 
straightened charged rezu 
allan quatermain seen many things battle never since see aught like charge 
swift lioness swift zulu feet scarcely seemed touch ground 
sped like thrown spear till within dozen feet rezu stood staring bent frame almost double leapt air 
oh leap 
surely must learned lion spring buck 
high rose saw purpose clear tall shape rezu 
aye cleared half foot spare passed smote downwards axe blow fell upon back rezu head 
moreover went home time saw red blood stream rezu fell forward face 
umslopogaas landed far beyond ran little way must wheeled round charged 
rezu rising gained feet axe inkosikaas thundered neck joins shoulder sank 
still great strength rezu found feet smote wildly 
movements slow umslopogaas got behind smiting back 
twice thrice smote third blow seemed though massive spine severed weapon fell rezu hand slowly sank ground lay huddled heap 
believing ran lay umslopogaas standing seemed utterly exhausted supported axe tottered upon feet 
rezu yet dead 
opened cavernous eyes glared zulu look hellish hate 
thou hast conquered black one gasped 
thine axe gave thee victory ancient holy axe mine woman stole yes craft witch caves told thee smite spirit life feared enter wholly kissed flesh left mortal 
wolf black man may meet elsewhere fight fray 
ah would could get hands thy throat take thee darkness 
lulala wins since fate think shall worse mine 
ah see magic beauty boasts turn shameful sudden life left throwing great arms wide last breath passed bubbling lips 
stooped examine man huge hairy carcase looked half human thunder feet amahagger rushed upon us thrusting aside fell upon body ancient foe like hounds upon helpless fox hands spears knives literally tore hacked limb limb till semblance humanity remained 
impossible stop indeed outworn labors emotions make attempt 
regret since lost opportunity making examination body troll like man ascertaining kind armor wore beneath great beard strong enough stop bullets even razor edge axe inkosikaas driven might arms zulu bulalio 
looked sickening sight giant scattered fragments armor whatever might gone rent little pieces carried doubtless amahagger perhaps divided serve charms 
rezu know hugest terrible looking man ever seen one carried vast strength late life since aspect countenance imagine must nigh upon seventy years age though supposed unnatural antiquity course nothing fable put natives purposes 
presently umslopogaas seemed recover kind faint fallen opening eyes looked 
first person fell old billali stood stroking white beard contemplating scene air philosophic satisfied 
seemed anger umslopogaas cried think ancient bag words sweeper paths feet great made mock thought fled horns yonder man eating bull nodded towards fragments rezu 
find axe though weak weary wash away insult blood 
glorious black hero say watcher night asked billali courteous tones 
told word word whereon billali lifted hands horror turned fled 
see arrived k r sight fall giant chief rezu believed invulnerable followers watching fray set great wailing mournful uncanny noise hear 
think hosts philistines david brought goliath admirable shot stone set homes wherever may absolutely record pace completest disarray 
amahagger followed soon left standing still 
contented killing wounded could find returned 
accompany indeed battle metaphorically washed hands thoughts consigned certain locality people might well said manners none customs simply beastly 
also although fierce cruel night bats good fighting men short never wish another company 
moreover different matter pressed 
object business far concerned rescue poor inez since sake never would consented lead amahagger fellow blackguards rezuites 
inez hans understood medicine man aright hut earnest hope still remained since otherwise hunt must continued 
rate easy discover 
calling hans amusing taking long shots flying enemy might forget said zulus walked slope hut rather booth boughs quite twenty feet long twelve fifteen broad 
eastern end doorway opening closed heavy curtain 
paused full tremors listened tell truth dreaded draw curtain fearing might see within 
gathering courage length tore aside revolver hand looked 
first strong light without sun well could see nothing since green boughs palm leaves closely woven 
eyes grew accustomed gloom however perceived glittering object seated kind throne end booth double row front knelt six white robed women seemed wear chains necks carried large knives slung round middles 
floor women throne lay dead man priest sort gathered garb still held huge spear hand 
silent figure throne knelt first thought must dead

rate got dead dying blows strong true one lived minutes 
advanced figure throne rather foot stooled chair black wood inlaid ivory sat silent motionless certain dead woman especially perceived fastened chair leather straps sewn gold wire 
also veiled one exception made may use term exactly resemble lady ayesha even two long plaits black hair finished kind pearl sandalled feet 
exception hung great necklace gold ornaments suspended pendants also gold representing rayed disc sun rude bold striking workmanship 
went cut straps since could stop untie knots lifted veil

end long pursuit thus rescued inez zulus called lady sad eyes 
chapter xix spell return k r need say nothing except due course reached interesting ruin 
journey chiefly remarkable one thing occasion imagine first last time life umslopogaas consented carried litter least part way 
said unwounded axe mighty foe never much touched skin 
suffered shock kind collapse since although would thought great utterly fearless warrior bottom nervous highly strung man 
nervous climb highest points anything true fights others 
fearful fray rezu great strain zulu 
put wizard sucked strength especially found owing armor could harm front owing cunning could get behind 
conceived desperate expedient leaping head smiting backwards leapt trick told played years young order break shield ring reach one stood center

well made thereby conquered end said left weak snake crawls hole sun long winter sleep 
one thing umslopogaas added thankful namely rezu never succeeded getting arms round since quite certain would broken baboon breaks mealie stalk 
strength even could resisted iron might huge gorilla like man 
agreed noted rezu vast chest swelling muscles also weight blows struck steel hafted axe way sought missing stolen suppose one amahagger 
whence strength come wondered one face appeared old perchance truth legend samson dwell gigantic beard long locks impossible say probably man herculean freak strong hercules stories heard afterwards feats left little room doubt 
one thing certain connection namely tales supernatural abilities merest humbug 
simply one representatives family strong men examples still seen marvellous feats earth 
rest dead broken amahagger blood hounds could examine body armor either end story 
looked corpse poor robertson buried fell saw though large thick set cleft almost two single blow rezu axe came understand might savage must 
say savage sure right description rezu 
evidently religion sort also imagination shown theft white woman queen veiling resemble ayesha dreaded intended propitiatory sacrifice guard women sworn service slew priest tried kill afterwards committed suicide failed office things

know matters nothing 
rezu dead world well rid want learn people go study remain habitat part never wish visit 
journey k r poor inez never stirred 
whenever went look litter found lying eyes open fixed stare upon face frightened much since began fear lest die 
however could nothing help except urge bearers top speed 
swiftly travel hill across plain reached k r sun setting 
crossed moat perceived old billali coming meet us 
many bows keeping anxious eye upon litter learned contained umslopogaas 
indeed attitude amahagger towards two us even hans thenceforward became almost abject since victory rezu death beneath axe looked upon us half divine treated us accordingly 
mighty general said commands bids conduct lady sick place made ready near may watch 
wondered ayesha knew inez sick tired ask questions merely bade lead 
taking us another ruined house next quarters swept cleaned furnished fashion moreover cleverly roofed mats really quite comfortable 
found two middle aged women superior type billali informed trade nurses sick 
seen laid upon bed committed inez charge since case one dared try doctor knowing drug possessed administered 
moreover billali comforted information soon commands would visit make well could 
answered hoped went quarters found excellent meal ready cooked stone flagon contents billali said three drink command ayesha declared would take away weariness 
tried stuff pale yellow color like sherry aught knew might poison find comforting though seem strong taste 
certainly effects wonderful since presently great weariness fell like discarded cloak found splendid appetite feeling better stronger done years 
short drink cocktail best one wish possessed recipe though ayesha told afterwards distilled quite harmless herbs sense spirit 
discovered gave hans also umslopogaas wounded zulus found progressing well towards complete recovery lastly goroko also worn 
effect magical brew proved satisfactory 
washed ate splendid dinner though respect hans seated ground nearby far outpassed finest efforts 
baas said things gone well us might gone ill 
baas red beard dead good thing since madman would difficult look brain full moonshine bad companion one 
oh without doubt better dead though reverend father predikant hard job looking place fires 
perhaps said sigh since better dead live lunatic

oh baas perhaps missed hit things sometimes think always 
waited see would rise piece insolence course went way letting easily perhaps wore good armor beard saw amahagger pulled hair cut pieces go away looked like little bits brass 
also great medicine meant killed umslopogaas since otherwise umslopogaas would sad rest life whereas walk world proud cock two tails crow night well day
