harry listened closely knew father giving voice hopes beliefs

big things going happen first 
harry watched rode away wondered would meet 
like colonel leonidas talbot felt going great war wide sweep 
harry returned hotel thoughtful 
second parting cousin playmate life painful realized wondering would meet might never occur 
found father friends holding close conference room hotel 
senator culver mr bracken gardner editor others yet higher councils confederacy 
bertrand sat corner saying little watching everything ardent burning eyes 
letters come chief southern leaders 
one jefferson davis another astute benjamin another toombs bold brusque befitted temperament yet stephens slidell yancey others 
colonel kenton read one one twenty men crowded room 
appealing insistent urgent 
tone might vary tenor 
must take kentucky union take 
west line attack upon south would lead kentucky 
state threw fortunes south advance lincoln troops would blocked 
force example would immense hundred thousand valiant kentuckians could easily turn scale favor confederacy 
harry listened long time growing tired last went fresh air 
young though realized one thing southern leaders ask another thing kentuckians deliver 
saw signs powerful opposition saw forces scattered first consolidating fast presenting formidable front 
struggle began waged days picturesque old capitol 
violence feeling deepened 
men put restraint upon words hearts behind full bitterness bitterness one side northern sympathizers stubborn bitterness southern sympathizers showed stubbornness 
friends lifetime used cold words saw widening gulf none could cross 
supporters either cause poured little capital 
tremendous pressure brought bear upon house senate 
members compelled strive every kind emotion appeal love union cool judgment midst alarms state patriotism kinship conflicting ties pull stand upon border line eve great civil war 
yet could come decision 
day day fought back forth points order resolutions result always 
north south locked fast within two rooms one little capitol 
rimmed around meanwhile fiery horizon steadily came closer closer 
guns reducing sumter sufficient signal 
north south sharply arrayed 
southern volunteers full ardor fire continued pour standards

see could frankfort wanted virginia fields bayonets would soon meet 
curious feeling war could come land persisted harry 
late afternoon lower tip sun hid behind far hills landscape looked upon soft beautiful 
green spring deep tender 
everything rough ugly smoothed away first mellow touch advancing twilight 
hills clothed robe green lay valleys center circle flowed deep kentucky serene blue 
harry thoughts moment war really feeling anybody 
general impersonal 
something pure noble boy comes good home something lofty man later looks back pride boy wise powerful heart good 
twilight slowly darkened green fields blue river 
noble stone sculptured lines side harry sat seemed grow whiter despite veil dusk drooping softly 
houses town began sink sight lights appeared place 
night came found boy still place 
could see tint blue river far hills lost darkness 
chill evening coming rising shook little 
followed path steep hill along edge river 
paused standing side great oak grew water margin looked kentucky 
harry could see point stood sign human life 
heard murmur deep waters flowed slowly peacefully 
spirit great ancestor famous henry ware sword border strong upon 
kentucky romantic rivers clustered thick facts legends great days first pioneers came built homes along banks 
flowed mountains still mysterious moments harry thoughts floated strife present time far back slightest noise canebrake might mean hunter coming quarry 
faint musical sound sigh stray breeze came point far stream 
listened sound pleased 
lone weird note full accord night mood presently knew 
mountaineer raft singing plaintive song distant hills 
huge rafts launched headwaters stream mountains eastern part state came great numbers river oftenest time year 
stopped frankfort others went ohio cities stream 
harry waited song grew little volume penned high banks gave back soft echoes 
raft came slowly fast current river 
thought would see light men usually cooked slept rude little hut built center raft 
yet darkness 
singer however rude unlettered mountaineer may voice ear harry still listened keenest pleasure melodious note came floating river 
spell upon 
imagination became vivid mountaineer singing 
gone back another century 
one great borderers perhaps boone paddling canoe upon stream name danger 
kenton logan harrod others abroad woods 
engrossed deeply hear heavy step behind see huge bewhiskered figure path holding clubbed rifle

perhaps instinct inherited great ancestor said sixth sense 
whatever may faced suddenly saw bill skelly aiming blow clubbed rifle would crush skull send body deep stream 
inherited instinct made leap within swing rifle clutch mountaineer throat 
heavy butt swished air force blow jerked weapon skelly hands 
next instant struggling life 
harry powerful youth much stronger many men instant spirit strength great ancestor pouring veins 
treacherous attempt upon life filled rage 
truth forest runner earlier century strove great might slay enemy 
skelly six feet two inches tall two hundred pounds muscle sinew struck boy fiercely side head terrible grasp still throat 
larger stronger sudden leap upon gave younger smaller antagonist advantage 
pistol belt throttling grip upon throat forgot 
hunter suddenly become hunted 
filled rage venom expected easy triumph instead fighting life 
skelly struck boy harry instinctive wisdom pressed head close man chin skelly blows short range lacked force behind 
harry youthful powerful arms pouring strength hands grasped man throat 
mountaineer choked gasped changing aim head struck harry chest 
remembered draw pistol harry raising knee struck violently wrist 
pistol dropped ground skelly fierce struggle unable regain 
neither uttered cry 
single shout help 
skelly would want call attention harry recalled afterward tremendous tension moment thought never occurred

leaving men command reliable sergeant named carrick two youths crossed brook advanced fairly level stretch country toward fire 
small clusters trees scattered beyond field young corn

arrayed huge blouses vast baggy trousers blazing red fastened knee revealing stockings brilliant hue 
little tasselled caps perched sides heads 
harry remembering geography descriptions nations would taken gathering turkish women masculine faces hidden 
moon whispered

ah another force coming cavalry hear hoof beats harry harry heard distinctly comrade lay closely ever bushes horsemen numerous body heavy tread indicated passing near 
two lads presently saw riding four abreast toward campfire harry surmised scouting strong force toward southern front 
large men deep tan riding easily 
harry judged number two hundred tail company would pass alarmingly near bushes comrade lay 
think better creep back whispered st clair 
taking short cut may ride right upon us 
yes time make scarce 
turned back going rapidly dared harry feared came pass 
rear files horsemen evidently intending go side camp rode low bushes 
four passed near boys caught moonlight glimpse two stooping figures 
halt sharply cried one officer 
st clair cried also run harry run life keep bushes two dashed utmost speed strip bushes heard thunder horses hoofs open either flank 
half dozen shots fired bullets cut leaves twigs 
heard northern men shouting spies spies seize harry moment extreme danger retained presence mind cornfield arthur cried comrade 
fence staked ridered horses jump 
stop pull give us time get away good plan returned st clair 
better bend run 
bullets make flesh creep fresh volley sent bushes owing wise precaution bending low bullets went heads although harry felt hair rising meet 
two three minutes fence went almost like birds 
harry heard two bullets hit rails leaped view moment merely increased speed st clair darted side side corn bending low 
heard horsemen talking swearing barrier heard beat hoofs 
divide send force around field way said st clair 
dismount pursue us foot distance anybody foot 
harry heard bullets whistling felt could outrun horse giraffe antelope anything earth thunder harry feel way bullets fired fence made ploughed land fly far lengthened stride 
harry afterward said remember stepping cornfield twice 
fortunately field wide extended far right left pursuing horsemen compelled make great circuit 
thudding hoofs came near fence still wonderful powers flight scudding across country toward lines

sioux blackfeet back suppose scalped us yankees intentions exactly peaceful 
took advice gave 
examine earth tomorrow find footprints five times mile 
far right left scattering shots fired skirmishers night came touch one another 
hence adventure harry st clair attracted little attention 
shots long range fired nearly every night sometimes difficult keep raw recruits pulling trigger merely pleasure hearing report 
harry st clair related incident next morning colonel talbot spoke gravity 
many young men birth family army said must learn war serious business 
deadly business deadly business

nevertheless hoped surprise northern soldiers coffee 
reason men compelled lie blankets dark

harry sensitive keenly alive impressions oppressed certain heavy uncanny feeling 
going battle morning men hate 
attacks star west sumter bombardments distant affairs see face enemy would another matter 
real shock battle would come eyes men seeking kill would look eyes others also sought kill 
st clair sleepy slept day langdon already nodding 
soldiers also fallen asleep exhaustion harry saw dusk lying long rows 
faint moon throwing ghostly light many motionless forms made whole scene weird unreal harry 
shook cast spell closing eyes sought sleep 
sleep would come obstinate lids lifted 
turned little darker motionless forms far end line hidden 
nearer still seemed put stay forever 
st clair yielded last weariness back tree slept harry side 
saw four figures moving like ghosts shadows 
colonel talbot lieutenant colonel st hilaire two captains watching men seeing silence caution preserved 
harry knew sentinels posted ridge could see lay 
although long time forest human figures wavered last dozed 
soon awoke saw faint tint gray low east first timid herald dawn 
young soldiers awakened

new york new england troops suspect presence enemy 
lighting breakfast fires 
southern columns moved forward quiet still hidden forest also yet hid northern fort 
harry heart began beat heavily forced preserve appearance calmness 
pride stiffened backbone 
veteran

seen great bombardment taken part 
must show raw men soldier bore battle moreover officer whose business lead 
deep forest endured advanced diagonal line slope 
great civil war north america fought mostly forest often men aware presence one another came face face 
almost bottom valley opened grass land turning northward harry saw two figures ahead among trees 
men blue uniforms rifles hands staring surprise advancing columns gray 
surprise lasted moment 
lifted rifles fired straight invincibles warning shouts darted among trees toward troops 
forward lads shouted colonel talbot 
within four hundred yards fort must rush officers places bugle sang stirring music men gathered forward rush

saw northern officers earthwork disappear dropping behind young southern soldiers raised great shout triumph sank dying note merged tremendous crash 
whole fort seemed harry blaze red fire heavy guns fired straight faces invincibles 
roar cannon near harry instant deafened crash 
heard groans cries saw men falling around 
another moment came swish rifle bullets ranks invincibles cut torn lead 
young recruits receiving baptism fire accompanied many wounds death 
earthworks front hidden little drifting smoke invincibles mad pain rage rushed 
anxious get stinging terribly fortunately defenders time pour another volley 
harry saw colonel talbot still front waving sword near lieutenant colonel st hilaire also uplifted sword pointed straight toward earthwork

light guns invincibles unlimbered slope fired heads fort 
dare fire next instant recruits dripping red still wild rage earthworks driven rage climbed fired huddled mass saw 
harry stumbled went fort quickly recovered leaped feet

invincibles despite single close volley poured advantage surprise officers men skill experience 
left long red trail fallen entered fort single volley pressed hard bayonet 
little military knowledge less also less experience woods hills 
invincibles hurled upon defenders slowly gave way driven fort 
carried two cannon reached wood opened heavy fire upon pursuing southern troops made youngsters shiver reel back 
regular officers said colonel talbot lieutenant colonel st hilaire 
safe wager several old comrades mexico 
thus west pointers speak respect fellow west pointers 
exulting capture fort still driven rage invincibles attempted rush enemy met deadly fire many fell officers drew back shelter captured earthworks joined light guns hurried slope 
another volley fired went earthen walls harry threw upon ground heard ferocious whine bullets head sound would grow used years terribly long 
harry rose feet began feel see wounded 
great tension rapid movements conscious physical feeling

harry noted raking fire cannon effective 
northern troops retreated distant point forest beyond range rifles seemed intention going time time shell cannon still curved fell fort near 
southern guns including captured replied necessity shot shell sent random forest hid whole northern force

instead besiegers turned besieged 
expecting everything turn best said langdon know made anything exchange 
fort mechanics mill hands slope good position pepper us 
wait reinforcements said harry 
thought said st clair

northern troops ceased fire presently officers examining woods glasses said still 
came grim task burying dead done inside earthworks 
nearly two score invincibles fallen rise hundred wounded 
small loss even veteran force colonel talbot lieutenant colonel st hilaire looked grave 
many recruits turned white strange sinking sensations 
little laughter display triumph inside earthworks increase cheer recruits saw senior officers draw aside engage anxious talk 
thinking idea harry yankee reinforcements must occurred colonel talbot also said langdon 
seems nothing else fear 
yankees drove strong enough come back drive us

good rest resumed work pick shovel bayonet throwing earthworks higher ever higher 
clear three lads colonel talbot expected heavy attack 
perhaps underrated mill hands mechanics said st clair precise dandyish way 
may ride well shoot well seem hurry going back factories 
harry glanced 
st clair always extremely particular dress 
matter gave time thought freely 
despite digging trim immaculate showed signs perspiration

people north underrated us 
colonel talbot told long ago going terribly big war know right 
long time passed without demonstration part enemy 
sun reached zenith blazed redly upon men fort 
harry looked longingly dark green woods

three scouts sent colonel talbot returned reports justified suspicions 
heavy force evidently patterson army operating hills mountains marching valley join driven fort 
junction would formed within hour 
harry present report made understood significance 
rejoiced walls earth thrown much higher trenches dug much deeper 
middle afternoon cool shade beginning fall eastern forest noticed movement woods 
saw swaying bushes officers glasses caught glimpses men moving undergrowth 
came mighty crash shells battery great guns sang air burst 
well invincibles dug trenches deep two shells burst inside fort 
harry colonel talbot acting aide heard leader quiet comment reinforcements brought big guns

trenches deep well constructed chance pieces shell struck human targets 
harry remained colonel talbot ready carry order might give

see smoke covers whole side mountain 
oh carrington splendidly never known better harry wished carrington would quite well 
tired crouching ditch
