black forest breathed heavily fitful moans wind 
secrets 
glances wilson threw sides betrayed hunted man love dark night though hid 
wilson seemed fascinated life inclosed black circle spruce 
might reflecting strange reaction happening every man group since girl brought among 
nothing clear however forest kept secret melancholy wind outlaws sleeping like tired beasts dark secrets locked hearts 
wilson put sticks red embers pulled end log 
blaze sputtered changing dark circle showing sleepers set shadowed faces upturned 
wilson gazed sardonic smile lips look fixed upon sleeper apart others riggs

might truth expressed lonely unguarded hour depths man born south man inheritance race reverence womanhood whose strange wild outlawed bloody life gun fighter must hate deadliest hate type aped mocked fame 
long gaze wilson rested upon riggs strange secretive forest wind moaning great aisles dark gaze withdrawn wilson stalked away make bed stride one ill spirit liberated force 
laid saddle front spruce shelter girl entered tarpaulin blankets likewise wearily stretched long length rest 
camp fire blazed showing exquisite green brown flecked festooning spruce branches symmetrical perfect yet irregular burned died leaving dim gray starlight 
horses moving around moan night wind grown fainter low hum insects dying away even tinkle brook diminished 
growth toward absolute silence continued yet absolute silence never attained 
life abided forest changed form dark hours
