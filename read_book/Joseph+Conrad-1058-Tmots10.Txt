commanders ships take departure home coast sadly spirit grief discontent 
wife children perhaps affection rate perhaps pet vice must left behind year 
remember one man walked deck springy step gave first course passage elated voice 
learned afterwards leaving nothing behind except welter debts threats legal proceedings 
hand known many captains directly ship left narrow waters channel would disappear sight ship company altogether three days 
would take long dive state room emerge days afterwards less serene brow 
men easy get 
besides complete retirement seemed imply satisfactory amount trust officers trusted displeases seaman worthy name 
first voyage chief mate good captain macw remember felt quite flattered went blithely duties commander practical purposes 
still whatever greatness illusion fact remained real commander backing self confidence though invisible eyes behind maple wood veneered cabin door white china handle 
time departure taken spirit commander communes muffled voice sanctum sanctorum temple call temple hell afloat ships called captain state room surely august place every vessel 
good macw would even come meals fed solitarily holy holies tray covered white napkin 
steward used bend ironic glance perfectly empty plates bringing 
grief home overcomes many married seamen deprive captain macw legitimate appetite 
fact steward would almost invariably come sitting captain chair head table say grave murmur captain asks one slice meat two potatoes 
officers could hear moving berth lightly snoring fetching deep sighs splashing blowing bath room made reports keyhole 
crowning achievement amiable character answers got given quite mild friendly tone 
commanders periods seclusion constantly grumpy seem resent mere sound voice injury insult 
grumpy recluse worry subordinates whereas man sense duty strong perhaps sense self importance persists airing deck moroseness day perhaps half night becomes grievous infliction 
walks poop darting gloomy glances though wished poison sea snaps head savagely whenever happen blunder within earshot 
vagaries harder bear patiently becomes man officer sailor really good tempered first days voyage 
regrets memories instinctive longing departed idleness instinctive hate work 
besides things knack going wrong start especially matter irritating trifles 
abiding thought whole year less hard life one hardly southern going voyage yesterday sea meant anything less twelvemonth 
yes needed days taking departure ship company shake places soothing deep water ship routine establish beneficent sway 
great doctor sore hearts sore heads ship routine seen soothe least time turbulent spirits 
health peace satisfaction accomplished round day ship life seems close circle within wide ring sea horizon 
borrows certain dignity sameness majestic monotony sea 
loves sea loves also ship routine 
nowhere else upon sea days weeks months fall away quicker past 
seem left astern easily light air bubbles swirls ship wake vanish great silence ship moves sort magical effect 
pass away days weeks months 
nothing gale disturb orderly life ship spell unshaken monotony seems fallen upon voices men broken near prospect landfall 
spirit ship commander stirred strongly 
moved seek seclusion remain hidden inert shut small cabin solace good bodily appetite 
make land spirit ship commander tormented unconquerable restlessness 
seems unable abide many seconds together holy holies captain state room deck gaze ahead straining eyes appointed moment comes nearer 
kept vigorously upon stretch excessive vigilance 
meantime body ship commander enfeebled want appetite least experience though enfeebled perhaps exactly word 
might say rather spiritualized disregard food sleep ordinary comforts sea life 
one two cases known detachment grosser needs existence remain regrettably incomplete matter drink 
two cases properly speaking pathological cases two sea experience 
one two instances craving stimulants developed sheer anxiety assert man seaman like qualities impaired least 
anxious case land made suddenly close wrong bearing thick weather fresh onshore gale 
going speak soon unlucky enough catch captain act hasty cork drawing

quite another case nothing drink poor captain b 
used suffer sick headaches young days every time approaching coast

evidently reluctant take final cross bearings earth departure voyage unknown destination sailor ever undertakes 
nice large sunny room deep easy chair bow window pillows footstool quiet watchful care elderly gentle woman borne five children perhaps lived five full years thirty married life 
also another woman plain black dress quite gray haired sitting erect chair sewing snatched side glances direction uttering single word time call 
even due course carried cup tea nodded silently faintest ghost smile tight set lips

mentioned young commander always ill days making land long passage 
sort sickness used pass first sight familiar landmark 
afterwards added grew older nervousness wore completely observed weary eyes gaze steadily ahead nothing straight line sea sky whatever seaman looking first bound appear 
also seen eyes rest fondly upon faces room upon pictures wall upon familiar objects home whose abiding clear image must flashed often memory times stress anxiety sea 
looking strange landfall taking untroubled mind bearings last departure hard say voyage man returns landfall departure instantaneous merging together one moment supreme final attention

anchor ever raised must let go perfectly obvious truism brings subject degradation sea language daily press country

v first last seaman thoughts much concerned anchors 
much anchor symbol hope heaviest object handle board ship sea usual routine duties 
beginning end every passage marked distinctly work ship anchors

anything done seamanlike way good enough 
yet somehow nothing ever seems go right ship 
tell naturally unhandy 
old man course captain came deck silk hat brown overcoat civil nod us went ashore

anchor emblem hope foul anchor worse fallacious false hopes ever lured men nations sense security 
sense security even warranted bad councillor 
sense like exaggerated feeling well ominous coming madness precedes swift fall disaster 
seaman laboring undue sense security becomes worth hardly half salt 
therefore chief officers one trusted man called b

business getting anchor securing afterwards unduly prolonged made weariness chief mate
