father get although broke suddenly rested head upon hand 
moment squire heard advancing stairs shouting servants came 
thousand pardons dear thousand pardons said entered room well forgive particulars quite unable discover whereabouts certain necessary portion male attire 
colonel quaritch take daughter stop know way perhaps better show candle 
accordingly advanced vestibule turning left led way long passage till reached dining room 
apartment like vestibule oak panelled walls decorated family portraits including curious painting castle destruction time cromwell 
painting executed massive slab oak conceived quaint formal style relieved foreground stags gaze woodeny horses must according rule proportion half large gateway towers 
evidently also older date present house jacobean probably removed present position ruins castle 
however gave good idea ancient seat boisseys de la molles like roundheads made end glory 
dining room commodious though large 
lighted three narrow windows looked upon moat bore considerable air solid comfort 
table made black oak extraordinary solidity weight matched sideboard material apparently date pieces furniture mr de la molle informed guests relics castle 
sideboard placed several pieces old massive plate rudely engraved three falcons arms de la molle family 
one piece indeed ancient salver bore boisseys ragged oak escutcheon pretence showing thereby dated de la molle time henry seventh obtained property marriage boissey heiress 
conversation turned way dinner simple one went old squire piece plate brought harold quaritch examine 
curious said much mr de la molle indeed said wish 
vanished time charles first 
melted suppose said colonel 
odd part 
think 
hidden somewhere know perhaps turned money money hidden 
tell story like soon done dinner 
accordingly servants removed cloth old fashion placed wine upon naked wood squire began tale following substance 
time james de la molle family height prosperity far money goes 
several generations previous representatives family withdrawn active participation public affairs living small expense upon lands time large amassed quantity wealth age might fairly called enormous 
thus sir stephen de la molle grandfather sir james lived time james left son also named stephen sum less twenty three thousand pounds gold 
stephen great miser tradition says trebled sum lifetime 
anyhow died rich croesus abominated alike tenants country side might expected gentleman race fame degraded sir stephen undoubtedly practice usury 
next heir sir james however old spirit de la molles seems revived although sufficiently clear means spendthrift contrary careful man though one maintained station refused soil fingers base dealing pleased uncle 
going court became perhaps account wealth considerable favorite james greatly attached bought baronetcy 
indeed best proof devotion two occasions lent large sums money king never repaid 
accession charles however sir james left court circumstances never quite cleared 
said smarting slight put upon made somewhat brusque demand money lent james 
thereon king sarcastic wit congratulated fact spirit uncle sir stephen de la molle whose name still byword land evidently survived family 
sir james turned white anger bowed without word left court ever return thither 
years passed civil war height 
sir james yet steadily refused take share 
never forgiven insult put upon king like race said never forgave injury never forgot kindness pertinacious man 
therefore would lift finger king cause 
still less would help roundheads hated singular hatred 
time went till last sore pressed charles knowing great wealth influence brought write letter sir james appealing support especially money 
hear said king letter sir james de la molle aforetyme well affected person especially late king sainted father doth stand idle watching growing bloody struggle lifting hand 
way race sprang unless history doth greatly lie hath past ever found side kings striking right 
told also sir james de la molle doth thus place aside blowing neither hot cold sharp words spake heedless jest many year gone 
know true doubting man memory long hereby crave pardon 
estate one grievous peril sorely need aid god man 
therefore heart subject sir james de la molle rebellious us readily credit implore present aid men money last said hath large store letter proof urgent need 
nearly remember words letter written king hand show pretty clearly hardly pressed 
said read sir james forgetting grievance much affected taking paper wrote hastily follows indeed certainly seen letter museum 
liege past speak 
past 
since hath graciously pleased majesty ask mine aid rebels would overthrow throne rest assured majesty command till time enemies discomfited 
hath pleased providence prosper fortunes stored away safe place till times past great sum gold whereof place ten thousand pieces disposal majesty soon safe means provided conveying seeing sooner die great moneys fall hands rebels furtherance wicked cause 
letter went say writer would buckle raise troop horse among tenantry satisfactory arrangements could made conveyance moneys would bring person king 
comes climax story 
messenger captured sir james incautious letter taken boot result within ten days time found closely besieged five hundred roundheads command one colonel playfair 
castle ill provisioned siege end sir james driven sheer starvation surrender 
sooner obtained entry colonel playfair sent prisoner astonishment produced sir james face letter king 
sir james said hive must ask lead us honey 
great moneys whereof talk herein fain would fingering ten thousand pieces gold snugly stored away 
ay answered old sir james hive secret honey shall

die next day next week indeed 
every day brought colonel threat immediate death questioned treasure suffered meanwhile communicate word sign one save officers rebels 
every day refused till last inquisitor patience gave told frankly communicate secret would shot following dawn 
old sir james laughed said shoot might consigned soul devil would enrich treasures asked bible might brought might read therein prepare death 
gave bible left 
next morning dawn file roundheads marched courtyard castle found colonel playfair officers waiting 
sir james last word said roundhead 
reveal treasure lies choose die reveal answered old man

name god adjure sir james let love lucre stand life 
make one last offer 
discover us ten thousand pounds whereof speak writing held letter king shall go free refuse die 
refuse answered 
musqueteers make ready shouted colonel file men stepped forward 
moment came furious squall wind dense cutting rain execution delayed 
presently passed wild light november morning swept sky revealed doomed man kneeling prayer upon sodden turf water running white hair beard 
called stand would continued praying 
shot knees 
well said colonel quaritch rate died like gallant gentleman 
moment knock door servant came 
asked squire 
george please sir said girl says would like see 
confound growled old gentleman always something 
suppose moat farm 
going see janter day 
excuse quaritch daughter tell end story care hear 
join drawing room 
chapter iv end tale soon father gone ida rose suggested colonel quaritch done wine go drawing room accordingly 
room much modern either vestibule dining room air flavor nineteenth century young lady 
little tables draperies photograph frames hundred one knick knacks odds ends means lady taste makes chamber lovely eyes brutal man 
pleasant place look upon drawing room honham castle irregular recesses somewhat faded colors illuminated soft light shaded lamp general air feminine dominion 
harold quaritch man seen much world seen much drawing rooms indeed ladies large 
come way come way avoided 
therefore perhaps susceptible influences brought within reach 
perchance ida gracious presence threw charm upon place added natural attractiveness china bowls lavender rose leaves added perfume air 
anyhow struck rarely seen room conveyed mind strong suggestions refinement gentle rest 
charming room said entered 
glad think answered ida territory arrange 
yes said easy see 
well would like hear end story sir james treasure certainly interests much 
positively fascinates said ida emphasis 
listen tell 
shot old sir james took bible whether colonel playfair ever sent son france clear 
story known historically certain father said asked bible might sent nothing 
son sir edward never lived return england 
father murder estates seized parliamentary party old castle exception gate towers razed ground partly military purposes partly long determined attempt made discover old sir james treasure might thought concealed secret chamber walls 
use colonel playfair found letting temper get better shooting sir james done away chance finding ever likely appearance secret died owner 
great deal noise time colonel degraded rank reward done 
presumed old sir james must accomplices hiding great mass gold every means taken way threats promises reward last grew half total amount discovered induce come forward existed without result 
matter went till years quest died away forgotten 
meanwhile son sir edward second last baronet led wandering life abroad fearing caring return england property seized 
two twenty years age however contracted imprudent marriage cousin lady name ida dofferleigh girl good blood great beauty without means 
indeed sister geoffrey dofferleigh first cousin companion exile sir edward presently see lineal ancestor 
well within year marriage poor ida namesake died baby fever chiefly brought say want anxiety mind shock seems turned husband brain 
rate within three four months death committed suicide 
formally executed rather elaborate left estates england unjustly withheld contrary law natural right rebel pretender cromwell together treasure hidden thereon elsewhere late murdered father sir james de la molle john geoffrey dofferleigh cousin brother late wife heirs ever condition assuming name arms de la molle family direct line became extinct 
course executed appearance much waste paper within three years date charles ii 
king england 
thereon geoffrey dofferleigh produced document assuming name arms de la molle actually succeeded obtaining remains castle considerable portion landed property though baronetcy became extinct 
son built present house direct ancestor though father talks though little weakness old de la molles direct male ancestors 
well said harold dofferleigh find treasure ah anybody else treasure vanished 
hunted great deal find pieces plate saw night hidden away somewhere know nothing else

years puzzled thinking might form acrostic make nothing 
tried ways 
translated french translated latin still find nothing nothing 
day somebody hit upon least hope

chapter ix shadow ruin mr quest walked vestry meeting smile upon thin gentlemanly looking face rage bitterness heart 
caught time said good deal way deceit keep blood cheeks hears fellow name 
clever woman belle well managed little business luncheon well fought case got cleft stick edith money made good terms 
ah worst whip hand could ruin could ruin use cutting one nose spite face 
well fine lady went ominous flash gray eyes shall even yet 
give enough rope hang 
love fellow know go hard make break heart 
bah know sort stuff men made 
happen love care 
ah church 
human animal complicated machine conduct working extraordinary number different interests sets ideas almost entirely simultaneously 
instance mr quest seated right hand rector vestry room beautiful old boisingham church engaged animated even warm discussion senior curate details fourteenth century church work clearly took lively interest understood far better curate would exceedingly difficult identify scheming vindictive creature followed church path 
way human nature although may way try draw love paint villain black evil one virtuous heroine radiant begin fancy hear whispering wings 
people altogether good altogether bad indeed probable vast majority neither good bad strength one 
however meet spirit sufficient originality press scale way though even opposing force good evil constantly striving bring balance equal 
even wicked men redeeming points righteous instincts thoughts continually fixed upon iniquity 
mr quest instance one evil geniuses history plots passions immediately concerned man eminently generous refined tendencies 
many good turns contradictory may seem done poorer neighbors even known forego bills costs highest rarest exhibition earthly virtue expected lawyer 
moreover eminently cultured man reader classics translations originals man fine taste fiction poetry really sound ripe archaeological knowledge especially sacred buildings concerned 
instincts also towards respectability 
burning ambition secure high position county lived classed among resident gentry 
hated lawyer work longed accumulate sufficient means able give good bye indulge existence luxurious learned leisure 
made son poor inferior country dentist begun life good education true chiefly owed exertions nothing else 
nature temperate nature balance good credit draw upon instead balance evil man might gone far indeed addition natural ability great power work 
unfortunately case instincts whole evil instincts passions whether hate love greed seized extraordinary violence rendering time utterly callous rights feelings others provided attained end 
short born good position large fortune quite possible providing always strong passions period life led irremediably astray would lived virtuous respected died good odour leaving behind happy memory 
fate placed antagonism world yet endowed gnawing desire world appeared desirable complete ruin circumstances thrown temptations inexperience headlong strength passions gave opportunity escape 
may first appear strange man calculating whose desires seemed fixed upon material end acquirement artifice even fraud wealth coveted also nourish heart bitter hatred keen thirst revenge upon woman mr quest undoubtedly towards beautiful wife 
would seemed probable would left heroics alone attempted turn wife folly means wealth self advancement would doubt mrs quest estimate motives marrying entirely correct one 
told edward cossey remembered husband married money ten thousand pounds stood badly need 
truth certain extent certain extent 
wanted ten thousand pounds fact moment money necessary 
wife never known realized still also love 
possibly ten thousand pounds would proved sufficient inducement without love love none less 
relations however never happy ones 
detested fist spared say 
man refinement whatever lacked mr quest refinement could bear thus continually repulsed woman came pass intercourse always strained nature 
last obtained clue secret life threat exposure drove bargain terms complete separation outward form virtual freedom action 
considering position perhaps justified husband never forgave 
determined means possible turn passion although know perfectly aware bore towards business superior edward cossey refined instrument vengeance success one purposes history show 
put briefly possible outlines character aims remarkable contradictory man 
within hour half leaving house oaks called although trees named long since vanished garden mr quest bowling swiftly along behind edward cossey powerful bay horse towards towering gateway honham castle 
within three hundred yards idea struck pulled horse sharply alone dogcart paused admire view 
beautiful place reflected enthusiasm grandly old towers stand sky 
squire restored well doubt could done better 
wonder place ever mine 
things look black may come round think beginning see way 
started horse reflecting unpleasant nature business 
personally liked respected old squire certainly pitied though would dreamed allowing liking pity interfere prosecution schemes ardent sportsman would dream shooting pheasants happened take friendly interest nurture 
also certain gentlemanlike distaste bearer crushing bad news mr quest disliked scenes possibly intimate personal acquaintance 
whilst still wondering might best deal matter passed moat ancient gateway admired fervently found front hall door 
pulled looking somebody take horse suddenly squire emerged upon rush 
hullo quest shouted though visitor fifty yards instead five 
looking 
william william crescendo william fortissimo earth boy expect idle fellow george sending errands instead attending 
whenever wanted take horse nowhere found please sir mr george calls please sir mr george sent moat farm somewhere see many eggs hens laid last week something sort 
nice horse got way nice indeed 
horse mr de la molle said lawyer faint smile mr edward cossey oh mr edward cossey answered old gentleman sudden change voice 
ah mr edward cossey well good horse anyhow suppose mr cossey afford buy good horses 
faint cry coming sir coming heard long hobble de hoy kind youth whose business look extensive castle stables emerged great heat round corner house 
earth began squire stentorian tone 
please sir mr george tell broke squire 
told time time mind business leave mr george mind take horse round stables see properly fed 
come quest come 
quarter hour luncheon get business led way passage tapestried panelled vestibule took stand empty fireplace 
mr quest followed stopping ostensibly admire particularly fine suit armor hung upon wall really gain another moment reflection 
beautiful suit early stuart period mr de la molle said never saw better 
yes yes belonged old sir james one roundheads shot 
sir james hid treasure yes 
telling story new neighbor colonel quaritch last night nice fellow way go call upon 
wonder said mr quest 
ah many another dare say 
wish could find sure 
wanted badly enough days 
reminds quest 
gathered difficulty note george told 
see man janter thanks confounded fellow major boston action college lands thrown moat farm george tells another tenant love money 
fact know one get tenants days simply 
well circumstances course one thing done know take farm hand farm 
quite impossible let place fall cultivation would happen otherwise lay grass would cost considerable sum seven eight years got return 
squire paused mr quest said nothing 
well went next thing obtain necessary cash pay janter valuation stock place four thousand would perhaps added access generous confidence better say five 
fifty acres low lying meadows want thoroughly bush drained bushes quite good pipes stiff land put right sort stuff cost half much still done nothing new wagon shed wanted odds ends yes better say five thousand 
still mr quest made answer squire went 
well see circumstances able lay hands upon necessary capital private resources course made mind apply cossey son loan 
indeed considering long intimate connection house de la molle family think right proper indeed consider wrong neglected give opportunity investment faint smile flickered instant mr quest face went course matter business require security properly estate unentailed fortunately little difficulty 
draw necessary deeds think circumstances right thing would charge moat farm specifically amount 
things bad enough doubt hardly suppose possible conceivable circumstances farm would good five thousand pounds 
however might perhaps prefer general clause well although consider quite unnecessary shall raise objection course 
last mr quest broke somewhat ominous silence 
sorry say mr de la molle said gently hold prospect cossey son induced circumstances advance another pound upon security honham castle estates 
opinion value landed property security received severe shock comfortable safety amount already invested 
mr de la molle started heard unexpected bit news totally unprepared 
always found possible borrow money never occurred time might perhaps come country land held almost superstitious veneration would valueless form property lenders would refuse security 
said recovering total encumbrances property amount twenty five thousand pounds succeeded father forty years ago valued fifty castle premises thoroughly repaired since cost five thousand farm buildings 
possibly de la molle honest much doubt honham castle lands round would fetch twenty five thousand pounds forced sale 
competition radical agitation brought estates people realize land australia new zealand worth almost much per acre cultivated lands england 
perhaps residential property account historical interest might fetch doubt 
short mr de la molle anxious cossey son matter regret tell far willing make advance firm formally instructed serve usual six months notice calling money already advanced mortgage together interest must remind nearly year overdue step propose take morrow 
old gentleman staggered moment caught mantelpiece blow heavy one unexpected heavy 
recovered instant one peculiarities character spirits always seemed rise occasion face urgent adversity short possessed extraordinary share moral courage 
indeed said indignantly indeed pity tell mr quest would saved putting false position proposing business arrangement acceptable 
regards interest admit say much regret 
stupid fellow george always dreadfully behindhand accounts never get anything settled 
state indeed know reason unfortunate george behindhand accounts make rather wrong side ledger 
matter seen 
course business people quite right consider due blame messrs cossey matter least 
still must say considering long intimate relationship nearly two centuries existed house family might well shown little consideration 
yes said mr quest daresay step strikes harsh one 
perfectly frank mr de la molle struck harsh one course servant bound carry instructions 
sympathise much much indeed 
oh said old gentleman 
course arrangements must made much pain terminate connection messrs cossey shall made 
think went lawyer without notice interruption misunderstand matter little 
cossey son trading corporation whose object make money lending otherwise hazards make money 
kind feeling allude might induce consideration long intimacy close connection past forego opportunity even run risk loss thing belongs former generations 
present strictly commercial age commercial trading nations 
cossey son move times would rather sell dozen families dealt two centuries lose five hundred pounds provided course could without scandal loss public respect banking house concerned also means loss custom 
great lover past believe ancestors ways business whole better charitable make living take world find mr de la molle 
quite quest quite answered squire quietly 
idea looked matters light 
certainly world changed good deal since young man think changed much better 
want luncheon hungry work talking foreclosures 
mr quest used unpleasant word squire seen drift 
come next room led way drawing room ida sitting reading times

well old man hope shall live see 
ida 
poor ida bear think old place generations generations chapter x tennis party ida shook hands coldly enough lawyer cherished dislike unmixed fear 
many women nature gifted extraordinary power intuition fully makes deficiency reasoning force 
conclude premisses observation know man feared trusted 
fact share rest breathing creation self protective instinct instantaneous almost automatic judgment given guard dangers continually threatened hands man mastering strength ordered intelligence 
ida one 
knew nothing mr quest disadvantage indeed always heard spoken great respect curiously enough liked wife 
could bear man feeling heart avoided account hidden qualities moreover active personal enemy 
went dining room luncheon set ida allowed mr quest cut cold boiled beef operation seem much home came rapid conclusion mind 
seen clearly enough father face interview lawyer serious character knew chances would never able get upshot old gentleman curious habit keeping unpleasant matters absolutely forced circumstances reveal 
also knew father affairs critical condition extracted previous night remedy attempted must attempted heroic scale 
therefore made mind ask bete noire mr quest truth might 
mr quest said trepidation last triumphantly handed beef hope forgive asking plain question favor plain answer 
know father affairs much involved anxious borrow money know quite matters stand want learn exact truth 
glad hear speak miss de la molle answered lawyer trying make mind broach subject painful one 
frankly forgive saying father absolutely ruined 
interest mortgages year arrear largest farm thrown upon hands complete tale mortgagees going call money foreclose 
statement almost brutal brief comprehensiveness ida turned pale death well might dropped fork clatter upon plate 
realize things quite bad murmured 
suppose place taken us shall shall go away 
yes certainly unless money found take mortgages see chance 
place sold fetch days great sum 
asked 
six nine months time 
ida lips trembled sight food upon plate became nauseous 
vision arose mind eye old father departing hand hand castle gates behind gleamed hard wild lights march sunset seek place hide 
vivid horror phantasy almost overcame 
way escape asked hoarsely 
lose place would kill father 
loves better anything world whole life wrapped 
quite understand miss de la molle charming old place especially anybody interested past 
unfortunately mortgagees respecters feelings 
land much property nothing 
know said impatiently answer question leaned towards resting hand upon table 
way mr quest drank little claret answered 
yes said think take

beauty though presence many women beautiful even plain 
spring native grace tact alone though things must present 
rather perhaps reflection cultivated intellect acting upon naturally pure elevated temperament makes ladies conspicuous fashions kind men putting aside mere charm beauty natural softening judgment atmosphere sex must recognize equal mind presence noble

chapter xiii art edward cossey drove castle far happy frame mind 
begin squire condescending way business irritated much much twice course conversation within ace breaking whole thing restrained difficulty 
notwithstanding sacrifices money risks undergoing take mortgages considerable even man great prospects felt placed position person receives favor rather person grants one 
moreover assumption superiority old man visible recognition gulf used fixed gentleman family man business grown rich trading money money worth galling founded actual fact edward cossey knew 
foibles oddities notwithstanding would impossible person discernment entertain comparison half ruined squire young banker would shortly worth half million million sterling 
former representative though somewhat erratic one best old type englishmen gentle blood rapidly vanishing class large extent country owes greatness

violent unreasoning passion wearied alarmed never knew would next kept continual condition anxiety irritation morrow might bring forth 
sure unaltering attachment pretext jealousy found exceedingly irksome obliged avoid giving cause side however dreaded lest thereby bring overwhelming catastrophe 
mrs quest well knew woman would pause consider consequences passionate jealousy really aroused 
even doubtful certainty ruin would check 
love everything life thing lived rather tamely lose seemed extremely probable edward cossey would hesitate face shame even death 
indeed great passion could hope influence 
could persuade release pointing continuance intrigue must involve ruin sort might yet go well

little weakness think could paint one somewhat tenacious 
like many another man could number things exceedingly well one thing badly yet faith bad thing good 
strange say although affected believe firmly style art hold ida cheap regard little painting latter valued oftenest put upon easel purposes solitary admiration

tree blot brown color altogether though matter fact clever thing enough point view art utterly anathema 
little picture oils faintly shadowed sitting easel working soft gray autumn evening ida painted given admired much 
speak truth friend colonel going going fast sinking sight former self depths love possessed soul 
simple pure minded man 
strange may appear since first unhappy business youth never heard speak living woman anything 
therefore instead becoming vulgarised hardened association odds ends womankind man traveling globe comes contact generally greatly improvement faith found time grow stronger even first 
looked upon woman young man looks bitter experience world venerated almost worshipped something better brighter purer hardly worn like jewel prized value beauty 
dangerous state mind man three four forty fall soft state world softest apt get worst

harold quaritch long interval set eyes upon ida face felt curious change come 
vague ideas less poetical aspirations five long years gathered memory took shape form heart knew loved 
days went came know better grew love till last whole heart went towards late found treasure became life aught else could 
serene happy days spent painting talking wandered honham castle grounds 
degrees ida slight perceptible hardness manner wore away stood one sweetest natural women england woman brains force character 
soon harold discovered life anything easy one 
constant anxiety money father affairs worn hardened till said began feel though heart left 
heard trouble dead brother james dearly loved sore trouble extravagant ways continual demands money met somehow 
last came crushing blow death certainty extinction male line de la molles said believed father would never hold head 
vitality equal shock time debts began come although legally bound father would insist upon meeting last farthing honor family respect son memory 
increased money troubles gone always getting worse agricultural depression deepened till things reached present position 
told bit bit keeping back last development drama part edward cossey played sad enough made think ancient house de la molle vanishing night ruin 
also told something life companionless since brother went army real friends honham even acquaintance tastes without gushingly decidedly artistic intellectual 
wished said try something world

besides ida society charms colonel quaritch society almost quite much charm 
may remembered night first met spoken kind man would like marry 
thought passing one may safely said since entertained serious idea marriage connection colonel quaritch 
person seemed slightest probability marrying edward cossey mere thought enough make whole idea matrimony repugnant 
notwithstanding day day found harold quaritch society congenial

beneath somewhat rugged unpromising exterior harold quaritch hid vein considerable richness 
associated would believed man side nature almost poetic ripe finished scholar devoid certain dry humor 
traveled far seen much men manners gathering sorts quaint odds ends information 
perhaps rather accomplishments man transparent honesty simple mindedness love true noble contempt mean base unwittingly peeping conversation attracted rest 
ida young girl caught handsome face dazzled superficial show mind 
thoughtful ripened woman quick perceive rare talent judgment wherewith weigh proceeds perception 
plain middle aged colonel quaritch found perfect gentleman valued accordingly 
day grew day lovely autumn tide 
edward cossey away london quest ceased troubling journeying together sweet shadows companionship slow sure degrees drew near sunlit plain love

liked colonel quaritch thought would good thing ida get married though idea parting troubled heart sorely 
whether would desirable point view marry colonel matter yet fully made mind

life indeed full miseries keenly felt high pitch capacity nature perhaps sharpest sickening knowledge one fatal error boyhood one false step steep avernus might good even great man 
however load little lightened able devote money making weaving web destroy rival edward cossey mind little less preoccupied cares 
meanwhile things castle going pleasantly everybody 
squire happy attending various details connected transfer mortgages though lending thirty thousand pounds instead borrowing

put dress clothes come dinner intention proposing ida taking went bed 
love deep enough steady enough perhaps possess wild impetuosity carries people far youth sometimes indeed great deal reason approves 
essentially middle aged devotion bore resemblance picturesque passion five twenty snow fed torrent navigable river

life wrapped feel though see could never happy man paused looked anxiously face set drawn though pain 
say yes colonel quaritch answered length tone puzzled tender unfitted words

moment harold quaritch looked bewildered least understanding ida meant followed impulse common mankind similar circumstances took arms 
resent movement indeed scarcely seemed notice though tell truth moment two colonel seemed happiest life head rested shoulder 
almost instantly however raised freed embrace ceased weeping 
told much said suppose better tell everything 
know whatever temptation laid great stress upon words conceivable circumstances indeed even believed serving rely upon never reveal anybody father tell paused looked eyes tears still swam

went 
drawing room found squire puzzling sheet paper scrawled george accounts figures first sight bore much resemblance egyptian hieroglyphics use day 
hullo said 
earth looking castle moonlight answered ida coolly 
beautiful 
um ah said squire dryly doubt beautiful grass rather damp well look held sheet hieroglyphics perhaps add ida 
george bought stock sorts things sale day account three hundred seventy two pounds makes make four hundred twenty hang find right 
important accounts kept straight 
important get stupid fellow 
ida took sheet paper added result discovered totals wrong 
harold watching wondered nerve woman going scene occurred could deliberately add long rows badly written figures 
money father expending cheerfully part price bound 
sigh rose said good night went home feelings almost mixed admit accurate description 
taken great step life certain extent step succeeded 
altogether built hopes upon sand ida said still tacitly admitted necessarily clear less regard man would wish regarded woman dearly loved 
great deal indeed dared believe usually case imperfect world things often seem carefully arranged sixes sevens came side shield 
use sweet woman love use put pure water happiness lips desert lonely life see cup held shattered blow story money loan consideration ida put pawn egyptians used put mummies fathers pawn almost incredible 
person simple honorable nature seemed preposterous unheard thing man calling gentleman find possible sink low take advantage woman dire necessity honorable desire save father misery race ruin extract promise marriage consideration value received 
putting aside overwhelming personal interest matter made blood boil think thing could 
yet believed knew ida well enough convinced would shirk bargain 
edward cossey came forward claim bond would paid last farthing 
question thirty thousand pounds happiness life ida depended upon sum money 
money forthcoming cossey could claim flesh blood 
come worth perhaps ten thousand pounds commutation value pension possibly twelve means raising farthing 
thought position till tired thinking heavy heart yet strange glow happiness shining grief like sunlight gray sky last went sleep dreamed ida gone utterly alone world 
cause trouble much ida poor woman somewhat cold stately exterior lay deep times passionate nature 
weeks growing strangely attracted harold quaritch knew loved one thing desired wide world become wife 
yet bound bound sense honor sense money received stay beck call man detested time pleased throw handkerchief pick hold breast 
bad enough hanging head less passive condition therefore certain extent reckless future heart alight holy flame good woman love whole nature rebelled cried aloud sacrilege involved revolting terrible 
yet far could see great probability escape 
shrewd observant woman could gauge mr cossey condition mind towards less accuracy 
also think least likely spent thirty thousand pounds advance object would content let advantage drop 
course would repellent trading instincts 
knew heart hour far would claim unless accident occurred prevent practically certain would called upon fulfil pledge whilst loving another man become wife edward cossey

chapter xxxvii sister agnes ten days passed 
tragedy echoed land 
numberless articles paragraphs written numberless papers numberless theories built upon 
echoes already beginning die away

made parcel sent edward cossey together formal note explanation greatly wondering heart course would take reference 
left long doubt 
receipt deeds acknowledged three days afterwards heard notice calling borrowed money served upon mr de la molle behalf edward cossey 
evidently made mind forego new advantage chance threw way 
pressure pressure alone could enable attain end applying unmercifully 
well done matter could help faintly wondering extraordinary tenacity hardness purpose action showed 
turned mind consideration another matter connection plans approaching maturity 
days exactly fortnight date mr quest death edward cossey sitting one afternoon brooding fire rooms 
much business awaiting attention london would go london 
could tear away boisingham matters could attended left without attention 
still determined ever marry ida determined possible constant brooding matter arrived condition approaching monomania 
quick see advantage resulting mr quest tragic death return deeds though knew ida would hate instructed lawyers call money make use every possible legal means harass put pressure upon mr de la molle 
time written privately squire calling attention fact matters beginning willing carry arrangements already specified provided ida could persuaded consent marry 
mr de la molle answered courteously enough notwithstanding grief irritation course would son law taken mortgages death mr quest suspicion nothing original cause transfer lawyer 
said said could force daughter marriage chose agree offer objection 
matter stood 
twice edward met ida walking driving 
bowed coldly 
indeed one crumb comfort daily bread disappointment hope deferred lady concerned makes heart normally sick knew hated rival colonel quaritch forbidden castle intercourse ida practically end 
dogged persevering man knew power money shifts people driven made desperate want 
knew rare thing women attached one man sell another free realizing love may pass wealth settlements properly drawn 
therefore still hoped many circumstances bringing ever increasing pressure upon ida spirit would time broken resistance would collapse would 
sequel show hope baseless one 
infatuation literally limit
