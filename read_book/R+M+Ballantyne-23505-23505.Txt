one moment thought occurred old become salmon fisher would able fight battle 
quite mistaken 
every minute seemed gain fresh strength 
salmon happily took head cease antics half minute fisher worst 
half minute breathing space wanted 
geo ge hah cut wata george could make agitated parent wanted 
water water chokin reiterated father 
oh right george scooped quantity water leathern cup ran choking sire holding rod tight hands turned head aside stretched left arm still however keeping eyes fixed line 
lips 
lips projected george raised cup salmon moved moment draught postponed 
fish came another pause soon 
geo ge try gain 
lips projected cup raised salmon seemed know going cup lips met went unusually fierce run river 
cup contents knocked george face george knocked father sprang bank ran along dry patch gravel extended tail pool 
hitherto battle fought within limits one large pool fish seemed objection quit 
changed tactics began descend river tail foremost slowly steadily 
round face fisher time blazing red eager hope beclouded shade anxiety 
let go rapids father said george never get past thick bushes overhang bank 
mr sudberry stopped held till rod bent like giant hoop line became rigid fish checked 
retrograde movement slow steady irresistible 
smash everything cried fred 
mr sudberry constrained follow step step 
head rapid gained increase pace quick walk still farther walk became smart run 
ground rugged fisher actions became quite acrobatic 
george fred kept higher bank ran along gazing unspeakable amazement bounds leaps fat little sire made agility roe deer 
hold bushes let break mr sudberry scorned advice 
part bank impassable river rushed past like mill race 
tried stop fish failed course deliberately walked water 
waist deep carried like cork toes touching ground lightly first time life rejoiced sensations hitherto believed belonged exclusively harlequins columbines namely swift motion without effort fifty yards rate ten miles hour brought eddy salmon dashed 
mr sudberry gave vent another roar beheld fish almost nose 
startled creature flashed sight swept across stream several times besides throwing one two somersaults air recovered equanimity 
bolted deep dark pool remained quite motionless 
mr sudberry much puzzled point 
let line fish ran across stream wind fish stopped follow fish went stream principles taught experience trout fishing act fish would move could made move lesson yet learn 
done said look exasperation wonder experienced hour quarter rough treatment getting fagged 
pull hole suggested george 
try 
mr sudberry tried failed 
failed sat stone still holding rod tight wiped heated brow 
starting tried next ten minutes pull fish hole main force course never venturing pull hard break line 
went stream pulled stream pulled even waded across stream shallow part pulled vain 
fish condition fishers term sulks 
last fred recollected heard hector macdonald say cases stone thrown pool sometimes effect starting sulky one 
accordingly stone thrown result fish came full speed horrible fright went stream tail head foremost 
salmon knows instinct go faster stream water force gills drown therefore goes head first seldom except way sea goes full speed fisher chance saving fish run fast hope may pause accord opportune eddy 
fine open space bank enabled mr sudberry run like deer fish nigh quarter mile end burst drew near falls succession small cataracts rapids seemed impossible fisher go without breaking neck losing fish 
george fred roared hold mr sudberry glanced falls frowned compressed lips 
felt resolved beat went fish went right first fall fisher leaped ledge rock three feet high scrambled across rough ground pulled eddy fish seemed disposed rest 
gratified seeing fish turn white side thus showing symptoms exhaustion 
recovered went another fall 
stopped george fred feeling convinced father gone mad threw coats ran foot fall ready plunge stream rescue fate thought saw impending 
fate awaited daring man 
succeeded drawing fish close gravelly shallow gave exhausted wallop two lay side 
george came leaping water tried kick 
missed kick fell 
fred dashed also missed 
mr sudberry rushed forward gave salmon kick sent high dry bank fell george tripped fred three instantly soaked skin returned bank without hats 
mr sudberry flung conquered fish held fast george fred cheered danced round triumphant joy 
thus mr sudberry landed first last salmon ten pounder thus brilliantly terminated three months rustication highlands 
end whole affair means 
mr sudberry family returned london took salmon 
dinner party choice friends hastily got honor superb fish occasion fred father well nigh quarrelled point caught salmon mr sudberry insisting man hooked fish real catcher fred scouting ridiculous notion asserting played landed entitled honor 
point settled however incomprehensible way without self denying disputants coming blows everyone agreed sight best salmon ever eaten london
