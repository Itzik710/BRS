first consider wonderful words text god covers light garment 
truly something divine light seems especial pattern likeness god 
bible uses continually 
light pattern god wisdom light sees everything searches everything light pattern god revelation light shows us everything without light eyes would useless without god soul eyes would useless 
god teaches us know 
god makes us understand understand

thus light god garment 
shows us yet hides us 
could dare bear look god saw face face souls would dazzled blind eyes sun noonday 
light pattern us god glory therefore written light god garment god dwells light man approach unto 
wise old heathen nobly said light shadow god text says stretches glorious blue heavens us curtain shield hide eyes unutterable splendor yet lift souls 
vastness beauty heavens countless stars one sun world teach us small great father made 
see curtain know bides something beautiful behind curiosity wonder awakened long see behind curtain 
glory skies ought make us wonder long see god made skies 
psalmist says god lays beams chambers waters makes clouds chariot walks upon wings wind makes angels storms ministers flaming fire 
must suppose psalmist poor notion great infinite god fancy could one place 
god wants chambers even though built clouds arched rainbows wide whole vault heaven 
wants wind carry carries things moves things 
live move 
yet heaven heaven heavens contain everywhere spirit things yet thing things things consist 
absolute uncreated infinite one
