mrs polk strict religious practice imagine taken somewhat finesse get consent festivities 
called sometimes diplomats ball 
least diplomacy back 
mere accident set celebration upon evening battle palo alto may eighth 
ten clock many great room made ready dancing rather brave company might called 
least splendor foreign diplomats uniforms background added bravest attire one individual fashion fear 
thus friend jack dandridge wholly resplendent new waistcoat devising evening coat almost swept floor executed evolutions western style dancing 
gentlemen perhaps grave staid 
us least one man old government service dared silk stockings knee breeches earlier generation 
yet another wore white powdered queue might suited grandfather 
younger men day wore hair long fashion quite different yet detract distinction faces one might seen among sleep soon upturned moon another yet bitter war aftermath mexico 
tall stock still evidence time ruffled shirts gave something formal old fashioned touch assembly 
somewhat varied uninteresting attire best washington present

later came fields monterey buena vista cerro gordo contreras cherubusco molino del rey last guns sounded gate old city mexico 
fighting saw much time employed manner special work engaged last years 
mr calhoun agency reached certain importance matters chosen commissioner negotiate peace mexico 
honor later proved dangerous questionable one 
general scott wanted interference kind especially since knew mr calhoun influence choice 
thwarted attempts reach headquarters enemy everything could secure peace mouth cannon 
could offer terms better mr buchanan secretary state prepared rejected mexican government last 
ordered mr polk state better terms offer told return washington 
time could make way lines truth much care 
certain event written history influenced remain time little village guadalupe hidalgo 
short received word lady formerly known none less se ora yturrio member mexican legation washington 
true record reached influential position country using methods 
told pay attention reported mexico 
fact approached mexican commissioners introduced done history 
signed peace guadalupe hidalgo accordance terms originally given secretary state 
calhoun kindness woman distress lost unwittingly helped ending war never wished begun 
meantime recalled washington know nature recall 
last arrived found disgraced discredited 
actions repudiated administration 
dismissed service without pay sad enough blow young man married less year 
mr polk jealousy john calhoun cause 
calhoun prophecy right 
polk forget revenge 
yet none less usual fashion averse receiving credit could 
put responsibility treaty upon senate debated hotly weeks last much surprise gratification ratified north opposed mexican war war later led inevitably war rebellion found unable say much great additions domain treaty secured 
paid fifteen millions addition territorial indemnity claim got realm whose wealth could computed 
much must owned fortune singular favorite mr polk 
curiously enough smoke hardly cleared palo alto field abraham lincoln young member house congress introducing resolution asked marking spot outrage committed 
perhaps outrage 
many still hold 
let us reflect would lincoln life matters gone 
cessions mexico came great domain california 
look strangely history sometimes works 
suspicion discovery gold california neither mexico republic ever would owned england surely would taken 
year treaty eventually ratified gold discovered california late england interfere late also mexico claim 
got untold millions treasure 
millions went northern states manufactures commerce 
north owned gold gold gave north power crush rebellion born mexican war rebellion england late would gladly seen union disrupted might yet another chance lands lost ever 
fate seemed still us often occasion believe may possible thing 
war conquest mr calhoun opposed war grew slavery tenets held great error otherwise splendid public life found correction civil war 
gold california put slavery 
thenceforth slavery existed legally north mason dixon line problems yet 
perhaps war may come settle 
fortunate us could another california another texas another oregon help us pay intimately connected many less known matters claim master reputation wholly different given garbled history life 
lay claim name foresight beyond man time 
made mistakes made bravely grandly consistently 
convictions enlisted reservations used every means every available weapon shown 
never self seeking never cheap never insincere 
detester machine politicians statesman worthy called william pitt united states 
consistency career marvelous thing though changed beliefs first recognize changing conditions country 
failed execrated 
forgot 
chief mr calhoun die six years first evening doctor ward talk 
said died disease lungs yet history curiously mistaken 
mr calhoun slept away 
sometimes think shudder perhaps revenge nemesis took mistakes 
last days dreamlike passing 
last speech senate read one friends doctor ward advised 
said afterwards illness accursed sleeping sickness imported africa slaves strange thing john calhoun indeed died error least slept away 
least made atonement 
south following doctrines long accursed sleeping sickness providence god lost us long splendid history 
john calhoun grave somber figure history got vast land texas 
also clay jackson northern statesmen never could see future west got vast northwest realm 
within days palo alto ball memorandum agreement signed minister pakenham mr buchanan secretary state 
done instance aid john calhoun 
helena von ritz brought treaty june fifteenth year signed gladly signed minister great britain 
latter fully enough impressed story reports columns west bound farmers rifles leaning wagon seats plows lashed tail gates 
calhoun never ceased regret could delay year two years longer 
thwarted impetuous war republic south although never fought lost california lost also south lost union one form one name government another flag democracy eventually must float continent 
part country must must people may cost blood treasure 
time shall see wisdom john calhoun time think shall see come true prophecy strange brilliant mentality calhoun presence mine said northern lands mexico well must one day say people sake human opportunity human hope happiness
