archie loved books pleased mother time often hung heavy hands mind devoting two three hours day tasks set 
times fished stream wandered hills brought herbs dame forbes distilled potions distributed villagers sick

respect indeed archie needed stimulant 
sandy even mother heard brave father deeds arms although way repressed utterances said little mother resolved much could wish would day win back patrimony avenge father upon slayers 
consequently upon every opportunity sandy grahame could spare time multifarious work archie practiced sword pike

time story opens springtime year playing ball village lads green party horsemen seen approaching 
head rode two men perhaps forty years old lad eighteen years age rode beside 
one elder men archie recognized sir john kerr 
lad beside son allan

evening archie said mother mother english knight today saw ride past kerr governor scottish town lanark may well wonder archie many scotland older years marvel scotsmen always free tolerate strange thing 
long story tangled one tomorrow morning draw genealogy various claimants scottish throne see thing come pretence edward england planted garrisons free scotland 
next morning archie forget remind mother promise 
must know began good king alexander three children david died boy alexander married daughter count flanders died childless daughter margaret married eric young king norway 
three years ago queen norway died leaving daughter also named margaret called among us maid norway mother death became heir presumptive throne recognized assembly estates scone 
hoped king would male heirs early last year still prime life married joleta daughter count drew 
unhappily th march attended council castle edinburgh way back wife kinghorn stormy night fell precipice killed 
hopes country rested maid norway alone stood throne number claimants would prepared support claims arms thus bring unnumbered woes upon scotland 
unhappily country maid died voyage scotland succession therefore became open 
see chart drawn lines principal competitors nigh upon score claimed throne 
death maid king edward proposed marriage young son ambassadors met scottish commissioners brigham near kelso th july treaty concluded 
contained besides provisions marriage clauses personal freedom margaret survive husband reversion crown failing issue protection rights laws liberties scotland freedom church privileges crown vassals independence courts preservation charters natural muniments holding parliaments within scotland specially provided vassal compelled go forth scotland purpose performing homage fealty native scotland cause whatever compelled answer breach covenant crime committed kingdom 
thus see boy king edward time fully recognized perfect independence scotland raised claim suzerainty 
indeed article stipulated rights laws liberties customs scotland remain ever entire inviolable throughout whole realm marches article v kingdom scotland shall remain separate divided england free without subjection according right boundaries marches heretofore 
king edward however artfully inserted salvo saving rights king england others date treaty belong marches elsewhere 
scottish lords raised objection insertion salvo seeing general purport edward possessed rights scotland ever asserted predecessors scotland kingdom equal neighbor neither william norman successors attempted set forward claims authority beyond border 
sooner treaty signed edward without warrant excuse appointed anthony beck warlike bishop durham lieutenant scotland name yet unmarried pair finding resented demanded places strength kingdom delivered 
demand however complied matter still pending maid norway died 
three principal competitors bruce baliol comyn friends began arm william fraser bishop st andrews friend baliol wrote king edward suggesting act arbitrator hinting chose baliol would find submissive things wishes 
edward jumped proposal thereupon issued summonses barons northern counties meet norham june mandate issued sheriffs northumberland cumberland westmoreland york lancaster assemble feudal array rendezvous 
know son owing marriages royal families england scotland close connection countries 
many scotch barons married english heiresses hold lands countries scottish maidens married english knights 
thus happens great number scotch nobility much englishmen scotchmen vassals england lands held 
four competitors john baliol robert bruce john comyn william ross barons england well scotland lands lying north course included invitation 
may edward issued invitation bishops st andrews glasgow scotch nobles come norham remain return specially saying presence regarded custom laws scotland might future time prejudiced 
hither came whole power north england many scotch nobles 
court opened roger brabazon king justiciary delivered address stated edward lord paramount scotland come administer justice competitors crown concluded request present acknowledge claim lord paramount 
scottish nobles present exception privy edward designs filled astonishment dismay pretension declared ignorance claim superiority king england scotland 
king passion exclaimed holy edward whose crown wear vindicate rights perish attempt 
however saw nothing could done instant adjourned meeting three weeks end time prelates nobles community scotland invited bring forward whatever could opposition claim supremacy 
time fixed scotch nobles met time scottish side border edward gathered together whole force northern counties 
besides four claimants whose names told sir john hastings patrick dunbar earl march william de vesci robert de pinkeny nicholas de soulis patrick galythly roger de mandeville florence count holland eric king norway 
exception eric count holland dunbar galythly norman extraction held possessions england 
meeting opened prelates nobles present advanced nothing disprove edward claim supremacy 
representatives commons however show reason claim indeed son every man scotland knows shadow foundation 
king chancellor declared nothing objections edward claim therefore resolved lord paramount determine question succession 
various competitors asked whether acknowledged edward lord paramount willing receive judgment whole wretched traitors proceeded barter country hopes crown acknowledged edward lord paramount left judgment hands 
bruce baliol received handsome presents thus tamely yielding rights scotland 
present agreed castles strongholds scotland surrendered hands english commanders garrisons 
immediately done thus archie see english officer lording scotch town lanark 
every scotchman called upon homage english king lord paramount refused seized arrested 
finally th november last date long remembered scotland edward judgment given berwick john baliol declared king scotland 
thus eighteen months scotland kept doubt done doubt enable english rivet yoke upon shoulders intimidate coerce might oppose 
oppose mother true scotchmen refused supremacy king england archie 
one sir malcolm wallace knight small estate refused together eldest son slain encounter english detachment leader named fenwick loudon hill 
father william wallace talk lately slain young selbye son english governor dundee archie 
men say mother although eighteen years age great stature strength handsome presence courteous gentle going quietly streets insulted young selbye companions set upon english soldiers slew several made escape 
say archie 
appears description remarkable young man trust escape vengeance english day may strike blows poor scotland though nominally rule baliol province england 
surely mother scotchmen never remain state shameful servitude trust son fear long shake english yoke 
nobles part norman blood many barons england great jealousies among general effort england possible 
scotland ever freed mighty rising common people even struggle commons scotland whole force england aided feudal power great scotch nobles would well nigh hopeless 
conversation sank deeply archie mind day night thought nothing lost freedom scotland vowed even hope regaining father lands secondary freeing country 
sorts wild dreams boy turn mind longer gay light hearted walked moody thoughtful 
redoubled assiduity practice arms sometimes fighting sandy would think english man arms would strike hotly fiercely sandy greatest difficulty parrying blows forced shout lustily recall clouds 
longer played ball village lads taking elder aside swore secrecy formed band called scottish avengers

lads entered new diversion spirit 
among lower class throughout scotland feeling indignation manner nobles sold country england deep passionate

therefore lads glen cairn entered heart soul projects young chief regarded archie strove best acquire knowledge use sword pike possessed 
younger lads permitted know going none younger archie admitted band elders youths approaching man estate 
even mother archie breathe word feared might forbid proceedings 
good lady often surprised cuts bruises returned home always turned questions muttering something rough play heavy fall months existence scottish avengers remained unsuspected

news traveled slowly glen cairn indeed traveling chapman pedlar passed one villagers went lanark glasgow carrying fowls produce community market news came without 
baliol long discovered monarchy nominal one 
first quarrel arose imperious master concerning action courts 
king edward directed appeal courts westminster judgments scottish courts 
baliol protested specifically agreed treaty brigham scotchman liable called upon plead outside kingdom edward openly declared notwithstanding concessions made baliol became king considered liberty judge case brought scotland would necessary summon king scots appear presence 
compelled baliol formally renounce cancel treaty brigham every stipulation kind known exist might thereafter discovered 
another appeal followed baliol cited appear personally refused thereupon declared contumacious english parliament resolution passed three principal towns scotland seized gave satisfaction 
manifest usurpation even allowing edward claims supremacy well founded 
moment edward became involved quarrel lord superior phillip king france turned summoned appear pain contumacy 
edward met demand renunciation allegiance phillip declaration war called upon baliol aid vassal baliol also vassal french king estates france liable seizure

five thousand welsh foot soldiers crossed bridge pause none seen following

could archie say wallace replied success would little worth nay would harm rather benefit us surrey learning altogether despised believes would prudent future would keep army flat country could nought 
win much one must risk much must wait half surrey army across venture 
presently welsh seen retire 
movement premature 
surrey still asleep nothing could done awoke army armed leisurely surrey bestowed honor knighthood upon many young aspirants

bridge wide enough two three horsemen cross abreast crossed attacked assistance could reach slowly rear 
english knights men arms royal standard banner earl surrey crossed first

tents wagons horses provisions stores english fell hands enemies every scotch soldier obtained rich booty 
cressingham among number killed 
said one english historian account copied many others cressingham body flayed skin divided among scots appears good foundation story although probably cressingham rendered peculiarly obnoxious hateful scots hewn pieces 
even proved ill story true one need excite surprise seeing wholesale slaying plundering burning carried english scottish prisoners falling hands often mutilated tortured executed quartered

thus decisive battle falkirk entirely abortive results 
english crossed border wallace assembled gentlemen still announced intention resigning guardianship scotland leaving country 
announcement received exclamations surprise regret 
surely sir william archie exclaimed mean 
leader unbounded confidence none else 
treachery comyn field falkirk would horse charged english confusion round squares assuredly defeated

edward marched across border seeing scots assembled force season year could hope carry designs fully execution retired without striking blow 
thereupon castle stirling invested scots seeing hope relief surrendered sir william oliphant appointed governor

naturally supposed lost way woods previous day reached encampment morning started questions asked indeed thoughts whole party occupied approaching separation night agreed absolutely necessary 
ladies worn fatigues hardships earl athole elder men also unable longer support

good bishops st andrews glasgow abbot scone many dignitaries scottish church condoned offense seeing committed hot blood without prior intent 
king bitterly regrets deed preys sorely upon mind answer bruce thought meeting comyn dumfries

may nature country hills part bare say covered forest 
thus normans could easily gained upper hand crush last vestiges opposition could 
judge say english scotland hold fortresses people rise remain sheltered assistance comes england 
us different 
first conquer country wide tract third perhaps island drive whole people establish firmly portioning land among soldiery repeopling country english race 
outside district irish chieftains like retain something independence pay tribute position feudatories bound furnish many men king england wars called upon 
english seldom come beyond pale long tribute paid yoke therefore weighs heavy upon us rise english army would pour pale carry fire sword throughout country 
like without one would unite us common enemy 
great chiefs part accepted english titles since power minor chiefs extended rather decreased changed circumstances well content rule districts irish chieftains english lieutenants

people think 
seen english turn land desolation sweep across bring fire sword mountain valleys unless ireland banded common effort 
seen scotland wasted sea sea cities burned people slain thousands dales valleys wasted tell years struggle gained advantage would warrant advising rise england archie silent 
thinking struggle taken part many years remembering woes brought scotland fighting long bruce handful fugitives rathlin sole survivors patriotic party could acknowledge heart justice chiefs words

chieftains archie explaining mission warmly welcomed 
already arms urging part needed despatched messengers throughout country saying emissary scotland arrived calling upon rise join scotch shaking yoke england 
archie therefore travel farther decided could best carry mission assisting organize lead irish forces 
speedily discovered beyond comparison inferior arms discipline methods fighting scots 
dashing foray would excellent 
hardy agile full impetuosity would bear resistance instantly resistance strong stubborn well armed troops would break like wave rock 
archie saw troops anything like regular war would impossible struggle must one constant surprises attacks forays could succeed wearing defeating enemy 
tactics might long perseverance succeed fergus warned would practice courage rather kind would lead dash desperately line levelled spears rather continue long weary struggle apparently hopeless circumstances 
chiefs hearing archie acted one wallace lieutenants battles english heavily defeated willingly consented endeavor instil tactics battles followers found proposed men remain stationary withstand english charges shook heads 
never people said 
must attack sword hand 
rush fearlessly odds never get steadily withstand charge men arms 
archie however persuaded allow organize band two hundred men immediate orders 
armed long pikes form sort reserve order wild charge main body failed object could cover retreat serve nucleus around could rally 
army swelled rapidly every day fresh chiefs arrived scores wild tribesmen 
presently news came english force advancing pale 
council held archie present 
strongly urged views upon chieftains namely altogether decline pitched battle divided numerous parties enter pale destroying weak garrisons ravaging country trying wear english constant skirmishes night attacks refusing always allow tempted engagement 
english everywhere urged 
let hold ground feet stand

hope ultimate success 
advice received silence saw betokened disapproval 
one another irish chieftains rose declared war could sustained 
retainers said ready fight fighting want return homes besides fifteen thousand strong english men arms marching us eight hundred would shameful cowardly avoid battle willing followers would obey us 
let us first destroy body english shall joined others soon march straight upon dublin

seeing slaughter taken place rejoiced heart rising commenced joined way result mission one sporadic insurrections frequently broke ireland instantly sternly repressed
