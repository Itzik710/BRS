amazing interlude indeed sara lee decorated king troops drawn honor rumbling great guns 
palpitating dazed sara lee decoration fastened black jacket sara lee whose hat blew exactly worst moment rolled end like hoop puddle

humble flushed sara lee watched gray car go flying street later 
went told whole story harvey picture difficult feel hearing

later harvey words 
fair sloughing wound would heal 
evening henri came 
first time gay self least surface 
though knowing going would leave sara lee feeling never returned inflicted lasting hurt 
everywhere little house elbowing way among men cheery nonsense bantering weary ones smiled carrying hot water sara lee helping bad dressing

inexhaustible stock riddles almost never guessed 
would tell answer laugh delightedly 
pain seemed leave little room entered 
night henri disappeared 
xvii question settle henri 
two questions indeed 
one matter engineering bottom fell world henri studied engineering 
second serious 
first thing happened 
trenches held belgians undeniably worst 
properly speaking trenches shallow gutters dug foot two saturated ground built man high bags earth sand 
dug purely shelters railway embankment planks sandbags reinforced rails deserted track behind hidden 
corner belgium saved turning shallow lake 
opening gates dikes allies let sea placed flood front advancing enemy 
battle front reeking pond 
opposing armies lived like duck hunters swamp 
dig foot encounter water 
machine guns sat six inches yellow flood 
men lay pools fire 
reach outposts narrow paths built first bags earth life sometimes every bag 
filling sufficient top path fascines bound together bundles made footway 
reason belgians approached trenches deep cuts gave shelter cover darkness night 
day lay shallow dugouts cut connection world behind 
food cooked miles away came night cold unappetizing 
water exhausted canteens nothing brackish tide ill smelling reeking fever 
water carts trundled forward night often far 
belgians faced future long years anxiety trained fight 
way trained fight losing war could hope defeat greedy neighbor east 
found fighting almost condemned inactivity almost passively slaughtered enemy artillery living conditions would sapped courage less desperate people 
add difficulties sea encroach turning fertile land salt marsh winter rains unusually heavy tragic first winter lacking usual egress sea spread flood 
many places well back lines fields flooded roads sadly needed lost unfordable wallows mud water 
henri knowing none better first question settle spring advanced flood commenced recede 
time came trenches huddled shallow behind railway track one could live certain comfort 
deeper ones bottom trench appeared first time 
day previous however water commenced come back 
rain little little certain place yellow ill smelling little streams began flow sluggishly trenches 
seeped rather flowed 
first belgian officers laid bad luck persistently pursued 
held conference small brick house maps pine tables picture american harvester wall headquarters 
sitting hanging lamp orderly making coffee stove corner talked 
henri silent elders intently listening 
last turned 
go find said quietly 
possible though see 
smiled 
think drying expense 
bit german humor 
cry calais month air undoubtedly renewed activity along german front near sea 
second question answered dependent first 
germans henri said merely shifted water clever engineering belgian trenches bigger thing hand instance attempt drain inundation smash belgian line march dunkirk road calais night henri jested pierre right elbow watched sara lee smile difficult work 
sometime near midnight slipped away 
jean waiting street wrung boy hand 
could go said rather wistfully 
speak ugly tongue 
could mute shell shock 
could helping back 
henri held hand moment shook head 
would double risk good would two pistols better one 
two pistols friend said henri turned corner building past boards ren built toward house mill 
jean sight stopped moment hand resting frail wall sara lee room 
good 
three days jean stayed village 
slept mill came meals little house 
went dunkirk brought provisions mail including sara lee monthly allowance 
mostly sat mill house waited 
could read 
eat jean sara lee said 
twice insisted feverish placed hand somewhat marred much peeling vegetables forehead 
entirely well mademoiselle would say draw back 
anxieties enough without reminded touch woman hand lost 
long sara lee learned question jean henri absences 
even knowledge knew something henri work remove barrier 
sara lee waited jean helplessly 
knew something wrong jean privilege going night trenches waiting staring gray water ugly floating shadows henri emerge flood 
something rather forced mechanical days work 
smile rather set 
sleep well 
one night violated henri orders walked across softened fields beyond poplar trees 
nothing see except intermittent flash clouds hung low sea nieuport british gunboats bombarding coast steady streaks ypres salient night day guns never rested 
belgian trenches fifteen hundred feet away sound 
german electric signal blazed message code went quickly 
rifle shot thin sharp rang floating starlights keen eyes side watched movements 
sara lee sat tree watched 
found crying softly 
sad useless cruel 
somewhere ahead henri henri blue eyes smile ardor young arms henri many friends 
sara lee never deceived henri 
loved 
quite certain love entirely different 
knew last impossible engaged harvey 
probably truth loved entirely different ways 
men always insisted possibilities even asserted right love two women time 
women less frank 
cases grand passion 
tenderness joy companionship sometimes touching dependence 
love burns white fire 
perhaps sara lee one women always loved love 
women selfish seeking love softly feminine kind appealing genuine 
men need altar lay tribute 
high remote white altar sara lee already received love two strong men 
troubling head night however altar sort 
cried little first terrified henri jean face growing pinched gray 
cried hard prone ground face henri young life 
missing 
henri undeniably missing 
even king knew set heart among crosses henri full name may know took pacing little study looking spring sea 
night marie ladled bottom kettle found sara lee missing told ren direction taken 
marie muttering set find almost stumbled wood road 
sat ground without word placed clumsy hand girl shoulder 
sara lee ceased sobbing spoke far hopeless mademoiselle 
established system communication 
sara lee spoke orders halting french general conversation beyond 
much hearing english taught belgian girl enough follow 
sara lee replied smothered english gone marie 
never come back 
tell many missing dead 
sara lee shuddered 
spies made prisoners 
rights prisoners war 
governments protect 
henri capture death 
could say marie 
marie sat softly stroking sara lee hair eyes tragic tearless 
even said bad die one country 
thing terrible leaves behind bitterness grief hope mademoiselle even many prayers one died traitor 
coaxed sara lee back last 
went fields fresh troops thrown belgian trenches street full men 
great dray horses dragging forward batteries heavy guns sliding slipping absence information henri wont bring best provide worst

great generals often tall great stopped little house implore sara lee leave

sometimes standing streets sara lee saw one far overhead balloon shaped clouds bursting shells hung far 
twice early morning german plane flying low one could easily see black cross wing reconnoitered village wagon trains troops 
always found empty 
hope almost fled 
afternoons marie went ruined church knelt heap marble masonry altar prayed 
sara lee brought protestant never entered catholic church took going 
strange fashion peace former days seemed cling little structure roofless 
quiet days silence deeper elsewhere 
days much firing sound within broken walls seemed deadened far away 
marie burned candle prayed soul purgatory loved pitied 
sara lee burned candle knelt sometimes beside marie sometimes alone prayed many things henri living somewhere war might end day would little wounding day belgians might go home back america harvey might grow understand forgive 
looked depths soul days prayed homeland might late see thing seeing 
wanton waste ghastly cruelty germans brought war 
sara lee vague thinking began crystallize 
war judgment sent high sinful world 
wicked imposition one nation nations 
national 
almost racial 
war hate german side 
never believed hate 
ugly passions world jealousy envy suspicion hate 
word rather limited vocabulary 
hate part men knew 
officers stopped way trenches gentlemen soldiers 
determined grave resented even loathed 
hate 
little belgian soldiers bewildered puzzled desperately resentful 
hate translated terms frightfulness understanding 
yet side coming methods war wantonly cruel useless save inflicting needless agony hate could devise 
strategic value justified 
spontaneous outgrowths venom nursed winter deadlock grown full size destructive power 
rumor gas seared killed came little house early february 
march came first victims poor writhing creatures deprived boon air seared lungs collapsed agonized faces drawn masks suffering 
died little house even death faces held imprint horror 
sara lee burying anxiety cloak service came new terrible thoughts 
war 
germans sent clouds poisoned gas across inundation made attempt follow 
killing lust killing suffering joy inflicting pain 
day later heard hague convention 
known 
learned gentlemen agreement among nations said use poison poisoned weapons forbidden 
pondered carefully trying think dispassionately 
received copy home newspaper saw use poison gases denied germans america set rumor hysteria 
cold spring day sat table salle manger wrote letter president beginning dear sir telling knew poison gas 
also second thought wrote one andrew carnegie built library city 
felt expense sending one investigate would prohibitive something must done 
never heard either letters felt better written 
day two later received mrs travers england small supply first gas masks war 
simple primitive first masks useless turned square folded gauze soaked solution dried tapes tie mouth nose 
adjust soldiers stoop wet ever present water trench tie 
sara lee gave night much mirth little house mirth since henri went away 
belgians called bal masque putting bowed one another requested dances even flirted coyly bits white gauze 
middle gayety one propounded one henri idiotic riddles sara lee went across little room closed door stood eyes shut fear would scream 
one day coming little church saw low broken gray car turn top street come slowly slowly toward

take roundabout lanes avoiding main highways 
fortunately always night friendly houses kind hands lift henri warm fire lighted interiors 
many messages brought back cheer often tragedy small farmsteads belgium 
finally holland chartering boat last sang henri chopping cotton making great show cheerfulness sara lee 
jean sometimes showed black depression beneath

happy unhappy mend slowly 
time asked jean take away harvey photograph recur subject need 
jean knew perhaps even better henri boy recklessly hopelessly quite rationally love american girl 
also henri fretting work 
sometimes night following henri instructions jean wandered quietly along roads paths paralleled front 
times eyes turned toward trenches toward flat country lay behind still dotted time groves trees canals overhung pollard willows farmhouse night took starlight appearance whole 
singularly white peaceful small steadings belgium night hours cruel dawn showed skeletons dead homes clothed night wraithlike roofs chimneys ghosts houses appearing midnight cock crow

one night tragedy came little house mercy

afternoon following talk belle came home three clock

older woman safe place might continue support none would assume responsibility crushing young girl life 
quite frank possibly harvey appeal would carried less weight coincided sara lee request money 
neither one alone would brought catastrophe altogether made question answer problem solution

unusual go trenches nights men could come little house 
always joyously welcomed always way back turned send poplar trees inarticulate aching call come somehow believe

men ceased watch henri parapet brave deeds become fireside tales told home ever homes 
one night henri came back came gone shadows swallowed came without much sound sniper rifle herald 
strange thin henri close starvation dripping water everything german uniform close indeed death called 
wild excitement indeed 
bearded private soldiers forgetting name rank must told patted thin shoulders 
officers lived horrors also may told crowded shook hands 
though graveyard back fields come alive smiling dearly beloved friend 
would told story wet weary 
wait said led motley band officers men intermixed forgetting decorum toward village 
overtook lines men left trenches moving slow weary gait road 
news spread column 
muffled cheers 
figures stepped darkness hands 
henri clasped many could 
escort passed men fell almost without orders columns four swung behind 
band thousand throats yet cautiously passed poplar trees gradually swelled grew marching song 
behind henri strange guard honor muddy tired torn even wounded marched sang trou l l ne va gu trou l l e ne va pas 
sara lee listening first shuffle many feet sounded like wind trees water pebbles brook paused work lifted head 
rhythm marching feet came wooden shutters 
building seemed vibrate 
growling sound soon knew deep voices singing men 
went door stood looking street 
behind warm glow lamp snug invitation little house 
group soldiers paused front doorway one emerged tall white infinitely weary looked unbelieving eyes 
words meetings

noise gayety little house mercy 
much happiness 
think may leave henri sara lee jean one eye faithful heart marie kettles even ren still strange way belonged little house though something precious abandon 
amazing interlude become play 
never sara lee would lights go front henri adoring eyes open arms fade shadows 
drama war plays 
great playwright sees fit take away well beloved players 
new faces appear disappear 
music thunder many guns 
henri still plays big part sara lee little one 
yet shall say end one done better new ever new standards love remains chief 
love sara lee one quality love kind tired men weary love shall one day knit broken world together 
love one man 
weary nights henri lost shadows sara lee work done men gone sits little house mercy waits 
stars clear evenings shine roofless buildings rubbish mill ruined poplar trees small acre peace tiny crosses mark long sleep weary soldiers 
sometimes though knows heart reads aloud letter henri 
comforts 
promise 
think somewhere perhaps ren side since loved 
shall still calling waiting 
perhaps even beyond stars need little house mercy 
god knows wherever shall need
