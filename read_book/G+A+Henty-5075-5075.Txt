chapter x passage rhine suppose nigel graheme said officers regiment assembled one imperialist tents night battle leipzig shall press forward vienna general opinion throughout swedish army intention gustavus

chapter xv timely rescue although unaware much formidable task become peasants disheartened defeat even boldest hesitated thought attacking foes formidably posted 
none returned able explain obstacle checked advance 
could tell fallen cases even touched spears defenders 
mystery added dread assault difficult position naturally inspired hours spent discussing next attack made 
many indeed strongly favor remaining quietly around tower starving defenders surrendering 
others advocated attempt stifle heaping green wood damp straw round tower timid pointed many would killed carrying task firearms besieged even combustibles placed position lighted success experiment would means certain besieged might stuff orifices worst might obtain sufficient fresh air top tower enable breathe 
forgetting one peasants exclaimed powder wagon broke count tilly retreated lech

indignant hepburn resigned commission swore never draw sword service king resolution adhered although gustavus anger cooled endeavored every way appease angry soldier

probably faults sides 
scottish troops backbone swedish army principally due almost whole successes gustavus gained 
doubtless presumed upon fact although gustavus recognized obligations shown immense number commands governorships bestowed upon scottish officers may well angered irritated insistance asserted claims services 
however unfortunate circumstance critical moment lost services officer whose prudence equal daring unquestionably one greatest military leaders age 
probable hepburn remained side king would undertaken attack upon impregnable position imperialists 
deprived counsellor upon whose advice hitherto invariably relied gustavus determined attempt drive wallenstein position decision finally induced ruse imperialist commander desired nothing much swedes dash forces terrible position prepared 
accordingly th august directed considerable portion force march away rear position alarmed superior strength swedes determined abandon heights long occupied march away
