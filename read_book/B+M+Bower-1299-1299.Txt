coming hill toward wagalexa conka climbing swiftly looking came 
annie many ponies sprang feet startling little black dog gave yelp astonishment 
came peace hesitated watching unwinkingly 
something swelled chest could hardly breathe fluttered like prisoned bird 
cola gasped breath raised hand outward sweeping gesture spoke peace 
theenk fix trap whirled faced ramon whose eyes blazed bate murder whose tongue spoke foulness soul 
flung arm fiercely thrust aside 
kill dam say six shooter levelled luck dropped nerveless hand like coiled adder annie many ponies struck 
like avenging spirit pulled knife free held high head facing luck stared 
thought look eyes fear law lifted hand gave back peace sign 
killed punished could save 
luck failed read look aright fear saw farewell 
free hand made sign peace farewell knife descended straight plummet heart 
even fell spurned dead ramon feet rolled little way black dog growled bared teeth even death would touch foul 
luck ran last steep steps took arms 
eyes blurred could see face voice shook could scarcely form words brushed back death soul brought smile eyes 
annie little sister annie many ponies raised one creeping hand groping fingers touched face 
wagalexa conka cola took fingers instant yet could feel laid lips
