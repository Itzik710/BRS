ivan dmitritch gromov man thirty three gentleman birth court usher provincial secretary suffers mania persecution 
either lies curled bed walks corner corner though exercise rarely sits 
always excited agitated overwrought sort vague undefined expectation 
faintest rustle entry shout yard enough make raise head begin listening whether coming whether looking 
times face expresses utmost uneasiness repulsion 
like broad face high cheek bones always pale unhappy reflecting though mirror soul tormented conflict long continued terror 
grimaces strange abnormal delicate lines traced face profound genuine suffering show intelligence sense warm healthy light eyes 
like man courteous anxious use extraordinarily gentle everyone except nikita 
anyone drops button spoon jumps bed quickly picks every day says good morning companions goes bed wishes good night 
besides continually overwrought condition grimaces madness shows following way also 
sometimes evenings wraps dressing gown trembling teeth chattering begins walking rapidly corner corner bedsteads 
seems though violent fever 
way suddenly stops glances companions seen longing say something important apparently reflecting would listen would understand shakes head impatiently goes pacing 
soon desire speak gets upper hand every consideration let go speak fervently passionately 
talk disordered feverish like delirium disconnected always intelligible hand something extremely fine may felt words voice 
talks recognize lunatic man 
difficult reproduce paper insane talk 
speaks baseness mankind violence trampling justice glorious life one day upon earth window gratings remind every minute stupidity cruelty oppressors 
makes disorderly incoherent potpourri themes old yet date 
ii twelve fifteen years ago official called gromov highly respectable prosperous person living house principal street town

sergey student fourth year taken ill galloping consumption died death first whole series calamities suddenly showered gromov family 
within week sergey funeral old father put trial fraud misappropriation died typhoid prison hospital soon afterwards 
house belongings sold auction ivan dmitritch mother left entirely without means 
hitherto father lifetime ivan dmitritch studying university petersburg received allowance sixty seventy roubles month conception poverty make abrupt change life 
spend time morning night giving lessons next nothing work copying go hungry earnings sent keep mother 
ivan dmitritch could stand life lost heart strength giving university went home 
interest obtained post teacher district school could get colleagues liked boys soon gave post 
mother died 
six months without work living nothing bread water became court usher 
kept post dismissed owing illness 
never even young student days given impression perfectly healthy 
always pale thin given catching cold ate little slept badly 
single glass wine went head made hysterical 
always craving society owing irritable temperament suspiciousness never became intimate anyone friends 
always spoke contempt fellow townsmen saying coarse ignorance sleepy animal existence seemed loathsome horrible 
spoke loud tenor heat invariably either scorn indignation wonder enthusiasm always perfect sincerity 
whatever one talked always brought round subject life dull stifling town townspeople lofty interests lived dingy meaningless life diversified violence coarse profligacy hypocrisy scoundrels well fed clothed honest men lived hand mouth needed schools progressive local paper theater public lectures co ordination intellectual elements society must see failings horrified 
criticisms people laid colors thick using black white fine shades mankind divided honest men scoundrels nothing 
always spoke passion enthusiasm women love never love 
spite severity judgments nervousness liked behind back spoken affectionately vanya 
innate refinement readiness service good breeding moral purity shabby coat frail appearance family misfortunes aroused kind warm sorrowful feeling 
moreover well educated well read according townspeople notions knew everything eyes something like walking encyclopedia 
read great deal 
would sit club nervously pulling beard looking magazines books face one could see reading devouring pages without giving time digest read 
must supposed reading one morbid habits fell upon anything came hands equal avidity even last year newspapers calendars 
home always read lying 
iii one autumn morning ivan dmitritch turning collar greatcoat splashing mud made way side streets back lanes see artisan collect payment owing 
gloomy mood always morning 
one side streets met two convicts fetters four soldiers rifles charge 
ivan dmitritch often met convicts always excited feelings compassion discomfort meeting made peculiar strange impression 
suddenly seemed reason might put fetters led mud prison like 
visiting artisan way home met near post office police superintendent acquaintance greeted walked paces along street reason seemed suspicious 
home could get convicts soldiers rifles head day unaccountable inward agitation prevented reading concentrating mind 
evening light lamp night could sleep kept thinking might arrested put fetters thrown prison 
know harm done could certain would never guilty murder arson theft future either easy commit crime accident unconsciously false witness always possible indeed miscarriage justice without good reason agelong experience simple people teaches beggary prison ills none safe 
judicial mistake possible legal proceedings conducted nowadays nothing wondered 
people official professional relation men sufferings instance judges police officers doctors course time habit grow callous even wish take formal attitude clients respect different peasant slaughters sheep calves back yard notice blood 
formal soulless attitude human personality judge needs one thing time order deprive innocent man rights property condemn penal servitude 
time spent performing certain formalities judge paid salary 
may look vain justice protection dirty wretched little town hundred fifty miles railway station indeed absurd even think justice every kind violence accepted society rational consistent necessity every act mercy instance verdict acquittal calls forth perfect outburst dissatisfied revengeful feeling morning ivan dmitritch got bed state horror cold perspiration forehead completely convinced might arrested minute 
since gloomy thoughts yesterday haunted long thought must truth 
could indeed come mind without grounds whatever 
policeman walking slowly passed windows nothing 
two men standing still silent near house 
silent agonizing days nights followed ivan dmitritch 
everyone passed windows came yard seemed spy detective 
midday chief police usually drove street pair horses going estate near town police department ivan dmitritch fancied every time driving especially quickly peculiar expression evident haste announce important criminal town 
ivan dmitritch started every ring bell knock gate agitated whenever came upon anyone new landlady met police officers gendarmes smiled began whistling seem unconcerned 
could sleep whole nights succession expecting arrested snored loudly sighed though deep sleep landlady might think asleep could sleep meant tormented stings conscience piece evidence facts common sense persuaded terrors nonsense morbidity one looked matter broadly nothing really terrible arrest imprisonment long conscience ease sensibly logically reasoned acute agonizing mental distress became 
might compared story hermit tried cut dwelling place virgin forest zealously worked axe thicker forest grew 
end ivan dmitritch seeing useless gave reasoning altogether abandoned entirely despair terror 
began avoid people seek solitude 
official work distasteful became unbearable 
afraid would somehow get trouble would put bribe pocket unnoticed denounce would accidentally make mistake official papers would appear fraudulent would lose people money 
strange imagination never times agile inventive every day thought thousands different reasons seriously anxious freedom honor hand interest outer world books particular grew sensibly fainter memory began fail 
spring snow melted found ravine near cemetery two half decomposed corpses bodies old woman boy bearing traces death violence 
nothing talked bodies unknown murderers 
people might think guilty crime ivan dmitritch walked streets smiling met acquaintances turned pale flushed began declaring greater crime murder weak defenceless 
duplicity soon exhausted reflection decided position best thing hide landlady cellar 
sat cellar day night another day fearfully cold waiting till dusk stole secretly like thief back room 
stood middle room till daybreak listening without stirring 
early morning sunrise workmen came house 
ivan dmitritch knew perfectly well come mend stove kitchen terror told police officers disguised workmen 
slipped stealthily flat overcome terror ran along street without cap coat 
dogs raced barking peasant shouted somewhere behind wind whistled ears seemed ivan dmitritch force violence whole world massed together behind back chasing 
stopped brought home landlady sent doctor 
doctor andrey yefimitch shall say hereafter prescribed cold compresses head laurel drops shook head went away telling landlady come one interfere people going minds 
means live home nursed ivan dmitritch soon sent hospital put ward venereal patients

iv ivan dmitritch neighbor left hand said already jew moiseika neighbor right hand peasant rolling fat almost spherical blankly stupid face utterly devoid thought 
motionless gluttonous unclean animal long ago lost powers thought feeling 
acrid stifling stench always comes

fifth last inhabitant ward man artisan class sorter post office thinnish fair little man good natured rather sly face

sometimes goes window turning back companions puts something breast bending head looks go moment overcome confusion snatches something breast 
difficult guess secret 
congratulate often says ivan dmitritch presented stanislav order second degree star 
second degree star given foreigners reason want make exception says smile shrugging shoulders perplexity 
must confess expect 
understand anything ivan dmitritch replies morosely 
know shall attain sooner later former sorter persists screwing eyes slyly

order worth working white cross black ribbon 
beautiful

patients condemned see day day one nikita 
rather strange rumor however circulating hospital late 
rumored doctor begun visit ward 
v strange rumor dr andrey yefimitch ragin strange man way 
say young religious prepared clerical career finished studies high school intended enter theological academy father surgeon doctor medicine jeered declared point blank would disown became priest 
far true know andrey yefimitch confessed never natural bent medicine science general 
however may finished studies medical faculty enter priesthood 
showed special devoutness like priest beginning medical career 
exterior heavy coarse like peasant face beard flat hair coarse clumsy figure suggest overfed intemperate harsh innkeeper highroad 
face surly looking covered blue veins eyes little nose red 
height broad shoulders huge hands feet one would think blow fist would knock life anyone step soft walk cautious insinuating meets anyone narrow passage always first stop make way say bass one would expect high soft tenor beg pardon little swelling neck prevents wearing stiff starched collars always goes soft linen cotton shirts 
altogether dress like doctor 
wears suit ten years new clothes usually buys jewish shop look shabby crumpled old ones sees patients dines pays visits coat due niggardliness complete carelessness appearance 
andrey yefimitch came town take duties institution founded glory god terrible condition 
one could hardly breathe stench wards passages courtyards hospital 
hospital servants nurses children slept wards together patients 
complained living beetles bugs mice 
surgical wards never free erysipelas 
two scalpels one thermometer whole hospital potatoes kept baths 
superintendent housekeeper medical assistant robbed patients old doctor andrey yefimitch predecessor people declared secretly sold hospital alcohol kept regular harem consisting nurses female patients 
disorderly proceedings perfectly well known town even exaggerated people took calmly justified ground peasants working men hospital could dissatisfied since much worse home hospital fed woodcocks others said excuse town alone without help zemstvo equal maintaining good hospital thank god one even poor one 
newly formed zemstvo open infirmaries either town neighborhood relying fact town already hospital 
looking hospital andrey yefimitch came conclusion immoral institution extremely prejudicial health townspeople 
opinion sensible thing could done let patients close hospital 
reflected alone enough would useless physical moral impurity driven one place would move another one must wait wither away besides people open hospital put must need superstition nastiness abominations daily life necessary since process time worked something sensible manure turns black earth 
nothing earth good something nasty first origin 
andrey yefimitch undertook duties apparently greatly concerned irregularities hospital 
asked attendants nurses sleep wards two cupboards instruments put superintendent housekeeper medical assistant erysipelas remained unchanged 
andrey yefimitch loved intelligence honesty intensely strength belief right organize intelligent honest life 
absolutely unable give orders forbid things insist 
seemed though taken vow never raise voice never make use imperative 
difficult say 
fetch bring wanted meals would cough hesitatingly say cook tea dinner dismiss superintendent tell leave stealing abolish unnecessary parasitic post altogether absolutely beyond powers 
andrey yefimitch deceived flattered accounts knew cooked brought sign would turn red crab feel guilty yet would sign accounts 
patients complained hungry roughness nurses would confused mutter guiltily well well go later likely misunderstanding first andrey yefimitch worked zealously 
saw patients every day morning till dinner time performed operations even attended confinements 
ladies said attentive clever diagnosing diseases especially women children 
process time work unmistakably wearied monotony obvious uselessness 
day one sees thirty patients morrow increased thirty five next day forty day day year year mortality town decrease patients leave coming 
real help forty patients morning dinner physically possible could lead deception
