man right take step preliminary discharge admitted power incident power follow make incident principle convert justification acts unlawful

abuse admitted power board ascertain character ship created lively feeling us americans induce us forego wholesome principles necessary well civilized nations 
thus judgment quite recently erroneously laid doctrine foreign vessels war shall board american ships coast africa time peace order ascertain character

first place lay claim spurious patriotism says country right wrong 
may rabble god first highest obligations due 
neither country man justify wrong conceive wrong political moral sense deny vessel war privilege england claims 
see one plausible argument founded abuses may arise practice 
anticipate abuses instance 
every right whether national international may abused exercise argument good anything good every right international law 
abuse occurred might justifiable reason suspending exercise admitted right remedies applied prevent recurrence never urged proper argument right 
abuses occur get remedied proper representations last fail usual appeal nations

admitting dogma common law inherently wise confessedly practice parallel necessity case arrest shore arrest sea
