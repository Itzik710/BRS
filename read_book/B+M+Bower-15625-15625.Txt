queer fellow wanted roll rock shatter unearthly blue mirror million ripples 
looked away northwest mount lassen sent lazy column thin grayish vapor trailing high air thought little expected see much talked volcano completely irrevocably past two days changed life 
tuesday day yesterday whooping along beach venice wading diving breakers combed booming lunge sand cluttered humanity play 
blandly expected go playing whenever mood bunch invited 
night last danced drunk much wine made impulsive love girl never seen life held arms went swaying gliding dipping together across polished floor carefree gulls outside sand 
night last driven home winced pulled thoughts back drive 
girls listen foolish speeches wine music boom breakers gulls

far though taken flight moon 
sound save whispering rush wind blew bare mountain top 
pines could faintly hear murmur branches 
world lay hushed silent silence far distances 
shadows lay slope far canyons moved like ghosts across tumbled wilderness 
minute immensity silence blue distance lulled thoughts feeling security peace

emptiness pressed upon like weight crushed youth strength youthful optimism left old weak faded shadow humanity like shadows canyon 
stealthily afraid tangible shape reaching silence hand went telephone receiver

blue haze far distance deepened thickening air 
four times last ten days swung pointer mapped table sighted upon brown puffballs rose treetops first betraying marks licking flames 
watched puff balls grow exploded rolling clouds smoke yellow flames mounted high dead pine cedar black pitch stump took fire 
telephoned alarm headquarters would watch anxiously spreading pall

every pine fell whether old age fire woodmen axe touched sense personal loss

next day insisted upon meeting ridge beyond toll gate basin climbing cave 
soon breath enough talk agreed emphatically vocabulary flexible voice would permit 
made order say perfect jealous could

marion thought snow mountain would keen suggested jack try pair shoes see manage wear whenever snow 
feet small man well tiny woman would spend much time hiking around hills person would think course made tracks 
impulsive young woman believed things spot thereupon retired behind corner rock presently threw one high lace boots jack 
crumpled toes jack thought could wear

shoulders drawn together chill struck even heavy sweater coat went following tracks made coming 
almost obliterated snow went slithering drifts like creeping cloud except heavier gust lifted high air flung blinding swirl 
battling wind sent warmth body hands feet numb skirted highest deepest solidest drift crept desolate fissure opening lair

hank brown found jack set sheriff trail would believed knew hated jack fight 
jack told keeping cause fogged generalities 
night wind howled mountainside ranted forest marion could sleep 
twice heard tree go splitting outstretched arms close neighbors fall crash quivered cabin 
glad jack camp cave

hoped morning would bring calm wanted see jack take magazines tell hank 
morning snowing raining turns gusty blasts wind

heard douglas say kate fred decide inform chief police hearing something soon 
trial probably started would certainly waste time

fence corner marion hesitated standing back wind snow driving past faint hiss clashing particles voice sleeting blizzard 
could take old abandoned road led ridge topped taylor rock would find walking easier perhaps 
road followed line least resistance hills line means straight 
jack would probably cave storm hope meeting slope day 
still might start mountain rate would shortest way 
turned along fence following trail done mike coming though stalking game warily swiftly face set eager eyes shining hunting lust 
hill went bracing wind swept open spaces shivering cold fearful great roaring overhead pinetops swayed drunkenly clashing branches dead limbs broke came crashing bringing showers snow bark broken twigs stripped needles resisting branches path 
afraid went fast could consoling fear shrewd thought storm would serve hold back sheriff give jack time get away somewhere 
one would dream traveling day kept telling 
getting worse instead better snow coming thicker sleet lessening 
going quite climb cave wind must simply terrible could see jack would never expect weather would stay close camp fire 
top hill wind swooped upon flung clouds snow face half blinded 
turned back upon blinked rapidly vision cleared stood panting tempted turn back 
one would crazy enough venture today

looked back trail followed 
wherever wind clean sweep tracks filling already snow 
wait jack got away track 
really owed much chance beat 
put muff shielded face sting frozen snowflakes went buffeted steep slope kate sprained ankle thinking must careful set feet would frightful accident 
expect meet jack farther edge gulch stood minute beside great pine looking trampled snow thinking hank brown leering insinuations 
whatever started fellow suspecting things uneasily followed hank cunning reasoning jack never gone quincy except settle forest service summer work jack filed upon claim mountains yet stayed apart kind avoided people little things made sum hank suspicions well blame present emergency rate 
told kate something right tell would quite much worry 
turned began climb making way thicket fringed long ridge beyond like great swollen tongue reaching toward valley ridge followed spite tangled masses young trees bushes must fight reach open timber 
least danger falling trees branches great wind quite keen 
behind mike followed doggedly trailing like hound 
days spent watching nights spent crouched waiting brought high pitch desperation would stop nothing seemed crazed brain necessary save life freedom 
even disdainful murphy would known man insane murphy sitting warm snug beside small table glass ready right hand murphy worrying mike sanity next card would fall 
murphy thought lucky quincy storm instead cooped little cabin mike would sit day mumble never say anything worth listening 
mike kept hunt like gentle natured dog gone mad dangerous taking man trail unhindered unsuspected 
chapter twenty one gold repentance sunlight love man gone mad marion foot last grilling climb steep acclivity manzanita shrubs locked arms laughed climber 
fearful sprained ankle like kate watched carefully set feet considered would wise choose carefully route follow gain top long climbing general direction felt uneasiness taylor rock topped bound come somewhere close point aiming

one solid mass blanketed snow looked stepped carefully upon rock surveyed slope 
borne far right away staggering rush wind 
hated turn face storm made way around line timber choice 
retreated manzanita fought way around finding farther dreamed finding storm desperate thing one face long open 
made timber stood leaning sheltered side dark trunked spruce whose branches thick wide spread enough shield 
physical labor fighting way thus far high altitude attained made pant like runner race 
held muff face sense warmth well soft fur gave cheeks 
certainly one else would fool enough come day thought 
surprise jack seeing come puffing cave since snow fell thanksgiving 
nearly christmas month solitary grandeur jack endured 
glanced tossing boughs felt great tree trunk quiver fresh blast swept top looked misty whiteness storm clouded swaying pine branches 
world afraid somehow felt big rough friendliness even 
occur mountains could work ill though reminded standing still best way keep warm day 
started ignorantly keeping among trees mountaineer would shunned 
straightway stopped looked around puzzled 
surely come way skirted manzanita

two men went ahead blankets gunny sack supplies broke trail murphy lady whose mission remained altogether mystery whose manner altogether discouraging curiosity 
us never experienced hardships never plumbed black depths trouble never suffered desperate anguish prone belittle suffering others 
mrs singleton corey always secretly believed suffering meant merely certain bearable degree discomfort 
exalted moments contemplated simple living desirable thing good purge one soul trivialities 
life raw picturesque 
changed mind suddenness painful tottered thankfully toll gate cabin found main room unswept breakfast dishes cold cluttered upon rough homemade table 
kate crying couch room close enough heating stove could keep fire without putting injured foot floor

vastly relieved see explanation accepted know quincy ever heard auto bandit affair forgotten long ago
