think breathing digesting circulating blood attention spare anything else find cost anything goes wrong operations 
want unconscious wanted acquire finally win want 
win unconsciousness habits cost losing control also build one habit corresponding functional modification organs another become dependent old habits 
consequently persist even hurt us
