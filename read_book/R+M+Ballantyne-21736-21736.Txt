thus engaged shall turn aside little tell reader one two brief sentences got place 
shipped merchant ship liverpool sailed west coast africa 
arrived found party command portuguese trader set interior 
could speak little english arranged go far intended proceed learn much native language possible company obtain native guide conduct us country gorillas found 
native guide arranged explained trader object visiting country might tell tribes intended visit 
found absolutely needful precaution following ground 
natives africa singular bad style carrying trade white men visit shores 
traffic consists chiefly ivory barwood wood much used dyeing indiarubber 
natives far interior allowed convey commodities directly coast law land means law strongest absolute savages obliged deliver goods care tribe next pass next tribe go tribe tribe till reach coast sold tribe 
price obtained usually consists guns powder shot looking glasses cloth sundry articles trinkets useful men savage state returned owners far interior channel tribe deducts percentage trouble price dwindles goes mere trifle sometimes nothing remains handed unfortunate people tribe originally sent goods sale 
course system almost paralyses trade 
intermediate tribes coast interior gainers system exceedingly jealous anything like attempt carry direct trade 
ready go war tribes interior attempt throw opposition way white men ever penetrate interior purpose 
thus seen travels would hindered much stopped altogether regarded jealousy perhaps murdered motives going inland fully satisfactorily explained different tribes passed lands 
therefore proposed overcome difficulty taking native guide us tribe chance residing obliged separate portuguese trader

vain attempt describe state feelings memorable occasion fervor thanked heavenly father friend deliverance delight shook hands embraced 
considerable difficulty extricated peterkin entanglement 
accomplished proceeded examine prize 
little puzzled discovering three bullets struck bull 
part fired straight forehead felt certain time shots taken effect yet one ball animal head undoubtedly peterkin hair round hole singed near fired 
two shots rather wide apart one shoulder neck 
would proved mortal long run neither sufficiently near vital spot kill speedily

chapter four 
wherein found much philosophical 
skinned leopard cut much buffalo meat could carry started negro village round pace already lost much time last adventure 
walked along could help meditating uncertainty life terrible suddenness might unexpected moment cut 
thoughts led naturally reflect important matter every one matter young state preparedness quit world 
also reflected without feeling shame want nerve deeply impressed importance boys inured childhood trifling risks light dangers every possible description tumbling ponds trees etcetera order strengthen nervous system 
course mean say boys ought deliberately tumble ponds climb trees fall ought avoid risk mishaps 
ought encounter risks many others perpetually 
ought practice leaping heights deep water 
ought never hesitate cross stream narrow unsafe plank fear ducking 
ought never decline climb tree pull fruit merely possibility falling breaking necks 
firmly believe boys intended encounter kinds risks order prepare meet grapple risks dangers incident man career cool cautious self possession self possession founded experimental knowledge character powers spirits muscles 
also concluded reasoning applies extent girls well boys liable life occasional encounters danger meeting mad bulls run away horseback upset boats set fire means crinoline cases trained risk slight mishaps early life find nerves equal shock minds cool collected enough look around take hasty advantage opportunity escape may exist unhappily nurtured excessive delicacy advised earliest childhood take care carefully avoid risks probably fall victims nervous alarms kind injudicious training parents guardians 
pondered subject deeply impressed become great importance well mankind profoundly engrossed companions utterly failed engage general conversation walked briskly along forest 
jack attempted draw attention splendor curious specimens tropical foliage vegetation passed could rouse take interest therein 
vain peterkin jest rally point monkeys grinned us ever anon passed beneath serpents glided path fascinated train meditation could give thought pass subject least endeavored guard misconception 
beg understood means inculcate hare brained recklessness course training foster state mind 
contrary course training like see universally practiced would naturally tend counteract recklessness would enable boy judge correctly could could 
take illustration 
naturally bold boy unwisely trained exceedingly careful 
know extent courage power agility muscles knows things extent indeed owing restraint know fully 
hence liable estimate 
bold boy shall call tom takes walk country friend shall name pat

thus commenced journey desert plain africa end many weeks found approaching part country near equator gorilla said dwell 
way many adventures amusing dangerous character made many additions collection animals besides making number valuable interesting notes journal constrained pass order introduce reader regions wonderful adventures occurred 
one two things however must omit mention 
passing desert suffered much want water 
frequently poor oxen travel two three days without tasting drop distress great thought turning adrift first good watering place come proceed formerly foot recovered wonted vigor quite capable standing fatigues journey well men 
several times found country destitute game reduced point starvation continued keep oxen lest require food

several days absolutely without drop water reduced mouthful two per man day 
could exist much longer without life giving fluid jack dismounted placing load one men ox back sent advance look water 
morning seen footprints several animals fond water never found great distance spot may found

fair lady saved possibly fight niggers lion elephant rhinoceros alligator hippopotamus buffalo shooting way relaxation intervals war chapter fifteen 
unexpected meeting fly make narrow escape appalling fate 
many days incidents narrated last chapter jack peterkin makarooroo push across continent bush brake hill dale morass plain utmost possible speed 
whole course journey overtake portuguese slave dealer thought little probable hit upon exactly route entertained sanguine hopes energy speed kept steadily undeviatingly way would enable us reach village mbango slave dealer party 
look back upon time reflect calmly dangers encountered hardships endured confess filled amazement 
might easily fill several volumes anecdotes encounters wild animals adventures however interesting might must forget main incidents sojourn africa yet related limit patience even youthful readers 
power enduring fatigue sustained active exertion comparatively short intervals nightly repose much greater could believed possible 
doubt anxiety save okandaga terrible fate hung enabled us bear fatigues would times overcome us 
know well kept strong agile comrades 
oftentimes felt ready drop walked yet somehow never thought falling behind went doggedly nights found little worse condition 
peterkin although small tough springy spirits seemed rather rise otherwise strength abated 
jack never saw one like 
seemed like lion roaming strength native deserts 
hardened become course travels found equal makarooroo pedestrian powers superior occasion required could almost knock free admit never succeeded thoroughly 
short nearly possible equal exception jack seemed every way invulnerable 
long hurried intensely interesting delightful journey came upon different times almost every species animal plant tree peculiar african continent 
oftentimes passed droves herds elephants deer buffalo giraffes antelopes zebras saw rhinoceroses alligators leopards lions apes several kinds smaller monkeys innumerable 
also saw great numbers birds curious account habits form others beautiful bright rainbow 
yet although said journey delightful feelings different times exceedingly varied unfrequently pained saw around us much beautiful innocent lovely also witnessed conflicts many wild creatures sometimes came across evidences savage cruel dispositions human beings country peopled 
always however carefully avoided native villages anxious interrupted forced march 
neither turn aside hunt although much tempted contented killing animals required daily subsistence shot many required without turn aside straight course 
thus went day day slept shade trees wide canopy heaven night night arrived one day beautiful valley bordered plain traversed river peterkin met sad accident onward progress short period arrested 
happened thus region chanced passing peopled many natives utmost difficulty avoiding compelled halt daytime sequestered dell resume journey night 
one day remember rightly two clock afternoon came suddenly sight native village banks river whose course time following made wide detour order avoid 
passed several miles gradually bending course came unexpectedly upon band natives hunting returning village spoils chase shoulders 
parties came abrupt halt stood several minutes looking natives speechless amazement conversed whispers uncertain 
knew made friendly advances doubt welcomed certainly compelled go back village spend least day two could hope give satisfactory reason going 
also knew go spite would produce quarrel course fight would certainly result bloodshed means avoided could bear think mere caprice visiting africa means causing death single human could prevent 
done said peterkin looking jack despair 
know replied jack 
awkward 
never go way back village stupid fellows tell real reason going first place would perhaps believe us second place might offer join us 
fight said makarooroo low tone grinding teeth together clutching rifle 
felt deep sympathy poor fellow knew well disposition naturally reverse quarrelsome present state mind consequence anxiety deliverance faithful bride

true forgot 
see yonder blue mountain peak let us meet 
miss base let us proceed summit wait 
away jack uttered last word turned right fled like wind 
savages instantly set hideous yell darted us made thick woods scattering directions previously arranged speedily threw scent finally made escape 
first time since landing continent africa found totally alone wild forest 
separating companions ran utmost speed direction dense jungle purposed taking shelter natives pass come pursue way leisurely 
prevented adopting course consequence two fleet negroes discovering intention taking short cut frustrating 
compelled therefore keep open part forest trust simply speed endurance escape 
think ran nearly two miles full speed kept well ahead pursuers 
indeed distanced considerably feeling could hold long killing pace pulled little allowed gain slightly 
resume full speed possible throw far behind foot caught thorny shrub fell headlong ground 
completely stunned moment two lay quite motionless 
consciousness suddenly returned accompanied feeling imminent danger caused spring renew headlong career 
glancing shoulder saw two natives gained much lain seconds longer must inevitably captured 
exerted beyond powers 
head shock received became confused scarce knew whither going 
presently loud dull roar distant thunder struck upon ear beheld appeared vast white plain covered mist 
next moment found brink precipice hundred feet deep little left large river fell thundered dark abyss whence issued clouds spray taken white plain confusion brain vision

found greater part men assembled well timed jack movements one able overtake slay single enemy 
thus able generalship jack gained complete bloodless victory 
detached sent scouts besides picked men traveled without encumbrance arms resumed journey homeward reached village long sunrise immense surprise jambai could scarcely believe routed enemy completely whose scepticism increased total unaccountable absence prisoners trophies success fight 
jack made public speech elaborate deeply mysterious totally incomprehensible character even makarooroo translated listened spoke deepest reverence wonder concluded evidently firm impression minds natives victory means way quite inexplicable highly satisfactory greatest ever achieved 
king agreed jack proposal grand pursuit take place commence instant news brought scouts

tis always thus added sigh man preys upon man monkey upon monkey 
yet hoped better things jack 
believed least refined species gorilla

last offer jack deemed great stroke politic wisdom thereby secured pending war marked shedding less blood normal cases 
endeavored secure end assuring king balls would useless purpose made substance put gun along would accomplish great end putting enemy flight fired one tremendous volley time foe idea presence enemy

something inexpressibly horrible sight great block head mischievous looking eyes ungainly snout ponderous horn close proximity friend 
got near without heavy tread heard tell unless noise turbulent brook drowned sound 
time either speculation contemplation 
jack instantly took aim shoulder afterwards told monster eye bound confess usual precipitancy discharged barrels 
report seemed effect arousing peterkin state fascination sprang darted towards us 
instant wounded rhinoceros crossed spot left terrific rush bursting bushes great rock falling mountain cliff went headlong rivulet 
without moving spot stood recharged pieces degree celerity persuaded never equalled 
peterkin time caught rifle leaned tree hard seconds elapsed fall monster river ere upon banks ready another shot

drawing near struggling monster observed really case 
blood streamed eye fired poured hideous jaws dyeing water floundered 
look cried jack springing right order get animal blind side succeeded effecting landing 
peterkin instantly sprang direction bounded opposite side 
never able satisfactorily decide mind whether act part performed consequence sudden almost involuntary idea help distract creature attention result merely accidental impulse 
whatever cause effect fortunate rhinoceros turned towards thus blind eye lost sight jack peterkin rapidity almost thought leaped close side took close aim vulnerable parts body

chapter twenty three 
see strange things give negro friends slip 
two following days passed country thickly covered indiarubber vine place met african travels 
could help feeling regret splendid region almost altogether unknown useless civilised man 
seemed unlimited supply caoutchouc natives practiced method gathering effect destroying vine 
one day weeks came upon habitation remarkable species monkey named nshiego mbouve often heard time fortunate see 
exceedingly anxious observe remarkable creature made use singular house peterkin lay near place secreting bushes patiently awaited arrival monkey jack went another direction procure something supper

forbearance time afterwards repaid obtaining two much finer specimens shelter building ape killed peterkin 
quitting place narrow escape recollection still fills horror 
walking rapidly back towards encampment chatting went peterkin suddenly put foot appeared dead branch tree
