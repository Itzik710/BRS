therefore different notions remuneration case poor fool met case 
however unappalled bad names goth vandal forth shall honestly lay reader notions 
dryden wrote famous indeed matchless epigram upon three great masters reputed masters epopee found loss characterize last triad matter qualities imputed first second knew safe imputing third

greek orators 
let us come orators 
isocrates eldest survived mere scholastic rhetorician timid man dare confront terrors stormy political audience hence though lived entire century never addressed athenian citizens 
true although bon fide orator never spoke usual acceptation word consequence never opportunity replying bring forward man talents debater still employed pen upon real upon existing questions public policy many generations chamber rhetoricians continued greece confine powers imaginary cases political difficulty tantamount imaginary cases fetched long past era king priam still earlier era seven chiefs warring seven gated thebes boeotia half fabulous era argonauts 
isocrates man sense patriot temperate way something feeling greece generally merely champion athens 
heart given politics age heavy clouds gathering independence civil grandeur country disinterested anxiety drawing lightning approaching storms pacific counsels 
compared therefore common mercenary orators athenian forum made regular trade promoting mischief inflaming pride jealousy vengeance martial instincts fierce democracy generally speaking views high low sound unsound looked beyond momentary profit thus pandering thoughtless nationality sensitive people isocrates entitled respect 
writings also separate value memorials political transactions historian gathered many useful hints perhaps diligent search might yield 
considered orator title propriety allowed one declaimed closet one relation public affairs england speaking practical jurisprudence call chamber counsel isocrates languid little anything characteristic manner justify separate consideration 
remarkable beyond rhetoricians era cultivated rhythmus periods 
object sacrificed enormity time doubt many cases freedom natural movement thoughts 
reason however noticing peculiarity isocrates way fixing attention upon superiority even artificial ornaments downright practical business realities political strife torpid atmosphere study school 
cicero long passion numerositas full pompous rotundity cadence 
cicero habits faculties nursed daily practice life impassioned realities forum senate 
consequence whereas labored performance isocrates cost think one whole decennium period ten years modern ears sensible striking art great result harmony cicero hand fine sonorous modulations periodic style delightful dullest ear european 
advantages real campaigns unsimulated strife actual stormy life torpid dreams romans called umbratic experience

perhaps elsewhere drawn attention readers peculiar effects climate shaping modes thinking imaging 
life inertia retreats dust toil actual experience represent idea effeminacy naturally image shrinking cold call chimney corner fireside experience romans effeminacy easily fell idea shrinking heat sun called experience shade mere scholastic student called umbraticus doctor 
isocrates noticed oldest surviving greek orators demosthenes course claims notice emphatically universal consent athens afterwards rhodes rome impartial judges greatest least comprehensively great 
way must forgotten though modern critics forget rather important fact weighing reputation demosthenes esteemed day greatest particular quality energy demoniac power greek deinot generally assumed leading characteristic forte comparison compatriots even cicero greatest men roman bar 
demosthenes athenians accustomed say thunders lightens pericles elder orator even amongst written oratory greece still survives speeches ascribed pericles thucydides take granted usual mere forgeries historian portion perhaps exceeds demosthenes naked quality vehemence 
admit impeach supremacy probable wherever orator characterised exclusively turbulent power least remembered chiefly quality numerous graces eloquence wanting man existed degree made equipoise insulated gift jovian terror 
gracchi amongst roman orators probably properly sons thunder crassus cicero even c sar whose oratory way respect like character infinite accomplishments even cicero rarely cited without epithet splendid magnificent c must suppose therefore neither cicero demosthenes held head respective fields rome athens right absolute pre eminence one leading power orator viz 
native fervent vigor right large comprehensive harmony gifts leaving possibly orators elder rival superiority orator talents taken apart claiming supremacy nevertheless upon whole systematic union many qualities tending one result pleasing taste harmonious coup oeil total assemblage also adapting far larger variety situations mere son thunder disarmed apt become ridiculous strip passionate cause theme saturated human strife excitable tempestuous audience 
audience however said demosthenes sometimes often orations survive theme 
audience certainly could wished point violence combustible passion also something 
mighty advantage doubtless orator sees hears kindling passions instantaneously reflected blazing eyes fiery shouts fremitus audience sees whole people personally deputation swayed backwards forwards like field corn breeze movements appeals 
unfortunately athenian audience ignorance headstrong violence prejudice arrogance levity national mind presented orator favorite scene like ocean always rocking storms like wasp always angry like lunatic always coming passion preparing go one 
well might demosthenes prepare sea shore practice conceive purpose must much according common notion overcrow noise forum stand fire may express uproarious demonstrations mob fury 
quality athenian audience must seriously interfered intellectual display orator 
word could venture say way censure towards public even hypothetically insinuate fault syllable could utter even way dissent favorite speculations moment 
instantly roar menaces recalled sense even personal danger 
mere vivacity audience requiring perpetual amusement variety compelled man great even demosthenes curtail arguments rarely indeed pursue theme requisite fulness development illustration point superior dignity far less fluctuating mobility roman mind gave immense advantage cicero 
demosthenes spite weaknesses arrayed memory hatred contemporaries anti republican feelings men mitford great man honest man 
rose countrymen 
despised measure audience length palmy days influence would insist heard would insist telling truth however unacceptable would like great rout venal haranguers lay flattering unction capital distempers public mind would point errors warn perils 
upright character man victorious constitutional timidity brightly illustrate local law tyranny public feeling 
often find brink uttering odious truth obliged pause propitiate audience deprecatory phrases entreating give time utterance yell heard sentence end 
greek thoryzeite gentlemen athens love god make uproar going say gentlemen athens humbly beseech let finish sentence continual appeals better feelings audience 
evident circumstances man could justice subject 
least speaking tribunal justice people council assembled effect greatest stage demosthenes however bold times restive matter held paramount required bend bend local genius democracy reinforced mercurial temperament 
air attica combined great political power kept natives state habitual intoxication even wise men would difficulty mastering affected permanent bias towards caprice insolence 
state things taken account modern critiques upon demosthenes upshot find modern lecturers upon rhetoric style french english speaking demosthenes notable simile way representing final effect eloquence like mountain torrent swollen melting snow rain carries things 
prodigiously original exceedingly discriminative illustration would equally represent effect lyrical poem mozart music stormy chorus form whatever impassioned vehemence 
meantime suspect grievously one critics ever read paragraph demosthenes 
nothing ever find quoted notorious passages philip macedon famous oath manes died marathon 
call famous like addison comparison marlborough blenheim angel storm schoolmaster living said nine every ten boys would hit upon school exercise peculiar boldness must occurred every athenian sensibility every day life 
hear hand modern oath remarkable oath sworn pulpit 
dissenting clergyman believe baptist preaching cambridge occasion affirm deny something upon general confidence grandeur man nature magnificence conceptions immensity aspirations c delivered thus greatness human ideals greatness human aspirations immortality human creations iliad odyssey bold startling sublime 
case neither oath invested great pomp imagery expression purpose oath representative peculiar manner belonging demosthenes 
always rude inartificial style criticism cite author whether fine fair specimen ordinary style 
characteristic style demosthenes one grew naturally defects mean faults omission contradiction positive composition audience 
audience comprehending much ignorance much high spirited impatience fact always fret kept orator always fret 
hence arose short sentences hence impossibility long voluminous sweeps beautiful rhythmus find cicero hence animated form apostrophe crowded interrogations addressed audience

contrary necessity rousing attention sustaining obliged attic orator rely much personality direct question audience use brief sentences also impatient fretful irritability forbade linger much upon idea theorise speculate generally quit direct business path question consideration matter purpose beauty dignity instruction even ultimate effect 
things immediate instant pr sens pr sentissimum kept steadily eye athenian orator mere coercion self interest 
hence way arises one important feature distinction grecian oratory political oratory least one hand roman point may add british 
roman lawyer senator demagogue even proper restrictions british member parliament even candidate hustings assuredly evidence many splendid example advocate addressing jury may embellish oration wide circuit historical antiquarian nay even speculative discussion 
every latin scholar remember leisurely facetious good natured respectful yet keenly satiric picture great roman barrister draws stoic philosophy way rowing old cato professed philosophy little indulgence venial human errors

senate need say much farther frequently habit large generalisation liberal excursion perhaps lifeless theme carried great masters particular edmund burke carried fact excess point threatened much disturb movement public business cause perhaps rude insensibility value speculations put audience sometimes motion dinner acquired well known surname dinner bell 
footnote yet story exaggerated believe strict truth whole case arose fretful expressions ill temper part burke name retort man wit personally stung sarcasm offended orator 
athenian audience impossible neither political forensic harangues license rule indulgence usage special privilege personal favor least effort improving individual case law politics general views jurisprudence statesmanship diplomacy collateral discussions tolerated illustrative details historical parallelisms still less philosophical moralisations 
slightest show tendency directions summarily nipped bud athenian gentlemen began greek thoryzein good earnest man showed symptoms entering upon discussion whatever intensely needful pertinent first place second place nature wound two sentences summons arise either dinner theater succession variety anticipated another orator 
hence therefore finally arises one great peculiarity greek eloquence unfortunate one chance ever influencing remote posterity substantial sense ever surviving real unaffected admiration us moderns embodies alien collateral information manners usages modes feeling extrinsic ornament side glimpses grecian life casual historical details 
cause nothing cause political question nothing question pealed ever ears terrified orator always sufferance always good behavior always afraid sake party client lest auditors become angry become impatient become weary 
intense fear trammeling freedom steps every turn overruling every motion right left pure servile anxiety mood disposition tyrannical master arose opposite result us day means adopted prevent weariness immediate auditors find nothing surviving grecian orations weary us insupportably want general interest even amongst private instant details politics law presenting us none throw light upon spirit manners grecian peculiarities feeling 
probably athenian mob would cared much prospect result posterity rate would sacrificed one atom ease pleasure obviate result athenian orator result would sad one contemplate 
final consequence whilst men find may find infinite amusement instruction liberal kind accomplished statesmen orators roman cicero nay would doubtless causes assigned found proportion attractions speeches elder antony hortensius crassus contemporaries immediate predecessors cicero person ever reads demosthenes still less athenian orator slightest interest beyond inevitably attaches words one wrote divine language probably superior skill

mr malthus shaped argument whether wrong right would offended point logic logical error lies supposing state perfection already existing yet brought nothing excess births whereas clear excess may operate prevent operate destroy state perfection state excess could ever arise though excess may co exist vast increase moral restraint co exist entire perfect moral restraint nothing less involved term perfection

rewards punishments 
already mentioned corporal punishments entirely abolished upon principle disgrace would destroy self respect 
expulsion even resorted rather boy submitted treatment might lead school fellows forget gentleman 
think experimentalist wise precisely upon ground mr coleridge lectures royal institution attacked mr lancaster system deviated madras system chiefly complexity details pressing cruelly punishments upon principle shame 
public disgrace experimentalist alleges p painful exactly proportion good feeling offender thus good heavily punished bad 
confinement certain disabilities severest punishments former rare possible attended unavoidable disgrace punishment wholly free objection unlike labor pain without utility p 
ordinary punishments therefore consist forfeiture rewards certain counters obtained various kinds merit 
two classes penal called received forfeits premial obtained higher degree merit higher powers attached 
premial counters purchase holidays also purchase rank system great importance 
conflict thus created pleasure ambition generally terminates favor latter boy fourteen although constantly possession marks sufficient obtain holiday per week bought three quarters day relaxation whole last year

voluntary labor took rise necessity furnishing boys chance obtaining rank talents means distinguishing accomplished two modes first giving rewards industry exerted school hours receiving rewards price rank making stipulation one addition tolerably well executed viz

take care says reward boy fragments whatever may excellence 
know nothing exertions come us state completion 
hence besides gaining habit finishing early youth boy interest also gaining habit measuring powers knows receive neither fame profit instalments therefore undertakes nothing rational hope accomplishing

amount chapter write good running hand main object aimed art caligraphy go farther concede sole object unless pupil educated writing master 
thus far agreed question best means attaining object 
question plan proposed differs use natural error admitted ultimate object plan would make immediate object 
author starts false theory practice amongst writing masters order pupils may write small running hands well writing masters well known begin exacting long praxis large hands 
rationale praxis escapes experimentalist large hand small hand stand related estimate masters means end whereas experimentalist supposes viewed relation simply two co ordinate collateral ends false presumption grounds would view sound advice justly conceiving small hand incomparably use life argues effect thus let us communicate main object leisure taste let pupil direct attention lower object running hand accomplished says pupil may thought necessary learn write larger hands according received models 
acquired aye order may acquired writing master reply must first teach larger hands 
well might professor dancing hold tempting innovation public teach actual dances true practical synthesis steps movements fact demanded usage ball room let others teach analytic elements art mere useless steps time waste superfluities 
either art many others first rather sole order importance last order attainment object per se larger hand wanted either running hand really contribute nothing accurate formation letters compelling pupil exhibit aberrations ideal letter clearly scale greater magnitude yet second sentence chapter experimentalist admits let abandoned service nothing 
hand specific service clear object per se simply means object must precedency order communication 
innovation experimentalist far literal sense word preposterous inversion old usage chief principle plan desire know sorry p found declining enter detail 
business chapter finished however yet remains little matter curiosity 

experimentalist affirms langford copper plate copies indeed seen fail tried certain test test large hand seen diminishing glass ought reduced current hand current hand magnified ought swell large hand 
whereas contrary large hands reduced appear stiff cramped magnified running hand appears little better scrawl 
us result appears different light 
true large hands reduced appear good running hands according standard derived actual practice world simply good e ideals fact meant nothing characteristic purely generic hands therefore want individualisation abstractions affect us pleasurably concrete expressions human qualities moral intellectual 
perfect features human face arranged perfect symmetry affect us well known nothing characteristic latency individual generic generic individual gives power human sensibilities 
holds caligraphy less arts 
perfect hand writing unites minimum deviation ideal standard beauty form nexus letters maximum characteristic expression 
long practically felt even expressly affirmed instances even expanded distinct art professed possible determine human intellectual character features hand writing 
books even written art e g ideographia art knowing characters men hand writings aldorisius though common modes physiognomy craniology lavaterianism usually called physiognomy c c labored reproach fancifulness yet ought attribute wholly groundlessness art possible art two causes partly precipitation imperfect psychology professors like craniologists ready determine indicantia settled according tolerable theory indicanda e settled b c shall indicate inquired presumable upon systematic development human nature would right indicated thus assigned external characteristic faculty third order suppose perhaps mere accidental effect faculty mere imaginary faculty whilst primary faculty went without expression partly say cause obviously merely subjective also accidental cause partly also following cause objective e seated inherent imperfections art removeable therefore future improvements anticipated matured psychology viz 
human mind transcends overflows gamut scale art words qualities intellectual moral ought expressed far number alphabet signs expressions enunciated 
hence follows inevitable dilemma many qualities must go unrepresented else represented signs common qualities first cases art imperfect defect case imperfect equivocal language 
thus example determination character built cases upon mere energy moral cause cases upon capaciousness judgment freedom logical perplexity intellectual cause 
yet possible either cause modify hand writing way 
long analysis thus given book recording new system education sufficiently evident think highly 
hands founder convinced calculated work wonders strong impression book conveys man extraordinary talents improvement science education also conscientious man parts confide child care spirit perfect confidence described p 
air gentlemanly feeling spread book tends still recommend author 
meantime two questions arise system first good system answered secondly system adapted general diffusion question dare answer affirmative unless could ensure talents energy original inventor every superintendent system 
may wrong events ought considered deduction merits author original thinker science education system like madras system independent teacher ability therefore unconditionally applicable 
upon future occasion shall perhaps take opportunity stating opinion great desideratum still supplied art education considered simply intellectual purposes viz 
communication knowledge development intellectual faculties purposes yet treated sufficient insulation moral purposes

one spirit reads memory another spirit representations whether images ideas contains 
thus spirits see swedenborg representations world clear intuition often deceive fancy see objects immediately however impossible since pure spirit slightest perception material universe nay gain idea intercourse souls living men inner nature opened e inner sense contains none obscure representations

first question arises upon true originators proximate immediate mutiny question ploughs deeper moves impulse mere historic curiosity practically main question 
knowing true instant operative cause already know something remedy sure information ringleaders enabled read motives past anticipate policy future persons indicated first incited encouraged felonious agents shorten course public vengeance vast field action give true direction first pursuit headed indian police 
never laid sight rebels whose least offence rebellion men massacred torture women children service extermination belongs right executioners armed whips rods lassos south america noosing noosed halters hang 
made known proclamation sepoys de jure strict interpretation principle concerned hunted hangman british army whilst obliged vast scale outrages join hangman chase feel dishonoured called work properly inheritance gallows yet become reconciled work purgation earth polluted blood innocent 
footnote hang constant notification hanging criminals would decapitated otherwise threat loses sting 
seems superstition universal amongst southern asiatics unless possibly amongst malay race suffer dismemberment body operates disastrously upon fate unseen world 
hence doubt arisen gallows viewed light degrading punishment 
immunity mutilation compensates ignominy might else attend 
accordingly see china innumerable victims present rebellion captured vast province quantung cruel yeh beheaded sword blood reeking privacies canton

namely th december looking india say th november entitled something weightier

tempers vary obduracy circumstances vary

know secretly perfect trustworthiness british government 
matters come case choice wife children one scale fraternity consciously criminal may judged likely prevail 
coercion mere circumstances entreaties wife children co operating circumstances sometimes weakness nature relenting compunction doubted cohesion party begins rapidly relax approaching ruin confessions abundance 
yet timid policy sepoys hardly ever venturing cover either skulking amongst bushy woodlands sneaking house shelter slinking back within range great guns naturally happened prisoners exceedingly

ultimate purpose main strategic policy transcendent interests riding narrow counsels fell knowledge illiterate soldier since part requisite fulfilment man separate duty part would communicated 
barely possible much light may confessions combined much light may supposed lurk amongst mass unexamined papers left behind rebels delhi might tell us something important

case shall learn nothing confessions must upon principle mere self preservation excluded real knowledge dreadful scheme made parties simply perpetrators murders outrages 
equally vain look revelations mercenary workers know nothing elevated leaders know interest life death dissembling knowledge 
revelations value reveal ambitious schemes communicated alike hopeless 
default let us examine one incident class incidents course horrors may made self revelation silent significant revelation pointing attention men true authors simultaneously final purposes mysterious conspiracy 
escaped notice many people two extraordinary classes outrages perpetrated attempted marked large majority mutinous explosions outrages last degree unnatural harmony whole temper spirit intercourse generally prevailing sepoys british officers 
case peculiarly striking 
reproach character manners ever alleged british officers section subdivision sepoy soldiery 
indeed reproach existed ran opposite channel 
great indulgence sepoy spirit concession facile whims caprices generally relaxed state discipline features british bearing towards native soldiery often reasonably provoked severe censures observing 
case adduced months back intelligent british officer course evidence court martial mentioned illustration decaying discipline considerable space time noticed growing disrespect part privates particular coming cantonments regiment men ceased rise seats took notice presence one anecdote sufficiently exemplified quality errors prevailing deportment countrymen native soldiery would ludicrous charge harshness severity manner 
notoriously case whence could possibly arise bloody carnage almost every case sepoys inaugurated tried inaugurate emancipation british rule continental neighbors first grossly misinterpreted case excusably many misinterpretations 
certainly unavoidable first read frenzy bloodshed vindictive retaliations men suffered horrible ineffable indignities hands 
apparently old case african slaves west indian colony st domingo instance breaking loose yoke murdering often cruel torments whole households oppressors 
month dissipated groundless commentaries 
prejudiced frenchman could fail observe sepoy regiment ever alluded rigor treatment haughtiness demeanor 
complaints centred one sole subject religion even generally pretend certain knowledge simply strong belief persuasion secretly meditated openly avowed deliberately pursued purpose coercing christianity 
even true though false erroneous policy could taxed ill 
man religion sincerely profoundly believes truth 
seeking inoculate another sincerely believes eminently truth though proceeding false methods man acts spirit benignity 
hands hellish fury sepoy felt unnatural artificially assumed reasonable inference held mask something else wished conceal 
something else wished conceal sepoy simulated order might dissimulate 
pretended wrong sustained might call away attention wrong designed 
point doubt company multitudes beside watched case became sensible alien presence secretly intruding pretended quarrel native soldier 
sepoy moving center feud objects towards ultimately tended could possibility interest poor miserable idolatrous native 
gain overthrow british government poor simpleton decoyed monstrous field strife opened game renouncing vast advantages children hundredth generation might draw system company entered upon career towards distant objects absolutely meaning intelligible existence 
point two enigmas previously insoluble suddenly received fullest explanation 
meaning hellish fury suddenly developed towards officers previously sepoy lived terms reciprocal amity 
cause led incomprehensible enmity manifested process ferocious scenes towards wives children officers surely wish eliminate families indian territory purpose sufficiently secured massacre whose exertions obtained livelihood rest household 
footnote case entirely misapprehended journalist happened extract passage

tolerably certain widows children would remain much longer indian territory longer offered asylum livelihood 
since personally viewed apart husbands ladies could interest murdering sepoys became unintelligible principle steady motive fugitive impulse incarnate demons could persist cherishing feeling whatever poor ruined women anchorage cut away murder husbands would become mere waifs derelicts stranded upon indian shores 
seemed first two separate mysteries less hard decipher primal mystery mutiny 
became clear whatsoever might composition character final objects tyranny decoyed sepoys yoke one thing certain namely childishness levity hindoo sepoy made difficult excess gain lasting hold mind consequently count upon lasting services 
general difficulty supervened one signal aggravation shape hateful encountered namely attractions british service service would sooner abjured would passionately regretted 
lay rock threatened free movement insurrection 
evidently determined meant appropriate services sepoys retreat opening recovering false step well known mercy british government 
resolved locus penitenti left open 
order close ever avenue hope forgiveness misleaders soldiery urged atrocities every nation upon earth heard horror 
mere fact atrocities indicates overruling influence men nena sahib determined place bar everlasting separation native army government might else reclaimed erring men offences lain within reach lawful forgiveness 
conspirators thus divorced ruling power idly flattered martial resources doubtless assumed work revolution already finished midsummer day present year 
account course attempted revolution traveled according sepoys could ambition implied attempt indian princes rajahs standing background true originators movement finds indirect justification accuracy natural solution furnishes infernal massacres else must remain ever without parallel also remain ever without intelligible motive 
atrocities exacted sepoys conclave princes tests sincerity 
doubtless argument exaction ostensible plea put forward miserable reptiles seduced treason promise doubt sharing fruits new mighty revolution 
pleas sepoy 
secret benefit princely seducer needed could obtain accursed acts means sure sudden making separation soldier government irreparable 
much massacre officers different reason availed diabolical outrages upon women children 
murder men extorted sepoy kind sacrifice 
reptile lived upon terms humanising intercourse vile many cases must slowly ripened mode regard involuntary esteem murdering man oftentimes sepoy making real trifling sacrifice 
females cared nothing 
opinion perished different principle 
male murders levied pledges benefit princes distinctly understood levied wishes sepoy 
female sacrifice parties concurred sepoy prince tempted tempter alike 
require murder officer pledge real hostility else might pure pretence government 
murder officer wife child rested motive totally different namely throughout hindostan feature moral aspects british nature could conspicuous impressive tenacity purpose persistency dogged resolution never relax grasp taken 
consequently men nation separately women scattered land long done china instance perhaps natives finding conflict well known principle imperishable tenacity would liable sentiment despair contest fate 
sentiment would paralyse hindoos entering upon struggle unrooting british hindostan 
suddenly woman steps aid hindoo 
briton notorious would never loosen hold compatriot bull dog 
scene man faced steadily upon account shrinks husband father 
hence sepoy attacks upon women children 
hurried writing feared may done slight justice views 
let conclude head therefore briefly resuming 
argument tracing back great conspiracy discontented rajahs otherwise supposing mutiny raised objects specially affecting sepoys would massacred officers 
must desired leave opening pardon event failure 
crime exacted compromise native army effectually government 
many ways sure operate ruinously sepoy interests could therefore found sufficient motive native princes 
female sacrifice welcome parties 
doubt represented british officer saying long danger affected would never relaxed hold india war threatens women children india longer home us 
another urgent question concerns acts bengal government 
many unfounded charges case infinite confusion hourly pressure must aimed governor general probability charges multiplied experience charges makes reasonable men cautious fact unduly excess caution reacts upon lord canning estimation advantageously 
lord dalhousie missed energy would shown conspicuously time 
surely case negotiation bahadoor jung nepaul ghoorkas doubt present though great doubt unfairly indulgent lord canning encouraged first imbecile oscillation governed calcutta counsels 
settled oscillation turned entirely upon petty personal motive 
subordinate officer accepted nepaul offer unauthorised acceptance intruded upon prerogative lord canning 
cause jealous punctiliousness exacting vanity wish enforce severities public justice interfered set aside proclamation mr colvin agra 
insufficiency steps taken nena sahib speaks language 
journal full six weeks earlier calcutta proclamation offer large sum man head suggested 
offer never kept sufficiently public eye 
grosser neglect affecting condition many thousands single villain non employment press pursuing steps mutineers 
everywhere fast appeared strength brief handbills circulated circumstantially relating defeats exposing false pretences describing prospects 
government attempted service blundered far urge sepoys reproach must unintelligible native readers 
footnote imperfectly offer advertised seems considerable effect 
apparently extinguished nena power show move freedom 
distrustful jealous often doubt little reason 
question even practical instant arises modes public vengeance 

finally defeated military sense destroyed signal field battle mutineers fly hills great ranges jungle main fear would arise weak compromising government would show eager treat make roman law calls transactio half half settlement body sepoys showed considerable strength 
case besides rebels delhi scanty ammunition best resource would found spanish bloodhounds cuba british used fifty years back hunting poor negro maroons jamaica thousand degrees criminal sepoys 

wrong done bengal government anticipation eventual compromise may judged assertion resting apparently adequate authority even hour government making subject deliberation doubt whether sepoys forfeited pensions doubtless delhi cawnpore exploits merit good service pensions life 
others millions come questions far nobler spirit fear rate every advantage righteous judgment many worst sepoys laden booty may find means escape 
would suggest appropriate worst hellish punishments hellish malefactors mortification utter ruin every one schemes 
thrust bayonet deepest sabre cuts moments 
others rejoiced therefore many escaped delhi prolonged torment
