go across bridge tomorrow talk master fletcher 
sooner apprenticed sooner time since madge married eight years since lonely house shall glad 
geoffrey ward found friend ready accede request walter apprenticed expected 
bowyer indeed quiet man high spirits somewhat turbulent disposition young charge gave much uneasiness sorry responsibility keeping order undertaken geoffrey 
moreover could agree argument promise prince wales offered favourable opportunity walter enter upon career arms perhaps someday win way back rank honors could looked 
therefore following week walter indentured armourer usual time left abode aldgate took residence master 
threw whole heart work time fifteen way become skilful craftsman

never abated practice arms every day work master long bout together cudgel quarterstaff sword axe walter course used light weapons quick geoffrey ward acknowledged needed put skill hold pupil 
alone geoffrey walter opportunity learning use arms 
whenever soldier returned wars came weapon repaired armourer would sure invitation come evening take stoup ale tell battles sieges gone course evening would asked bout arms young apprentice geoffrey represented eager learn use sword well make 
thus walter became accustomed different styles fighting found indeed visitors nearly well skilled arms master 
soldiers mortified finding unable hold boy others would take reverses good part would come bringing comrade known particularly skilled weapons try temper armourer apprentice 
age fifteen walter prize sports best cudgel play best sword buckler play among apprentices great disgust many almost reached age manhood time 
sundays walter always spent day giles fletcher wife going mass walking fields service citizens much congregated 
since walter gone work taken part fights frolics former comrades fact far tired end day work desire aught sit listen tales wars many old soldiers pervaded country 
men disabled wounds long service greater portion idle scamps cared hard blows sufferings campaign liking better hang taverns drinking expense related fabulous tales gallant actions performed 
many wandered country sometimes twos threes sometimes large bands robbing often murdering travelers attacking lonely houses 
one part another ill deeds became notorious sheriffs would call posse men would hunted like wild beasts 
however easy catch great tracts forests still covered large portion country afforded shelter 
country round london pests numerous anywhere else chance plunder 
swamps south side river especially evil reputation 
southwark putney stretches marshy country high tides river frequently flowed 
wretched huts difficult access affording good hiding places pursued justice since searchers could seen approaching long way escape could made paths across swamp known dwellers heavily armed men dared follow 
south wild country round westerham miles heath forest stretched away directions another noted place robber vagrants mustered thickly sheriff kent much trouble 
laws days extremely severe death penalty caught plundering 
extreme severity laws however operated favor breakers since sympathy people little lose unless caught red handed act could generally escape since none save robbed would say aught would place pursuers traces give testimony would cost life fellow creature 
citizens london loud complaints discharged soldiers upon loss mainly fell petitions king sheriffs middlesex hertford essex surrey kent generally stirred put ill doers 
sometimes hunts conducted wholesale way whole posse county would called 
found within limits land visible occupation collected 
charges could brought home hung without ado rest put board ship sent across sea army 
sometimes found country becoming hot men would take service knight noble going war anxious take strong following might particular character soldiers 
walter adventurous spirit sometimes wont summer evening work done wander across marshes taking bow arrows often bringing home wild duck two shot pools 
surly men accosted threatened knock head found wandering way walter laughed threats seeing though apprentice lad might able send arrow straight mark another content leave alone 
one day well nigh heart swamp lambeth saw figure making way across 
hour already late night falling appearance man different usual denizens swamp walter wondered business might 
scarcely knowing walter threw among low brushwood watched approaching figure 
came near recognized face saw surprise knight day stopped armourer shop two rivets put hauberk 
particularly noticed arrogant manner spoke 
walter put rivets thought buckled armor unpleasant countenance wearer 
tall powerful man would handsome eyes closely set together nose narrow expression face reminded walter hawk 
laid aside helmet figure covered long cloak 
good walter said dealings could knight honestly ruffians haunt swamps 
assuredly business mine may lead adventure real fun since left aldgate 
follow see get bottom mystery

pest upon swamps quagmires knight said angrily neared

see none said may mistaken light waning fast 
ill anyone caught prying 
come sir knight hovel lordship accustomed may well talk beneath sky 
two men disappeared walter sight 
latter much surprise crept forward reached spot last seen speakers unable account disappearance 
saw spot although apparently mere clump bushes higher surrounding country really elevated hummock ground 
anyone might passed close bushes without suspecting aught lay among 
center however ground cut away low doorway almost hidden bushes gave access half subterranean hut roof formed old boat turned bottom upwards covered brown turf 
excellent place concealment searchers might passed within foot bushes without suspecting aught lay concealed within 
clever hiding place walter thought 
wonder posse search swamps vain 
lowest wettest part swamp would lightly searched none would suspect human habitation among brown ditches stagnant pools 
disappointment lad could hear nothing conversation going within hut 
murmur voices came ear words audible however remained patiently thinking perhaps came word might said would give clue object mysterious interview knight one evidently fugitive justice 
patience rewarded

always handy times like able lay one hand man hang choose open mouth 
strike sir knight might enter mind would advisable free one stands towards relation certainly knight replied happen able make interest serve matter trouble 
knew better bring money swamp might attacked half dozen ruffians like took precaution informing peter captain men arms spot going bidding case came back set hue cry foot hunt might found especial description worthy self 
walter could hear taken shoes followed distance voices still acted guide swamp 
feared keep close although darkness would conceal figure might moment tread pool ditch betray presence 
putting foot time ground greatest caution moved quietly 
spoke little heavy footsteps swampy ground sufficient guidance 
last ceased suddenly 
words spoken heard returning steps 
drew aside feet crouched saw dim figure pass mist resumed way 
ground firmer replacing shoes walked briskly 
neared higher ground along road ran heard two horsemen galloping away distance

tangled skein geoffrey said must follow carefully 
first piece chalk draw upon wall pedigree royal line france phillip downwards see king edward phillip valois came rival claimants throne france 
see king edward nephew charles le bel last king france phillip valois nephew phillip le bel father charles 
edward consequently direct line isabella man instead woman right throne would unquestionable 
france however law called salic law excludes females throne maintained many learned law although female held incompetent reign sex lead armies battle yet ways forfeits otherwise rights son therefore heir throne 
contention held english jurists many france also well founded edward rightful king france 
phillip valois contends salic law bars female ascending throne also destroys rights succession goes sons next heir male case course phillip rightful king 
say view right one certainly great majority consulted decided according ancient law usage right lies edward 
matters right always might 
isabella married french noble instead english king probable son claim throne would allowed without dispute son king england french nobles prefer ruled one becoming united england one king 
time death last king edward still boy tuition mother phillip man upon spot therefore able win support presence promises came peers france declared phillip valois rightful monarch 
england parliament held northampton rights edward discussed asserted bishops worcester coventry despatched paris protest validity phillip nomination 
however country position enforce claim young king arms phillip became firmly seated king france shown great energy marching repressing people flanders state rebellion count one feudatories french crown nobles well satisfied choice question right ever henceforth raised france 
soon rebellion flanders crushed phillip summoned king england homage aquitaine ponthieu montreuil fiefs held absolutely crown france 
proceeding placed edward council great embarrassment 
case refusal whole possessions crown france might declared forfeited seized england condition defend hand fact homage phillip valois would sort recognition right throne assumed 
edward held reins power hands little doubt would refused would called whole strength england enforce claim 
influence isabella mortimer however powerful agreed edward homage public act making private reservation secret councillors taking exception right phillip 
edward crossed france journeyed amiens phillip brilliant court awaited appointed day appeared together cathedral 
edward certain protestations homage french estates leaving certain terms questions open consideration council

events war tell night 
time us betake us beds 
chapter v city games next evening armourer walter request continued narrative 
soon tournament began fight scotland 
years peace country regency marriage made david king scotland son robert bruce princess joan sister king four years truce agreed 
always fighting scotland walter asked 
tell walter 
peaceful enough days edward set claim throne scotland rights neither anyone else far know ever able make 
fact strong thought could conquer scotland 
quarrels nobles allied blood held possessions kingdoms gave edward excuse interfere 
scotland conquered easily enough hard task hold 
sir william wallace kept country turmoil many years joined common people 
inflicted one heavy defeat upon us stirling receiving support nobles defeated falkirk years afterwards captured executed 
head may see day london bridge 
fought country ever refused allegiance king seems fate cruel one 
appeared quiet robert bruce raised scotland crowned king 
war many years last bannockburn inflicted defeat upon us never 
skirmishes excursions edward ii weak prince seemed marriage david princess joan would bring permanent peace two countries 
many english nobles held claims marriage grants upon lands scotland 
course driven english turned bruce 
terms marriage treaty agreed reinstated 
foolish clause plain king scotland could take lands scotch nobles possession many well nigh powerful 
time edward baliol son great rival robert bruce england 
still claimed throne scotland right 
round gathered number english nobles claimed lands scotland 
king offered hindrance gathering force doubt glad see dissension scotland might give pretext interference edward seized possess country 
first baliol successful crowned scone presently defeated driven scotland 
scots made eruption across frontier retaliation edward permitted baliol gather force war bruce 
king edward point starting ireland hastened north 
defeated scots halidon hill captured berwick placed baliol upon throne 
bruce fled france supported encouraged french king 
ill feeling edward phillip valois gone increasing ever since former compelled take oath allegiance latter outwardly guise friendship kept negotiations went two courts marriage little prince wales joanna daughter french king 
aid phillip gave bruce increased bad feeling edward retaliated phillip patronage bruce receiving greatest honor courtesy robert artois great feudatory france banished king phillip 
time although countries preparing war peace broken edward hands full scotland baliol bestowed immense possessions upon english nobles assisted country rose favor bruce 
three years followed king edward obliged several times go scotland support baliol held crown feudal vassal 
always successful field directly army recrossed frontier scotch rose 
new crusade preached october year king phillip solemnly received cross collected immense army nominally recovery jerusalem 
whether intentions honest say certainly king edward considered phillip real aim creating great army attack england 
whether would need wiser head mine walter tell 
certainly phillip valois invited edward cooperate crusade 
king reply stated belief preparations intended war europe rather asia king france would agree conclude firm league amity two countries restore castles towns aquitaine whose surrender frequently promised never carried would bind oath give assistance direct indirect scotland would join war delivery holy land 
must say king edward demands reasonable clear could march away england whole force leave baliol unsupported assaults scotch enemies aided france 
phillip willing accede first two conditions regard third positively declined treating david bruce restored throne father 
french king openly supported bruce first none could said conduct befriending dethroned monarch aught noble generous along answered edward complaints aid afforded frenchmen bruce denials supported declaration favor certainly seemed show last determined openly throw veil great army really collected england 
robert artois craftily seized moment king indignation phillip highest 
great banquet held king edward warlike nobles present robert entered preceded two noble maidens carrying heron know walter considered cowardly birds 
loud tones called upon knights present swear bird perform deed chivalrous daring 
first presented king edward giving understand regarded little braver heron resigning without blow fair heritage france 
moment well chosen edward smarting answer received phillip 
rose took oath enter france arms wait month order give phillip time offer battle accept combat even french outnumber ten one 
every knight present followed example king war france years mere question time last suddenly decided upon 
walter remember preparations made throughout england men enrolled arms prepared 
armourers busy night day every man felt honor well country concerned winning king edward heritage unlawfully robbed king france 
th march parliament westminster king created little prince seven years age duke cornwall prince immediately exercise new dignity bestowed upon twenty distinguished aspirants honor knighthood 
immense supplies voted parliaments held nottingham westminster northamton 
half wool shorn summer following granted king variety taxes customs duties 
revenues foreign priories england hundred ten number appropriated crown 
provisions bacon wheat oats granted king pawned jewels even crown hire soldiers purchase allies continent 
great scarcity money become country goods fell less half value 
thus vast army raised king edward prepared try strength france 
phillip part making great preparations 
edward purchased assistance many german nobles phillip raised large armaments maritime states italy 
spain also contributed number naval adventurers squadrons fitted vassals sea coasts normandy brittany picardy 
king edward crossed belgium vast delays consequence slowness german allies last prepared enter france end september 
lad story far know beginning war france raging whose events know well seeing late occurrence 
far although english best sorely mauled french north south gained advantages would lead belief likelihood early termination king edward succeed long time winning back inheritance throne france 
doubt war weighs heavily upon people large 
taxes doubled drain men heavy 
armourers course busy time trades furnishing army flourish exceedingly 
moreover men mettle valor opportunity showing composed england rings tales martial deeds 
walter think peace greatest blessings ways lad doubt right many compensations war 
brings noble qualities raises men think valor fortitude endurance honor qualities something mere huckstering desire getting money ignoble ease comfort 
day may world change war may become thing past mind boy doubt whether men happier better 
priests doubt would tell otherwise see armourer perhaps hardly fair judge matter seeing without wars craft would come end 
walter remained thought time 
seems master geoffrey wars may suit strong courageous men women would rejoice things end 
women suffer wars doubt geoffrey said yet mark stirred deeds valor chivalry men ever ready bestow love upon honor glory war even although next battle may leave widows 
always somewhat marvel suppose human nature admiration deeds valor bravery ingrained heart man continue times come desire wealth ever increase seized men look distaste upon everything interfere making money regard man amasses gold trading higher type valiant deeds battle

conversation upon fate much depended going walter ralph discussing situation arrived tolerably correct conclusion 
conduct part brutal french knight ralph strange methinks mere outcome passions hate englishman deeper motive right thinking bargaining person count evreux ransom sought 
object would never thrown us noisome dungeon report treatment would bring dishonor upon eyes every knight noble france well england 
must life aims although grudge passes imagine 
may cressy elsewhere dear relative may fallen sword yet men nourish grudge death killed fair fight 
boots present 
enough us life aims fear ralph must included mine since would never let witness escape carry foul tale 
agreement surrendered broken free make escape methinks sooner attempted better 
let us work plan may best get place 
escape well vannes need despair breaking dungeon holbeaut 
might overpower guard brings food ralph said 
chance walter rejoined think poor one 
may sure dishonourable treatment rendered us desperate take every precaution come well armed 
may come intend us die starvation perchance drowned floods easy see often make way 
escape escape must made loophole 
bar removed methinks wide enough us squeeze 
doubtless hazard occurred seeing nigh twelve feet floor single man could possibility reach two us difficulty 
ralph stand wall 
climb upon shoulders standing reach bar haul look 
soon done walter seizing bar hauled could see loophole 
thought said 
waters somme foot level window river yellow swollen hours heavy rain would bring level sill 
stand steady ralph coming 
reached ground said take belt ralph buckle mine together passing round bar make loop upon stand window see best loosen bar 
constantly wet likely mortar softened case shall little difficulty working 
plan put execution belts fastened together walter standing ralph shoulders passed one end around bar buckled thus making loop three feet length putting foot able stand easily loophole 
put mortar top ralph mortar rotted wet bottom lead poured bar set must scooped moved 
fortunately knight gave orders men remove daggers thrust speedily dig lead must come first strap prevents working foot bar 
must tear strip clothing make shift fasten strap half way bar slip weight 
order accomplish walter stand upon ralph head gain additional height 
presently several attempts succeeded fixing strap firmly bar half way placing one knee loop putting arm bar steady set work lead 
sharp point dagger quickly cut near surface farther hole narrowed task much difficult 
several times ralph relieved work last accomplished bar found move slightly shook

walter said find whether bar first put one hole must good deal deeper iron either shoved pushed end could get hole 
think likely hole held bar top lead poured would fill space first try lift 
must stand head enable high enough try 
head strong enough warrant ralph replied fold jerkin put truth hurt somewhat tying strap bar 
walter efforts succeed raising bar slightest therefore concluded inserted lifted space filled lead 
best said cut away stone either work much better 
put knee strap set work 
stone seems greatly softened wet yield daggers readily enough 
already getting dark soon finished start 
walter discovered stone rotten action weather although got deeper became much harder yielded constant chipping daggers two hours ralph moment happened engaged announced walter dagger found way bottom bar

unbuckle strap move bar otherwise might fall difficulty handing 
steady wall 
ralph seized bar great effort pushed bottom

however done laying quietly pulled thrust loophole 
desperate struggle get wide enough head pass squarely built body difficulty followed
