framley church distant quarter mile stood immediately opposite chief entrance framley court 
mean ugly building erected hundred years since churches built made mean ugly large enough congregation thus driven dissenting chapels sions ebenezers got established side parish putting lady lufton thought pet parson hardly energetic might 
therefore matter near lady lufton heart see new church built urgent eloquence son vicar good work commenced 
beyond church close boys school girls school two distinct buildings owed erection lady lufton energy came neat little grocer shop neat grocer clerk sexton neat grocer wife pew opener church 
podgens name great favorites ladyship servants house

account mercy extended rev e jones spite red face awkward big feet invited dine framley court plain daughter every three months 
hardly house parish framley outside bounds framley court except farmers farm labourers yet parish large extent 
framley eastern division county barsetshire world knows politically speaking true blue county england 
backslidings even true county backslidings pinchbeck days hope find old agricultural virtue purity among backsliders regret say men reckon lord lufton 
violent whig perhaps whig 
jeers sneers old county doings declares solicited subject far concerned mr bright may sit county pleases alleges unfortunately peer right even interest question 
deeply regretted old days portion county decidedly true blue framley district indeed present day dowager able give occasional helping hand 
chaldicotes seat nathaniel sowerby esq moment supposed present one members western division barsetshire 
western division boast none fine political attributes grace twin brother 
decidedly whig almost governed politics one two great whig families 
said mark robarts pay visit chaldicotes hinted wife would well pleased case 
certainly fact dear prudent excellent wife knew mr sowerby eligible friend world young clergyman knew also one house whole county name distasteful lady lufton 
reasons may say manifold 
first place mr sowerby whig seated parliament mainly interest great whig autocrat duke omnium whose residence dangerous even mr sowerby lady lufton regarded impersonation lucifer upon earth 
mr sowerby unmarried indeed also lord lufton much mother grief 
mr sowerby true fifty whereas young lord yet twenty six nevertheless ladyship becoming anxious subject 
mind every man bound marry soon could maintain wife held idea quite private tenet imperfectly conscious men general inclined neglect duty selfish gratifications wicked ones encouraged innocent neglect many would marry unseen coercion exercised sex 
duke omnium head sinners lady lufton greatly feared son might made subject baneful omnium influence means mr sowerby chaldicotes 
mr sowerby known poor man large estate 
wasted men said much electioneering gambling 
considerable portion property already gone hands duke rule bought everything around purchased 
indeed said enemies covetous barsetshire property would lead young neighbor ruin order might get land 
oh come possessed way fair acres framley court become possessed hardly wondered lady lufton like chaldicotes 
chaldicotes set lady lufton called every way opposed set according ideas 
liked cheerful quiet well people loved church country queen anxious make noise world 
desired farmers round able pay rents without trouble old women warm flannel petticoats working men saved rheumatism healthy food dry houses obedient pastors masters temporal well spiritual 
idea loving country 
desired also copses full pheasants stubble field partridges gorse covers foxes way also loved country 
ardently longed crimean war russians might beaten french exclusion english seemed much case hardly english dictatorship lord palmerston 
indeed little faith war lord aberdeen expelled 
indeed lord derby could come chaldicotes set 
nothing dangerous london country mr sowerby indulged indulge bachelor mal practices 
speaking set chief offender mr harold smith perhaps wife 
also member parliament many thought rising man 
father many years debater house held high office 
harold early life intended cabinet working hard trade could ensure success ought obtain sooner later 
already filled one subordinate station treasury month two admiralty astonishing official mankind diligence 
last named months lord aberdeen forced retire 
younger son possessed large fortune 
politics profession therefore importance 
early life married sister mr sowerby lady six seven years older brought scanty dowry people thought matter mr harold smith perspicacious 
mr harold smith personally popular man party though judged eminently useful 
laborious well informed whole honest conceited long winded pompous 
mrs harold smith opposite lord 
clever bright woman good looking time life forty keen sense value worldly things keen relish world pleasures 
neither laborious well informed perhaps altogether honest woman ever understood necessity recognized advantage political honesty neither dull pompous conceited show 
disappointed woman regards husband seeing married speculation would become politically important yet mr smith quite fulfilled prophecies early life 
lady lufton spoke chaldicotes set distinctly included mind bishop barchester wife daughter 
seeing bishop proudie course man much addicted religion religious thinking mr sowerby peculiar religious sentiments whatever would first sight appear ground much intercourse perhaps much intercourse mrs proudie mrs harold smith firm friends four five years standing ever since proudies came diocese therefore bishop usually taken chaldicotes whenever mrs smith paid brother visit 
bishop proudie means high church dignitary lady lufton never forgiven coming diocese 
instinctively high respect episcopal office bishop proudie hardly thought better mr sowerby fabricator evil duke omnium 
whenever mr robarts would plead going anywhere would benefit meeting bishop lady lufton would slightly curl upper lip 
could say words bishop proudie bishop certainly must called better ought curl lip explain knew inner feeling heart 
understood mark robarts least heard information soon reached framley court mr supplehouse make one chaldicotes party 
mr supplehouse worse companion gentleman like young high church conservative county parson even harold smith 
also parliament extolled early days russian war portion metropolitan daily press man could save country 
let ministry jupiter said would hope reform chance england ancient glory would allowed perilous times go headlong oblivion 
upon ministry anticipating much salvation mr supplehouse willing usually jupiter back send gentleman gave footing among 
man born save nation lead people content fill chair secretary supplehouse content soon gave understood place much higher yet tendered 
seals high office war knife alternative offered much belaboured head affairs nothing doubting head affairs would recognize claimant value would eyes wholesome fear jupiter 
head affairs much belaboured knew might pay high even mr supplehouse jupiter savior nation told might swing tomahawk 
since time swinging tomahawk much effect anticipated 
also intimate mr sowerby decidedly one chaldicotes set 
many others included stigma whose sins political religious rather moral 
gall wormwood lady lufton regarded children lost one grieved mother grief knew son among felt patron anger heard clerical prot g seek society

chapter iii chaldicotes chaldicotes house much pretension framley court 
indeed one looks ancient marks rather present day place considerable pretension 
old forest altogether belonging property attached called chace chaldicotes 
portion forest comes close behind mansion gives character celebrity place 
chace chaldicotes greater part least world knows crown property utilitarian days disforested 
former times great forest stretching half across country almost far silverbridge bits still seen intervals throughout whole distance larger remaining portion consisting aged hollow oaks centuries old wide spreading withered beeches stands two parishes chaldicotes uffley 
people still come afar see oaks chaldicotes hear feet rustle among thick autumn leaves 
soon come longer 
giants past ages give way wheat turnips ruthless chancellor exchequer disregarding old associations rural beauty requires money returns lands chace chaldicotes vanish earth surface 
part however private property mr sowerby hitherto pecuniary distresses managed save axe auction mart portion paternal heritage 
house chaldicotes large stone building probably time charles second 
approached fronts heavy double flight stone steps 
front house long solemn straight avenue double row lime trees leads away lodge gates stand center village chaldicotes rear windows open upon four different vistas run forest four open green rides converge together large iron gateway barrier divides private grounds chace 
sowerbys many generations rangers chace chaldicotes thus almost wide authority crown forest

neither told often mr sowerby lord lufton together london 
trouble women matters annoy excellent woman lady lufton mr sowerby one whose intimacy young men would wish reject 
fifty lived perhaps salutary life dressed young usually looked well 
bald good forehead sparkling moist eyes 
clever man pleasant companion always good humored suited 
gentleman high breeding good birth whose ancestors known county longer farmers around would boast land owner unless thornes ullathorne perhaps greshams greshamsbury much longer de courcys courcy castle 
duke omnium comparatively speaking new man 
member parliament friend men power others might man could talk world one knowing matter talked 
moreover whatever might ways life times presence clergyman rarely made offensive clerical tastes 
neither swore brought vices carpet sneered faith church 
churchman least knew live 
possible one vicar relish intimacy mr sowerby might well would say woman like lady lufton turn nose lady lufton spent ten months year framley court ten months matter two months also spent london saw one set 
women understand things vicar said even wife good nice sensible intelligent even understand man world must meet sorts men days clergyman hermit
