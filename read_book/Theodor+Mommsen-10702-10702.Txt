third distinction one still general nature distinction wealthy poor especially dispossessed endangered possession 
legal political relations rome led rise numerous class farmers partly small proprietors dependent mercy capitalist partly small temporary lessees dependent mercy landlord many instances deprived individuals well whole communities lands held without affecting personal freedom

abolition life presidency community servian reform placed metoikos footing equality military point view burgess appears originated considerations administrative nature rather political party tendency may assume first movements led internal crises changes constitution sought limit magistracy 
earliest achievement ancient opposition rome consisted abolition life tenure presidency community words abolition monarchy 
necessarily result natural development things strikingly demonstrated fact change constitution took place analogous manner whole circuit italo grecian world 
rome likewise among latins well among sabellians etruscans apulians generally italian communities greece find rulers life earlier epoch superseded times annual magistrates 
case lucanian canton evidence democratic government time peace event war magistrates appointed king official similar roman dictator 
sabellian civic communities capua pompeii like manner later times governed community manager medix tuticus changed year year may assume similar institutions existed among national civic communities italy 
light reasons led substitution consuls kings rome need explanation 
organism ancient greek italian polity developed sort natural necessity limitation life presidency shortened part annual term 
simple however cause change might brought various ways resolution might adopted death one life ruler elect another course roman senate said attempted death romulus ruler might voluntarily abdicate alleged intention king servius tullius people might rise rebellion tyrannical ruler expel 
expulsion tarquins rome latter way monarchy terminated rome 
however much history expulsion last tarquinius proud may interwoven anecdotes spun romance leading outlines called question 
tradition credibly enough indicates causes revolt king neglected consult senate complete numbers pronounced sentences capital punishment confiscation without advising counsellors accumulated immense stores grain granaries exacted burgesses military labor task work beyond due 
exasperation people attested formal vow made man man posterity thenceforth would never tolerate king blind hatred name king ever afterwards regarded rome enactment king offering sacrifice rex sacrorum sacrificulus considered duty create gods might miss accustomed mediator disqualified holding office man became foremost indeed also powerless roman commonwealth 
along last king members clan banished proof close time gentile ties still 
tarquinii thereupon transferred caere perhaps ancient home family tomb recently discovered 
room one president holding office life two annual rulers placed head roman community 
looked upon historically certain reference important event 
conceivable great community extensive dominion like roman royal power particularly family several generations would capable resistance struggle would thus keener smaller states certain indication interference foreign states struggle 
great war etruria possibly moreover placed close upon expulsion tarquins consequence chronological confusion roman annals regarded intervention etruria favor countryman injured rome sufficient reason etruscans notwithstanding complete victory neither restored roman monarchy even brought back tarquinian family 
powers consuls left ignorance historical connections important event fortunately possession clearer light nature change made constitution 
royal power means abolished shown fact vacancy occurred afterwards interim king interrex nominated 
one life king simply replaced two year kings called generals praetores judges iudices merely colleagues consules 
principles collegiate tenure annual duration distinguish republic monarchy first meet us 
collegiate arrangement collegiate principle third subsequently current name annual kings derived assumed case altogether peculiar form 
supreme power entrusted two magistrates conjointly consul possessed exercised fully wholly possessed exercised king 
carried far instead one two colleagues undertaking perhaps administration justice command army administered justice simultaneously city set together army case collision matter decided rotation measured months days 
certain partition functions withal least supreme military command might doubtless take place outset one consul example taking field aequi volsci wise binding force colleagues legally liberty interfere time province 
therefore supreme power confronted supreme power one colleague forbade enjoined consular commands neutralized 
peculiarly latin peculiarly roman institution co ordinate supreme authorities roman commonwealth whole approved practicable difficult find parallel considerable state manifestly sprang endeavor retain regal power legally undiminished fulness 
thus led break royal office parts transfer individual college simply double thereby necessary neutralize action 
term office regards termination tenure office earlier interregnum five days furnished legal precedent 
ordinary presidents community bound remain office longer year reckoned day entering functions ceased de jure magistrates upon expiry year interrex expiry five days 
set termination supreme office practical irresponsibility king lost case consul 
true king always roman commonwealth subject superior law according roman view supreme judge could prosecuted bar king might doubtless committed crime tribunal punishment 
consul committed murder treason protected office long lasted retirement liable ordinary penal jurisdiction like burgess 
leading changes affecting principles constitution restrictions added subordinate external character nevertheless produced deep effect privilege king fields tilled task work burgesses special relation clientship metoeci body must stood king ceased life tenure office 
right appeal hitherto criminal processes well fines corporal punishments province king investigate decide cause also decide whether person found guilty allowed appeal pardon 
valerian law enacted consul must allow appeal condemned sentence capital corporal punishment pronounced otherwise martial law regulation later law uncertain date passed extended heavy fines 
token right appeal consul appeared capacity judge general consular lictors laid aside axes previously carried virtue penal jurisdiction belonging master 
law however threatened magistrate allow due course provocatio penalty infamy matters stood essentially nothing moral stain utmost effect disqualifying infamous person giving testimony 
course followed based view law impossible diminish old regal powers checks imposed upon holder supreme authority consequence revolution strictly viewed practical moral value 
therefore consul acted within old regal jurisdiction might acting perpetrate injustice committed crime consequently amenable penal judge 
limitation similar tendency took place civil jurisdiction probably taken consuls outset right deciding discretion legal dispute private persons 
restrictions delegation powers remodelling criminal civil procedure stood connection general arrangement respecting transference magisterial power deputies successors 
king absolutely liberty nominate deputies never compelled consuls exercised right delegating power essentially different way 
doubt rule supreme magistrate left city appoint warden administration justice remained force also consuls collegiate arrangement even extended delegation contrary appointment laid consul last leave city 
right delegation time consuls remained city probably restricted upon introduction office providing delegation prescribed consul definite cases prohibited cases prescribed 
according principle said whole judicial system organized 
consul could certainly exercise criminal jurisdiction also capital process way submitting sentence community thereupon confirmed rejected never far see exercised right perhaps soon allowed exercise possibly pronounced criminal judgment case appeal community reason excluded 
direct conflict supreme magistrate community community avoided criminal procedure organized really way supreme magistracy remained theory competent always acted deputies necessary though appointed 
two standing pronouncers judgment revolt high treason duoviri perduellionis two standing trackers murder quaestores parricidii 
something similar may perhaps occurred regal period king represented processes standing character latter institution collegiate principle carried belong rate republic 
latter arrangement became great importance also far thereby first time alongside two standing supreme magistrates placed two assistants supreme magistrate nominated entrance office due course also went leaving whose position thus like supreme magistracy organized according principles standing office collegiate form annual tenure 
indeed yet inferior magistracy least sense republic associated magisterial position inasmuch commissioners emanate choice community doubtless became starting point institution subordinate magistrates afterwards developed manifold ways 
similar way decision civil procedure withdrawn supreme magistracy inasmuch right king transfer individual process decision deputy converted duty consul settling legitimate title party object suit refer disposal private man selected furnished instructions 
like manner left consuls important administration state treasure state archives nevertheless probably least early associated standing assistants duty namely quaestors doubtless exercising function absolutely obey without whose previous knowledge co operation consuls could act 
hand directions existence president community capital personally intervene indeed example introductory steps process could circumstances let represented deputy 
double restriction consular right delegation subsisted government city primarily administration justice state chest 
commander chief hand consul retained right handing duties devolving 
diversity treatment civil military delegation explains government roman community proper delegated magisterial authority pro magistrate possible purely urban magistrates ever represented non magistrates hand military deputies pro consuls pro praetore pro quaestore excluded action within community proper 
nominating successor right nominating successor possessed king interrex 
consul respect placed like footing latter nevertheless event exercised power interrex stepped necessary continuity office subsisted still undiminished republican government 
right nomination however materially restricted favor burgesses consul bound procure assent burgesses successors designated sequel nominate community designated 
binding right proposal nomination ordinary supreme magistrates doubtless certain sense passed substantially hands community practically however still existed considerable distinction right proposal right formal nomination 
consul conducting election means mere returning officer could still e g virtue old royal prerogative reject particular candidates disregard votes tendered first might even limit choice list candidates proposed still consequence collegiate consulship supplemented dictator shall speak immediately supplementing community consulted contrary consul case appointed colleague freedom wherewith interrex appointed king 
change nomination priests nomination priests prerogative kings transferred consuls colleges priests filled vacancies ranks vestals single priests nominated pontifical college devolved also exercise paternal jurisdiction speak community priestesses vesta 
view performance acts could properly performed single individual college probably period first nominated president pontifex maximus 
separation supreme authority things sacred civil power already mentioned king sacrifice neither civil sacred powers king simply title conferred upon semi magisterial position new high priest decidedly contrasting character otherwise marked priesthood rome form one significant important peculiarities state revolution aim impose limits powers magistrates mainly interest aristocracy 
already mentioned outward state consul far inferior regal office hedged round reverence terror regal name priestly consecration withheld axe taken away attendants 
add instead purple robe king worn consul distinguished ordinary burgess simply purple border toga king perhaps regularly appeared public chariot consul bound accommodate general rule like every burgess go within city foot 
dictator limitations however plenary power insignia magistracy applied main ordinary presidency community 
extraordinary cases alongside certain sense instead two presidents chosen community emerged single one master army magister populi usually designated dictator 
choice dictator community exercised influence proceeded solely free resolve one consuls time whose action neither colleague authority could hinder 
appeal sentence king unless chose allow 
soon nominated magistrates right subject authority 
hand duration dictator office limited two ways first official colleague consuls one nominated might remain office beyond legal term secondly period six months fixed absolute maximum duration office 
arrangement peculiar dictatorship master army bound nominate immediately master horse magister equitum acted along dependent assistant somewhat quaestor along consul retired office arrangement undoubtedly connected fact dictator presumably leader infantry constitutionally prohibited mounting horseback 
light regulations dictatorship doubtless conceived institution arose time consulship designed especially event war obviate time disadvantages divided power revive temporarily regal authority war particularly equality rights consuls could appear fraught danger positive testimonies oldest names given magistrate assistant well limitation office duration summer campaign exclusion provocatio attest pre eminently military design original dictatorship 
whole therefore consuls continued kings supreme administrators judges generals even religious point view rex sacrorum nominated name might preserved consul offered prayers sacrifices community name ascertained gods aid skilled sacred lore 
cases emergency moreover power retained reviving moment without previous consultation community full unlimited regal authority set aside limitations imposed collegiate arrangement special curtailments jurisdiction 
way problem legally retaining practically restricting regal authority solved genuine roman fashion equal acuteness simplicity nameless statesmen worked revolution 
centuries curies community thus acquired change constitution rights greatest importance right annually designating presidents deciding last instance regarding life death burgess 
body acquired rights could possibly community hitherto constituted patriciate practically become order nobility 
strength nation lay multitude plebs already comprehended large numbers people note wealth 
exclusion multitude public assembly although bore part public burdens might tolerated long public assembly material share working state machine long royal power fact high free position remained almost equally formidable burgesses metoeci thereby maintained equality legal redress nation 
community called regularly elect decide president practically reduced master commissioner set term relation could longer maintained stood least state remodelled morrow revolution could carried co operation patricians metoeci 
extension community inevitable accomplished comprehensive manner inasmuch collective plebeiate non burgesses neither slaves citizens extraneous communities living rome ius hospitii admitted burgess body 
curiate assembly old burgesses hitherto legally practically first authority state almost totally deprived constitutional prerogatives 
retain previous powers acts purely formal affected clan relations vow allegiance taken consul dictator entered office previously king legal dispensations requisite arrogatio testament future perform act properly political character 
soon even plebeians admitted right voting also curies step old burgess body lost right meeting resolving 
curial organization virtually rooted far based clan organization latter found purity exclusively among old burgesses 
plebeians admitted curies certainly also allowed constitute de jure earlier period could de facto families clans distinctly recorded tradition also conceivable portion plebeians proceeded far constitute gentes thus new curiate assembly opposition original character included numerous members belonged clan 
political prerogatives public assembly well decision appeals criminal causes indeed essentially political processes nomination magistrates adoption rejection laws transferred acquired assembled levy bound military service centuries received rights previously borne burdens citizens 
way small initial movements made servian constitution particular handing army right assenting declaration aggressive war attained development curies completely ever cast shade assembly centuries people became accustomed regard latter sovereign people 
assembly debate took place merely presiding magistrate chose speak bade others course cases appeal parties heard 
simple majority centuries decisive 
curiate assembly entitled vote footing entire equality therefore admission plebeians curies result would complete democracy may easily conceived decision political questions continued withheld curies centuriate assembly placed preponderating influence hands nobles certainly possessors property important privilege priority voting often practically decided election placed hands equites words rich 
senate senate affected reform constitution way community 
previously existing college elders continued exclusively patrician retained also essential prerogatives right appointing interrex confirming rejecting resolutions adopted community constitutional unconstitutional 
fact prerogatives enhanced reform constitution appointment magistrates also fell made election community thenceforth subject confirmation rejection patrician senate 
cases appeal alone confirmation far know never deemed requisite matter stake pardon guilty granted sovereign assembly people canceling act wholly question 
although abolition monarchy constitutional rights patrician senate increased rather diminished yet took place according tradition immediately abolition monarchy far regards affairs fell discussed senate admitted freer treatment enlargement body brought plebeians also consequences led complete remodelling whole 
earliest times senate acted also although solely especially state council probably even time kings regarded unconstitutional non senators case take part assembly arranged discussions associated patrician senate patres number non patricians added roll conscripti 
put footing equality plebeians senate become senators remained members equestrian order designated patres even conscripti right badge senatorial dignity red shoe 
moreover remained absolutely excluded exercise magisterial prerogatives belonging senate auctoritas obliged even question reference merely advice consilium rest content privilege present silence question put patricians turn indicating opinion adding numbers division taken voting feet pedibus sententiam ire pedarii proud nobility expressed 
nevertheless plebeians found way new constitution merely forum also senate house first difficult step towards equality rights taken quarter also 
otherwise material change arrangements affecting senate 
among patrician members distinction rank soon came recognized especially putting vote proximately designated supreme magistracy already administered entered list called upon vote rest position first foreman senate princeps senatus soon became highly coveted place honor 
consul office hand ranked member senate king therefore taking votes include 
selection members narrower patrician senate merely added roll fell made consuls formerly kings nature case implied king still perhaps measure regard representation several clans senate consideration account far concerned plebeians among clan organization imperfectly developed consequently relation senate organization general fell abeyance 
information electing consuls restricted admitting definite number plebeians senate need regulation consuls belonged nobility 
hand probably outset consul virtue position practically far less free far bound opinions order custom appointment senators king 
rule particular holding consulship necessarily followed admission senate life probably case time consul yet member time election must probability early acquired consuetudinary force 
like manner seems become early custom fill senators places immediately falling vacant revise complete roll senate occasion census consequently rule every fourth year also involved unimportant restriction authority entrusted selection 
whole number senators remained conscripti also included fact probably entitled infer numerical falling patriciate 
conservative character revolution thus see roman commonwealth even conversion monarchy republic old far possible retained 
far revolution state conservative one one constituent elements commonwealth really overthrown 
circumstance indicates character whole movement 
expulsion tarquins pitiful deeply falsified accounts represent work people carried away sympathy enthusiasm liberty work two great political parties already engaged conflict clearly aware conflict would steadily continue old burgesses metoeci like english whigs tories moment united common danger threatened convert commonwealth arbitrary government despot differed soon danger 
old burgesses could get rid monarchy without cooperation new burgesses new burgesses far sufficiently strong wrest power hands former one blow 
compromises sort necessarily limited smallest measure mutual concessions obtained tedious bargaining leave future decide constituent elements shall eventually preponderate whether work harmoniously together counteract one another 
look therefore merely direct innovations possibly mere change duration supreme magistracy altogether mistake broad import first roman revolution indirect effects far important vaster doubtless even authors anticipated 
new community short time roman burgess body later sense term originated 
plebeians hitherto metoeci subjected share taxes burdens nevertheless eye law really nothing tolerated aliens whose position foreigners proper may seemed hardly necessary draw definite line distinction 
enrolled lists burgesses liable military service although still far footing legal equality although old burgesses still remained exclusively entitled perform acts authority constitutionally pertaining council elders exclusively eligible civil magistracies priesthoods nay even preference entitled participate usufructs burgesses joint use public pasture yet first difficult step towards complete equalization gained time plebeians longer served merely common levy also voted common assembly common council opinion asked head back poorest metoikos well protected right appeal noblest old burgesses 
one consequence amalgamation patricians plebeians new corporation roman burgesses conversion old burgesses clan nobility incapable receiving additions even filling ranks since nobles longer possessed right passing decrees common assembly adoption new families nobility decree community appeared still less admissible 
kings ranks roman nobility thus closed admission new clans rare occurrence genuine characteristic patricianism made appearance sure herald speedy loss political privileges exclusive estimation community 
exclusion plebeians public magistracies public priesthoods admissible position officers senators maintenance perverse obstinacy legal impossibility marriage old burgesses plebeians impressed patriciate outset stamp exclusive wrongly privileged aristocracy 
second consequence new union burgesses must definite regulation right settlement reference latin confederates states 
became necessary much account right suffrage centuries indeed belonged freeholder account right appeal intended conceded plebeian foreigner dwelling time even permanently rome express precisely conditions acquisition plebeian rights mark enlarged burgess body turn non burgesses 
thisepoch therefore may trace back views feelings people invidiousness distinction patricians plebeians strict haughty line demarcation cives romani aliens 
former civic distinction nature transient latter political one permanent sense political unity rising greatness thus implanted heart nation expansive enough first undermine carry away mighty current paltry distinctions 
law edict period moreover law edict separated 
distinction indeed foundation essential character roman state even regal power rome subordinate superior law land 
profound practical veneration romans like every people political capacity cherished principle authority gave birth remarkable rule roman constitutional private law every command magistrate based upon law least valid tenure office although expired tenure 
evident view long presidents nominated life distinction law edict must practically almost lost sight legislative activity public assembly could acquire development 
hand obtained wide field action presidents changed annually fact means void practical importance consul deciding process committed legal informality successor could institute fresh trial cause 
civil military authority period finally provinces civil military authority separated 
former law ruled latter axe former governed constitutional checks right appeal regulated delegation latter general held absolute sway like king 
established principle general army ordinary circumstances enter city proper 
organic permanently operative enactments could made authority civil power implied spirit letter constitution 
instances indeed occasionally occurred general disregarding principle convoked forces camp burgess assembly decree passed circumstances legally void custom disapproved proceeding soon fell disuse though forbidden 
distinction quirites soldiers became deeply rooted minds burgesses 
government patriciate time however required development consequences new republicanism vividly posterity felt effects revolution probably appeared contemporary world first different light 
non burgesses indeed gained burgess rights new burgess body acquired comitia centuriata comprehensive prerogatives right rejection part patrician senate firm serried ranks confronted comitia upper house legally hampered freedom movement precisely important matters although position thwart serious collective body could yet practically delay cripple 
nobility giving claim sole embodiment community seem lost much respects decidedly gained 
king true patrician well consul right nominating members senate belonged latter former exceptional position raised former less patricians plebeians cases might easily occur would obliged lean upon support multitude even nobility consul ruling brief term term simply one nobility obeying morrow noble fellow burgess commanded day means occupied position aloof order spirit noble must far powerful magistrate 
indeed time way exception patrician disinclined rule nobility called government official authority paralyzed partly priestly colleges pervaded intense aristocratic spirit partly colleague easily suspended dictatorship still moment wanted first element political power time 
president commonwealth whatever plenary authority may conceded never gain possession political power continue considerable time head affairs necessary condition every dominion duration 
consequently senate appointed life inevitably acquired virtue chiefly title advise magistrate points speak narrower patrician enlarged patricio plebeian senate great influence contrasted annual rulers legal relations became precisely inverted senate substantially assumed powers government former ruler sank president acting chairman executing decrees 
case every proposal submitted community acceptance rejection practice previously consulting whole senate obtaining approval constitutionally necessary consecrated use wont lightly willingly departed 
course followed case important state treaties management distribution public lands generally every act effects extended beyond official year nothing left consul transaction current business initial steps civil processes command war 
especially important consequences change virtue neither consul even otherwise absolute dictator permitted touch public treasure except consent senate 
senate made obligatory consuls commit administration public chest king managed might rate managed two standing subordinate magistrates nominated doubt consuls obey may easily conceived much dependent consuls senate 
thus drew hands management finance right sanctioning expenditure money part roman senate may placed parallel effects right sanctioning taxation constitutional monarchies present day 
consequences followed matter course 
first essential condition aristocratic government plenary power state vested individual corporation 
preponderantly aristocratic corporation senate appropriated government time executive power remained hands nobility also entirely subject governing corporation 
true considerable number men belonging nobility sat senate incapable holding magistracies even taking part debates thus excluded practical share government necessarily played subordinate part senate moreover kept pecuniary dependence corporation economically important privilege using public pasture 
gradually recognized right patrician consuls revise modify senatorial list least every fourth year ineffective presumably nobility might well employed interest obnoxious plebeian might means kept senate even removed ranks 
plebeian opposition therefore quite true immediate effect revolution establish aristocratic government 
however whole truth 
majority contemporaries probably thought revolution brought upon plebeians rigid despotism come afterwards discern revolution germs young liberty 
patricians gained gained expense community magistrate power 
true community gained narrowly restricted rights far less practical palpable acquisitions nobility one thousand probably wisdom value formed pledge earnest future 
hitherto metoeci politically nothing old burgesses everything former embraced community old burgesses overcome however much might still wanting full civil equality first breach occupation last post decides fall fortress 
justice therefore roman community dated political existence beginning consulate 
however republican revolution may notwithstanding aristocratic rule first instance established justly called victory former metoeci plebs revolution even respect bore means character accustomed present day designate democratic 
pure personal merit without support birth wealth could perhaps gain influence consideration easily regal government patriciate 
admission patriciate law foreclosed highest object plebeian ambition admitted dumb appendage senate 
nature case implied governing aristocratic order far admitted plebeians would grant right occupying seats senate absolutely best men chiefly heads wealthy notable plebeian families families thus admitted jealously guarded possession senatorial stalls 
complete legal equality therefore subsisted within old burgess body new burgess body former metoeci came way divided first number privileged families multitude kept position inferiority 
power community according centuriate organization came hands class since servian reform army taxation borne mainly burdens state namely freeholders indeed much hands great proprietors small cottagers intermediate class farmers arrangement seniors still far privileged although less numerous many voting divisions juniors 
way axe laid root old burgess body clan nobility basis new burgess body laid preponderance latter rested possession land age first beginnings already visible new aristocracy based primarily actual consideration families held future nobility 
could clearer indication fundamentally conservative character roman commonwealth fact revolution gave birth republic laid time primary outlines new organization state like manner conservative like manner aristocratic

first time italy united one state sovereignty roman community 
political prerogatives roman community occasion withdrew italian communities took sole keeping words conception state law associated sovereignty rome nowhere expressly informed significant circumstance indicating prudent calculation even exist generally current expression conception 
privileges demonstrably belonged rights making war concluding treaties coining money 
italian community could declare war foreign state even negotiate coin money circulation 
hand every declaration war made roman people every state treaty resolved upon binding law italian communities silver money rome legally current throughout italy 
probable formulated prerogatives leading community extended 
necessarily attached rights sovereignty practically went far beyond 
full roman franchise relations italians sustained leading community exhibited detail great inequalities 
point view addition full burgesses rome three different classes subjects distinguished 
full franchise first place extended far possible without wholly abandoning idea urban commonwealth applied roman commune 
old burgess domain hitherto enlarged chiefly individual assignation way southern etruria far towards caere falerii districts taken hernici sacco anio largest part sabine country large tracts territory formerly volscian especially pomptine plain converted land roman farmers new burgess districts instituted mostly inhabitants 
course even already taken falernian district volturnus ceded capua 
burgesses domiciled outside rome without commonwealth administration assigned territory arose market villages fora et conciliabula 
position greatly different placed burgesses sent called maritime colonies mentioned likewise left possession full burgess rights rome whose self administration little moment 
towards close period roman community appears begun grant full burgess rights adjoining communities passive burgesses like closely kindred nationality probably done first tusculum presumably also communities passive burgesses latium proper end period extended sabine towns doubtless even essentially latinized given sufficient proof fidelity last severe war 
towns retained restricted self administration earlier legal position belonged even admission roman burgess union maritime colonies furnished model special commonwealths subsisting within body roman full burgesses course time roman municipal organization 
accordingly range full roman burgesses must end epoch extended northward far vicinity caere eastward far apennines southward far tarracina although case indeed speak boundary strict sense partly number federal towns latin rights tibur praeneste signia norba circeii found within bounds partly beyond inhabitants minturnae sinuessa falernian territory town sena gallica townships likewise possessed full franchise families roman farmers presumably even found scattered throughout italy either isolated united villages 
subject communities among subject communities passive burgesses cives sine suffragio apart privilege electing elected stood equality rights duties full burgesses 
legal position regulated decrees roman comitia rules issued roman praetor however doubtless based essentially previous arrangements 
justice administered roman praetor deputies praefecti annually sent individual communities 
better position city capua retained self administration along continued use native language officials took charge levy census 
communities inferior rights caere deprived even self administration doubtless oppressive among different forms subjection 
however remarked already apparent close period effort incorporate communities least far de facto latinized among full burgesses 
latins among subject communities privileged important class latin towns obtained accessions equally numerous important autonomous communities founded rome within even beyond italy latin colonies called always increasing consequence new settlements nature 
new urban communities roman origin latin rights became real buttresses roman rule italy 
latins however means battles lake regillus trifanum fought 
old members alban league reckoned originally equal better community rome felt dominion rome oppressive yoke fearfully rigorous measures security taken praeneste beginning war pyrrhus collisions evidently long continued occur praenestines particular show 
old latium essentially either perished become merged rome numbered communities politically self subsisting exception tibur praeneste throughout insignificant 
latium later times republic contrary consisted almost exclusively communities beginning honored rome capital parent city settled amidst regions alien language alien habits attached rome community language law manners petty tyrants surrounding districts obliged doubtless lean rome existence like advanced posts leaning upon main army fine consequence increasing material advantages roman citizenship ever deriving considerable benefit equality rights romans limited though

venusian inscriptions time roman republic beneventane inscriptions recently brought light show venusia well rome plebs tribunes people chief magistrates beneventum bore title consul least time hannibalic war 
communities among recent latin colonies older rights perceive pretensions stirring middle fifth century 
called latins issuing roman burgess body feeling every respect level already began view displeasure subordinate federal rights strive full equalization 
accordingly senate exerted curtail latin communities however important rome far possible rights privileges convert position allies subjects far could done without removing wall partition non latin communities italy 
already described abolition league latin communities well former complete equality rights loss important political privileges belonging 
complete subjugation italy step taken beginning made towards restriction personal rights hitherto touched individual latin especially important right freedom settlement 
case ariminum founded autonomous communities constituted afterwards advantage enjoyed compared subjects restricted equalization burgesses roman community far regarded private rights traffic barter well inheritance 
presumably time full right free migration allowed latin communities hitherto established title every one burgesses gain transmigration rome full burgess rights latin colonies later erection restricted persons attained highest office community native home alone allowed exchange colonial burgess rights roman 
clearly shows complete revolution position rome 
long rome still one among many urban communities italy although one might first admission even unrestricted roman franchise universally regarded gain admitting community acquisition franchise non burgesses facilitated every way fact often imposed punishment 
roman community became sole sovereign others servants state matters changed 
roman community began jealously guard franchise accordingly put end first instance old full liberty migration although statesmen period wise enough still keep admission roman franchise legally open least men eminence capacity highest class subject communities 
latins thus made feel rome subjugated italy mainly aid longer need 
non latin allied communities lastly relations non latin allied communities subject matter course various rules particular treaty alliance defined 
several perpetual alliances hernican communities passed footing complete equalization latin 
others case neapolis nola heraclea granted rights comparatively comprehensive others tarentine samnite treaties may approximated despotism 
dissolution national leagues furnishing contingents general rule may taken granted latin hernican national confederations fact expressly stated confederations subsisting italy samnite lucanian leagues particular legally dissolved rate reduced insignificance general italian community allowed right acquiring property intermarriage even right joint consultation resolution 
provision must made different forms placing military financial resources italian communities disposal leading community 
although burgess militia one hand contingents latin name still regarded main integral constituents roman army way national character whole preserved roman cives sine suffragio called forth join ranks beyond doubt non latin federate communities also either bound furnish ships war case greek cities placed roll contingent furnishing italians formula togatorum must ordained gradually case apulians sabellians etruscans 
general contingent like latin communities appears numbers definitely fixed although case necessity leading community precluded making larger requisition 
time involved indirect taxation every community bound equip pay contingent 
accordingly without design supply costly requisites war devolved chiefly latin non latin federate communities war marine part kept greek cities cavalry service allies least subsequently called upon furnish proportion thrice numerous roman burgesses infantry old principle contingent allies numerous burgess army still remained force long time least rule 
system government division classification subjects system fabric constructed kept together longer ascertained detail notices reached us 
even numerical proportions three classes subjects relatively full burgesses longer determined even approximately like manner geographical distribution several categories italy imperfectly known 
leading ideas structure based hand obvious scarcely necessary specially set forth 
first already said immediate circle ruling community extended partly settlement full burgesses partly conferring passive burgess rights far possible without completely decentralizing roman community urban one intended remain 
system incorporation extended perhaps even beyond natural limits communities subsequently added submit position subjection pure hegemony permanent relation intrinsically impossible 
thus arbitrary monopolizing sovereignty inevitable force circumstances side class ruling burgesses second class subjects took place 
one primary expedients roman rule subdivide governed breaking italian confederacies instituting large number possible comparatively small communities graduate pressure rule according different categories subjects 
cato government household took care slaves good terms one another designedly fomented variances factions among roman community acted great scale 
expedient generous effectual 
aristocratic remodelling constitutions italian communities wider application expedient dependent community constitution remodelled roman pattern government wealthy respectable families installed naturally less keenly opposed multitude induced material interests wish local power lean roman support 
remarkable instance sort furnished treatment capua appears first treated suspicious precaution italian city could come possible rivalry rome 
campanian nobility received privileged jurisdiction separate places assembly every respect distinctive position indeed even obtained inconsiderable pensions sixteen hundred stateres pounds annually charged campanian exchequer 
campanian equites whose refusal take part great latino campanian insurrection mainly contributed failure whose brave swords decided day favor romans sentinum whereas campanian infantry rhegium first body troops war pyrrhus revolted rome 
another remarkable instance roman practice turning account interest variances orders dependent communities favoring aristocracy furnished treatment volsinii met 
rome old new burgesses must stood opposed one another latter must attained legal means equality political rights 
consequence old burgesses volsinii resorted roman senate request restoration old constitution step ruling party city naturally viewed high treason inflicted legal punishment accordingly petitioners 
roman senate however took part old burgesses city showed disposition submit destroyed military violence communal constitution volsinii recognized operation also razing old capital etruria exhibited italians fearfully palpable proof mastery rome 
moderation government roman senate wisdom overlook fact means giving permanence despotism moderation part despots 
account left conferred dependent communities autonomy included shadow independence special share military political successes rome free communal constitution far italian confederacy extended existed community helots 
account also rome first clear sightedness magnanimity perhaps unparalleled history waived dangerous rights government right taxing subjects 
tribute perhaps imposed dependent celtic cantons far italian confederacy extended tributary community 
account lastly duty bearing arms partially devolved subjects ruling burgesses means exempt probable latter proportionally far numerous body allies body probably latins whole liable far greater demands upon non latin allied communities 
thus certain reasonableness appropriation rome ranked first latins next distribution spoil acquired war 
intermediate functionaries valuation empire central administration rome solved difficult problem preserving supervision control mass italian communities liable furnish contingents partly means four italian quaestorships partly extension roman censorship whole dependent communities 
quaestors fleet along immediate duty raise revenues newly acquired domains control contingents new allies first roman functionaries residence district rome assigned law formed necessary intermediate authority roman senate italian communities

various nations inhabiting lands probably first led feel unity partly common contrast greeks partly mainly common resistance celts although italian community may made common cause celts rome employed opportunity recover independence yet long run sound national feeling necessarily prevailed 
gallic field late period stood contrasted law italian men toga thus named contrast celtic men hose braccati probable repelling celtic invasions played important diplomatic part reason pretext centralizing military resources italy hands romans

townships colonized italians lying beyond limits sena gallica ariminum beyond apennines messana sicily reckoned geographically situated italy even like ariminum members confederacy even like sena roman burgess communities 
still less could celtic cantons beyond apennines reckoned among togati although perhaps already among clients rome 
first steps towards latininzing italy new position rome great power new italy thus become political unity also course becoming national unity 
already ruling latin nationality assimilated sabines volscians scattered isolated latin communities italy germs merely developed subsequently latin language became mother tongue every one entitled wear latin toga 
romans already clearly recognized aim shown familiar extension latin name whole body contingent furnishing italian allies

military system manipular legion entrenchment camp cavalry officers military discipline training classes soldiers military value manipular legion complete revolution occurred epoch military system 
primitive graeco italian military organization probably based like homeric selection distinguished effective warriors ordinarily fought horseback form special vanguard later regal period superseded legio old dorian phalanx hoplites probably eight file deep 
phalanx thenceforth undertook chief burden battle cavalry stationed flanks mounted dismounted according circumstances chiefly employed reserve 
arrangement developed nearly time phalanx sarrissae macedonia manipular arrangement italy former formed closing deepening latter breaking multiplying ranks first instance division old legio two legiones men 
old doric phalanx wholly adapted close combat sword especially spear accessory subordinate position order battle assigned missile weapons 
manipular legion thrusting lance confined third division instead first two furnished new peculiar italian missile weapon pilum square round piece wood four half feet long triangular quadrangular iron point originally perhaps invented defense ramparts camp soon transferred rear front ranks hurled advancing line ranks enemy distance ten twenty paces 
time sword acquired far greater importance short knife phalangite could ever volley javelins intended first instance merely prepare way attack sword hand 
moreover phalanx single mighty lance hurled upon enemy new italian legion smaller units existed also phalanx system order battle firmly indissolubly united tactically separated 
merely close square divided said two equally strong halves separated direction depth three divisions hastati principes triarii moderate depth probably amounting ordinary cases four files broken along front ten bands manipuli way every two divisions every two maniples left perceptible interval 
mere continuation process individualizing collective mode fighting discouraged even diminished tactical unit single combat became prominent evident already mentioned decisive part played hand hand encounters combats sword 
system entrenching camp underwent also peculiar development 
place army encamped even single night invariably provided regular circumvallation converted fortress 
little change took place hand cavalry manipular legion retained secondary part occupied side phalanx 
system officering army also continued main unchanged two legions regular army set many war tribunes hitherto commanded whole army number staff officers thus doubled 
period probably clear line demarcation became established subaltern officers common soldiers gain place head maniples sword passed regular promotion lower higher maniples military tribunes placed head whole legions six whose case regular promotion men better class usually taken 
respect must become matter importance previously subaltern well staff officers uniformly nominated general latter posts filled election burgesses 
lastly old fearfully strict military discipline remained unaltered 
still formerly general liberty behead man serving camp scourge rods staff officer well common soldier punishments inflicted merely account common crimes also officer allowed deviate orders received division allowed surprised fled field battle 
hand new military organization necessitated far serious prolonged military training previous phalanx system solidity mass kept even inexperienced ranks 
nevertheless special soldier class sprang contrary army still remained burgess army object chiefly attained abandoning former mode ranking soldiers according property arranging according length service 
roman recruit entered among light armed skirmishers rorarii fought outside line especially stone slings advanced step step first second division till length soldiers long service experience associated together corps triarii numerically weakest imparted tone spirit whole army 
excellence military organization became primary cause superior political position roman community chiefly depended three great military principles maintaining reserve combining close distant modes fighting combining offensive defensive 
system reserve already foreshadowed earlier employment cavalry completely developed partition army three divisions reservation flower veterans last decisive shock 
hellenic phalanx developed close oriental squadrons horse armed bows light missile spears distant modes fighting respectively roman combination heavy javelin sword produced results similar justly remarked attained modern warfare introduction bayonet muskets volley javelins prepared way sword encounter exactly way volley musketry precedes charge bayonet 
lastly elaborate system encampment allowed romans combine advantages defensive offensive war decline give battle according circumstances latter case fight ramparts camp walls fortress roman says roman proverb conquers sitting still 
origin manipular legion new military organization main roman rate italian remodelling improvement old hellenic tactics phalanx plain

earlier times indeed existed landed estates least comparatively large size management farming large scale simply husbandry numerous small parcels 
hand enactment law incompatible indeed earlier mode management yet far appropriate later viz 
landholder bound employ along slaves proportional number free persons may well regarded oldest trace later centralized farming estates deserves notice even first emergence essentially rests slave holding

inland intercourse italy respecting internal intercourse italians written authorities silent coins alone furnish information 
already mentioned italy exception greek cities etruscan populonia coinage first three centuries rome cattle first instance subsequently copper weight served medium exchange

communities subsisted side side formal independence legally monetary standard entirely local territory every city monetary system 
nevertheless standards copper coinage central northern italy may comprehended three groups within coins common intercourse seem treated homogeneous

hellenes undoubtedly italians derived custom embellishing tombs moderate means fine discernment greeks confined practice case within narrow limits stretched italy barbaric opulence barbaric extravagance far beyond original proper bounds

homely samnite character hand remained times stranger foolish luxury absence greek pottery tombs exhibits quite palpably absence samnite coinage slight development commercial intercourse urban life region

closely connected subject already mentioned interdicts law twelve tables fulminated purple bier cloths gold ornaments placed beside dead banishment silver plate excepting salt cellar sacrificial ladle roman household far least sumptuary laws terror censorial censure could banish even architecture shall encounter spirit hostility luxury whether noble ignoble 
although however consequence influences rome probably preserved certain outward simplicity longer capua volsinii commerce trade fact along agriculture prosperity beginning rested must regarded inconsiderable less sensibly experienced influence new commanding position
