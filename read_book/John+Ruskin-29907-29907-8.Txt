preface second edition 
allowed able writers naval military tactics although attack successive divisions absolutely requires attacking party inherent superiority quality force consciousness superiority may enable front columns leading ships support considerable period overwhelming numbers yet insures maintained constancy total ruin opposing force 
convinced truth therefore assured ultimate prevalence victory principles advocated equally confident strength cause must give weight strokes even weakest defenders permitted yield somewhat hasty hot headed desire whatever risk thick fire began contest part weakest least considerable part forces disposal 
find volume thus boldly laid public position much resembling royal sovereign trafalgar receiving unsupported broadsides half enemy fleet unforeseen circumstances hitherto prevented must yet time prevent heavier ships line taking part action 
watched first moments struggle anxiety solitary vessel anxiety ceased feel flag truth waves brightly smoke battle antagonists wholly intent destruction leading ship lost position exposed defenceless disorder attack following columns 
however reason regret hasty advance far regards ultimate issue struggle yet found occasion much misconception character diminution influence present essay 
though work received sanguine moments ventured hope though pleasure knowing many instances principles carried strength conviction amounting demonstration truth even influence excited interest suggested inquiry prompted frank comparison art nature yet effect would greater still work supposed seems many readers completed treatise containing systematized statement whole views subject modern art 
considered surprises book received slightest attention 
respect could due writer pretended criticise classify works great painters landscape without developing even alluding one single principle beautiful sublime far completed essay little introduction mass evidence illustration yet bring forward treats nothing initiatory steps art states nothing elementary rules criticism touches merits attainable accuracy eye fidelity hand leaves future consideration every one eclectic qualities pictures good prompted feeling great guided judgment function scope less mistaken carefully arranged subject commencement given frequent references throughout essays intended succeeded shall endeavor point signification value phenomena external nature hitherto compelled describe without reference either inherent beauty lessons may derived 
yet prevent misconception future may perhaps excused occupying reader time fuller statement feelings work undertaken general plan conclusions positions hope able finally deduce maintain

therefore would maintain cause contemporary excellence elder time must almost every class men arrayed 
generous would find matter accusation established dignities envious like sound living man praise wise prefer opinion centuries days foolish incapable forming opinion 
obloquy universal lightly risked make effort stem torrent made commonly favor works deserve contempt reward 
regretted influence progress preservation things technical communicable 
respect ancients salvation art though sometimes blinds us ends 
increases power painter though diminishes liberty sometimes incumbrance essays invention oftener protection consequences audacity 
whole system discipline art collected results experience ages might fixed authority antiquity swept away rage fashion lost glare novelty knowledge taken centuries accumulate principles mighty minds arrived dying might overthrown frenzy faction abandoned insolence hour 
neither general application persuasion superiority former works less useful 
greater number must immeasurably nobler results present effort best productions four thousand years must necessarily accumulation beyond rivalry works given generation always remembered improbable many impossible works though greatest yet produced approach abstract perfection certainly something left us carry farther complete given generation chance producing individual mind first rate calibre predecessors mind arise chances assistance experience example would particular chosen path greater things done 
must therefore cautious lose sight real use left us antiquity take model perfection many cases guide 
picture looked interpretation nature invaluable picture taken substitute nature better burned young artist shrink horror iconoclast would tear every landmark light bequeathed ancients leave liberated childhood may equally certain betrayed would give power knowledge past time fetter strength advance bend eyes backward beaten path would thrust canvas sky tradition god 
conventional teaching dreaded highest art creative imaginative formed created every great master repeated imitated others 
judge excellence rising writer much resemblance works done difference advise first trials strength set certain models respect inferior points one versification another arrangement another treatment yet admit greatness broken away models struck forth versification arrangement treatment 
three points therefore would especially insist upon necessary kept mind criticism modern art 
first even best productions antiquity visibly palpably imperfect kind way conceivably improvable farther study every nation perhaps every generation probability peculiar gift particular character mind enabling something different something sort better done therefore unless art trick manufacture secrets lost greatest minds existing nations exerted industry passion honest aim past time chance particular walk something great taking advantage former example account even greater better 
difficult conceive laws logic reviewers following essay construed first sentence denial principle denial conventional shallow criticism modern works invariably implies 
said nothing centuries consecrated public admiration without possessing high degree species sterling excellence 
thence follow possesses highest degree every species sterling excellence yet thus says sapient reviewer admits fact mainly argues namely superiority time honored productions 
possession abstract excellence kind necessarily implied possession incomparable excellence every kind works man perfect admit conception excelled thousands centuries centuries consecrated public admiration yet imperfect many respects excelled may excelled 
opponents mean assert nothing good ever bettered best past time necessarily best time perugino suppose possessed species sterling excellence perugino excelled raffaelle claude possesses species sterling excellence follows may excelled turner 
second point would insist mind arise power capable equalling excelling greatest works past ages productions mind would probability totally different manner matter former productions powerful intellect less works resemble men whether predecessors contemporaries 
instead reasoning therefore commonly matters art work resemble hitherto canon therefore must inferior wrong principle let us rather admit dissimilarity increased chance new perhaps higher canon 
production modern art shown authority nature side based eternal truths much favor much farther proof power totally different seen 
b third point would insist mind arise would necessarily divide world criticism two factions one necessarily largest loudest composed men incapable judging except precedent ignorant general truth acquainted particular truths may illustrated pointed former works class would course violent vituperation increase animosity master departed farther particular preconceived canons right thus wounding vanity impugning judgment necessarily narrow number composed men general knowledge unbiassed habits thought would recognize work daring innovator record illustration facts unseized would justly candidly estimate value truths rendered would increase fervor admiration master strode farther deeper daringly dominions unsearched unknown yet diminishing multitude increased enthusiasm much leader became impatient step impetuous success exalted research much must number capable following become narrower last supposing never pause advance might left culminating moment consummate achievement faithful side former disciples fallen away former enemies doubled numbers virulence evidence supremacy wrought devotion men lives earnest study new truths discovered recorded

higher end view one may think justify sacrifice time calling readers follow investigation far laborious could adequately rewarded mere insight merits particular master spirit particular age 
question spite claims painting called sister poetry appears admit considerable doubt whether art ever except earliest rudest stages possessed anything like efficient moral influence mankind

painting nothing language 
painting art generally technicalities difficulties particular ends nothing noble expressive language invaluable vehicle thought nothing 
learned commonly considered whole art painting art representing natural object faithfully yet learned language thoughts expressed 
done much towards ought respect great painter man learned express grammatically melodiously towards great poet 
language indeed difficult acquirement one case possesses power delighting sense speaks intellect nevertheless nothing language excellences peculiar painter merely rhythm melody precision force words orator poet necessary greatness tests greatness 
mode representing saying represented said respective greatness either painter writer finally determined 

painter term corresponding versifier 
speaking strict propriety therefore call man great painter excelled precision force language lines great versifier excelled precision force language words 
great poet would term strictly precisely sense applicable warranted character images thoughts respective languages convey

part decorative little intrinsic excellence picture frame varnishing 
caution distinguishing ornamental expressive peculiarly necessary painting language words nearly impossible expressive beautiful except mere rhythm melody sacrifice immediately stigmatized error

thus falsely said great men waste lofty powers unworthy objects object may dangerous useless far phrase reference difficulty performance unworthy power brings exertion nothing become subject action greater power accomplished less bodily strength exerted nothing resist 
men may let great powers lie dormant employ mean petty powers mean petty objects physically impossible employ great power except great object 
consequently wherever power kind degree exerted marks evidence stamped upon results impossible lost wasted without record even estimation hair therefore whatever subject great power bears image created commonly called excellent

chapter v ideas truth 
word truth applied art signifies faithful statement either mind senses fact nature 

meaning word truth applied art 
receive idea truth perceive faithfulness statement 
difference ideas truth imitation lies chiefly following points 

first difference truth imitation 
first imitation something material truth reference statements qualities material things emotions impressions thoughts 
moral well material truth truth impression well form thought well matter truth impression thought thousand times important two 
hence truth term universal application imitation limited narrow field art takes cognizance material things 

second difference 
secondly truth may stated signs symbols definite signification minds addressed although signs image likeness anything 
whatever excite mind conception certain facts give ideas truth though degree imitation resemblance facts 
say painting anything operates words resembling anything taken symbol substitute thus inducing effect channel communication convey uncorrupted truth though degree resemble facts whose conception induces 
ideas imitation course require likeness object 
speak perceptive faculties truth conceptive 

third difference 
thirdly consequence stated idea truth exists statement one attribute anything idea imitation requires resemblance many attributes usually cognizant real presence 
pencil outline bough tree white paper statement certain number facts form 
yet amount imitation anything 
idea form given nature lines still less black lines white space 
lines convey mind distinct impression certain number facts recognizes agreeable previous impressions bough tree receives therefore idea truth 
instead two lines give dark form brush convey information certain relation shade bough sky recognizable another idea truth still imitation white paper least like air black shadow like wood 
certain number ideas truth collected together arrive idea imitation 

accurate truths necessary imitation 
hence might first sight appear idea imitation inasmuch several ideas truth united nobler simple idea truth 
necessary ideas truth perfect subjects contemplation would 
observe require produce effect imitation many ideas truth senses usually cognizant 
senses usually unless especially devoted service cognizant accuracy truths space projection 
requires long study attention give certain evidence even simplest truths form 
instance quay figure sitting hand eyes claude seaport national gallery egregiously perspective 
eye artist study thus acquired power taking cognizance apparent form even simple parallelopiped 
much less complicated forms boughs leaves limbs although therefore something resembling real form necessary deception something called truth form strictly speaking degrees truth degrees approach approach whose feebleness imperfection would instantly offend give pain mind really capable distinguishing truth yet quite sufficient purposes deceptive imagination 
regard color 
paint tree sky blue dog rose pink discernment public would keen enough discover falsehood much approach truth color may come common idea men minds say trees bright green flesh unbroken buff ground unbroken brown though real refined truths color wholly omitted rather defied contradicted yet quite enough purposes imitation 
facts usually certainly cognizant distance projection tolerably given something like truth form color assist idea imitation complete 
would undertake paint arm every muscle place every bone false form dislocated articulation yet observe certain coarse broad resemblances true outline careful shading would induce deception draw praise delight discerning public

place proof present insist last greatest distinction ideas truth imitation mind receiving one former dwells upon conception fact form feeling stated occupied qualities character fact form considering real existing totally regardless signs symbols notion conveyed 
signs pretence hypocrisy legerdemain nothing found sifted surprised bear message simply clearly message mind takes dwells upon regardless language delivered

ideas beauty 

definition term beautiful 
material object give us pleasure simple contemplation outward qualities without direct definite exertion intellect call way degree beautiful 
receive pleasure forms colors others asked answered like sugar dislike wormwood 
utmost subtilty investigation lead us ultimate instincts principles human nature farther reason given simple deity created 
may indeed perceive far acquainted nature constructed healthy cultivated state mind derive pleasure whatever things illustrative nature receive pleasure illustrative perception illustrative instinctively necessarily derive sensual pleasure scent rose 
primary principles nature education accident operate unlimited extent may cultivated checked directed diverted gifted right guidance acute faultless sense subjected neglect every phase error disease 
followed natural laws aversion desire rendering authoritative constant obedience derive pleasure always god originally intended give pleasure derives greatest possible sum pleasure given object man taste 

definition term taste 
real meaning disputed word 
perfect taste faculty receiving greatest possible pleasure material sources attractive moral nature purity perfection 
receives little pleasure sources wants taste receives pleasure sources false bad taste 

distinction taste judgment 
thus term taste distinguished judgment constantly confounded 
judgment general term expressing definite action intellect applicable every kind subject submitted 
may judgment congruity judgment truth judgment justice judgment difficulty excellence 
exertions intellect totally distinct taste properly called instinctive instant preferring one material object another without obvious reason except proper human nature perfection 

far beauty may become intellectual 
observe however mean excluding direct exertion intellect ideas beauty assert beauty effect upon connection intellect 
moral feelings woven intellectual powers affect one without degree addressing high ideas beauty probable much pleasure depends delicate untraceable perceptions fitness propriety relation purely intellectual arrive noblest ideas commonly rightly called intellectual beauty 
yet immediate exertion intellect say person receiving even noblest ideas simple beauty asked likes object exciting able give distinct reason trace mind formed thought appeal source pleasure 
say thing gratifies fills hallows exalts mind able say 
show perceives object expression distinct thought received idea beauty idea relation 

high rank function ideas beauty 
ideas beauty among noblest presented human mind invariably exalting purifying according degree would appear intended deity constantly influence one single object nature capable conveying rightly perceiving mind present incalculably greater number beautiful deformed parts fact scarcely anything pure undiseased nature like positive deformity degrees beauty slight rare points permitted contrast may render around valuable opposition spots blackness creation make colors felt 

meaning term ideal beauty 
although everything nature less beautiful every species object kind degree beauty nature beautiful others individuals possessing utmost degree beauty species capable 
utmost degree specific beauty necessarily coexistent utmost perfection object respects ideal object 
ideas beauty remembered subjects moral intellectual perception 
investigation shall led knowledge ideal subjects art 
chapter vii 
ideas relation 

general meaning term 
use term rather one convenience adequately expressive vast class ideas wish comprehended namely conveyable art subjects distinct intellectual perception action therefore worthy name thoughts 
every thought definite exertion intellect implies two subjects connection relation inferred term ideas relation incorrect though inexpressive 

ideas comprehended 
head must arranged everything productive expression sentiment character whether figures landscapes may much definite expression marked carrying particular thoughts treatment inanimate animate nature everything relating conception subject congruity relation parts enhance beauty known constant laws composition give expression meaning particular application requiring distinct thought discover enjoy choice instance particular lurid appalling light illustrate incident terrible particular tone pure color prepare mind expression refined delicate feeling still higher sense invention incidents thoughts expressed words well canvas totally independent means art may serve bare suggestion 
principal object foreground turner building carthage group children sailing toy boats

subdivision extensive class necessary 
ideas relation course respect art generally extensive important source pleasure proposed entering upon criticism historical works would absurd attempt without subdivision arrangement 
old landscape painters got much canvas without either exercise appeal intellect shall little troubled subject far concerned whatever subdivision may adopt therefore particular reference works modern artists better understood obtained knowledge less important points 
term ideas relation mean future express sources pleasure involve require instant perception active exertion intellectual powers

power 
chapter general principles respecting ideas power 

necessity detailed study ideas imitation 
seen last section classes ideas may conveyed art able far appreciate relative worth see list applied purposes legitimate criticism may throw ideas imitation first shown unworthy pursuit artist secondly nothing result particular association ideas truth 
examining truth art therefore shall compelled take notice particular truths whose association gives rise ideas imitation 
shall see clearly meanness truths shall find able use tests vice art saying picture deceives therefore must bad 

separate study ideas power 
ideas power way completely viewed separate class mean unimportant almost always associated dependent upon higher ideas truth beauty relation rendered decision velocity 
power delights us chalk sketch great painter one fingers like writing master mere dexterity hand 
accuracy certainty knowledge rendered evident rapid fearless expression real source pleasure upon difficulty art whether know relate invent sensation power attendant see difficulty totally swiftly vanquished 
hence determine otherwise desirable art shall gradually develop sources ideas power anything difficult otherwise desirable must afterwards considered separately 

except one particular form 
necessary present notice particular form ideas power partially independent knowledge truth difficulty apt corrupt judgment critic debase work artist 
evident conception power receive calculation unseen difficulty estimate unseen strength never impressive receive present sensation sight one resisting overwhelming 
one case power imagined felt 

two modes receiving ideas power commonly inconsistent 
thus two modes receive conception power one perfect knowledge difficulty overcome means employed form right estimate faculties exerted without possessing intimate accurate knowledge impressed sensation power visible action 
two modes receiving impression agree result sensation equal estimate receive utmost possible idea power 
case perhaps works one man whole circle fathers art referred michael angelo 
others estimate sensation constantly unequal often contradictory 

first reason inconsistency 
first reason inconsistency order receive sensation power must see operation 
victory therefore must achieved achieving therefore imperfect 
thus receive greater sensation power half hewn limbs twilight day cappella de medici even divine inebriety bacchus gallery greater life dashed along friezes parthenon polished limbs apollo greater ink sketch head raffaelle st catherine perfection realization 

second reason inconsistency 
another reason inconsistency sensation power proportion apparent inadequacy means end impression much greater partial success attained slight effort perfect success attained greater proportional effort 
art every touch effort individually less proportion work approaches perfection 
first five chalk touches bring head existence nothing 
five touches whole course work ever much difference made touch imperceptible work approaches completion 
consequently ratio means employed effect produced constantly decreasing therefore least sensation power received perfect work 

sensation power ought sought imperfect art 
thus evident sensations power imperfect art right art far goes must always wanting perfection sources pleasure hasty sketch rough hewn block partially wanting tinted canvas polished marble 
nevertheless wrong prefer sensation power intellectual perception 
reality greater power completion commencement though manifest senses ought higher influence mind therefore praising pictures ideas power convey must look keenest sensation highest estimate accompanied much sensation compatible thus shall consider pictures conveying highest ideas power attain perfect end slightest possible means observe though much done little done picture done yet touch thrown away 
quantity work sketch necessarily less proportion effect obtained picture yet picture involves greater power additional labor bestowed touch lost 

instances pictures modern artists 
instance drawings present day involve greater sensations power frederick tayler 
every dash tells quantity effect obtained enormous proportion apparent means 
effect obtained complete 
brilliant beautiful right sketch work still far perfection drawing 
contrary drawings present day bear evidence labor bestowed complicated means employed john lewis 
result first much convey impression inherent power prolonged exertion result complete 
water color drawing carried farther nothing left unfinished untold 
examination means employed found felt one touch thousands employed thrown away one dot dash could spared without loss effect exertion swift prolonged bold persevering 
power involved picture highest order enduring pleasure following estimate pure 

connection ideas power modes execution 
still farther ground caution pursuing sensation power connected particular characters modes execution 
shall better able understand briefly reviewing various excellences may belong execution give pleasure though full determination desirable critical examination execution different artists must deferred immediately seen fully acquainted principles truth 
chapter ii 
ideas power dependent upon execution 

meaning term execution 
term execution understand right mechanical use means art produce given end 

first quality execution truth 
qualities execution properly called influenced great degree dependent far higher power mere execution knowledge truth 
exactly proportion artist certain end swift simple means accurate deep knowledge refined precise touch 
first merit manipulation delicate ceaseless expression refined truth carried last touch shadow touch makes every hairsbreadth importance every gradation full meaning 
properly speaking execution source difference execution commonplace perfect artist 
lowest draughtsman spent time handling brush may equal highest qualities execution swiftness simplicity decision truth 
perfection precision instantaneous line claim immortality laid 
truth truths present qualities execution may well spared artists wish excuse ignorance inaccuracy species execution perpetual proclamation qu ils n ont demeur qu un quart heure le faire may reply truthful alceste monsieur le temps ne fait rien l affaire 

second simplicity 
second quality execution simplicity 
unpretending quiet retiring means impressive effect 
ostentation brilliancy pretension touch exhibition power quickness merely attempt render lines attractive expense meaning vice 

third mystery 
third mystery 
nature always mysterious secret use means art always likest inexplicable 
execution incomprehensible therefore defies imitation qualities supposed alike best 

fourth inadequacy fifth decision 
fourth inadequacy 
less sufficient means appear end greater already noticed sensation power 
fifth decision appearance whatever done done fearlessly gives us impression fact represented means necessary representation perfectly known 

sixth velocity 
sixth velocity 
velocity appearance agreeable decision gives ideas power knowledge two touches nearly possible respects quickest invariably best 
truth supposed equally present shape direction evenness grace variety quick one slow one 
agreeable eye touch line possess qualities lines nature gradation uncertainty unity 

strangeness illegitimate source pleasure execution 
six qualities perfectly legitimate sources pleasure execution might added seventh strangeness many cases productive pleasure altogether mean degrading though scarcely right 
supposing higher qualities first secured adds small degree impression artist knowledge means used never thought thought adapted contrary effect 
let us instance compare execution bull head left hand lowest corner adoration magi museum antwerp berghem landscape dulwich gallery 
rubens first scratches horizontally canvas thin grayish brown transparent even much color light wainscot horizontal strokes bristles left evident whole might taken imitation wood transparency 
ground eye nostril outline cheek given two three rude brown touches three four minutes work though head colossal 
background laid thick solid warm white actually projecting round head leaving dark intaglio 
finally five thin scratchy strokes cold bluish white struck high light forehead nose head complete 
seen within yard canvas looks actually transparent flimsy meaningless distant shadow background looks solid projecting near 
right distance ten twelve yards whence alone whole picture seen complete rich substantial living realization projecting head animal background falls far behind 
slight mean pleasure perceiving result attained means strange 
berghem hand dark background first laid exquisite delicacy transparency cow head actually modelled luminous white separate locks hair projecting canvas 
surprise much pleasure kind would attendant execution even result equally successful little pleasure vanishes retiring picture find head shining like distant lantern instead substantial near 
yet strangeness considered legitimate source pleasure 
means conducive end always pleasurable conducive end strange ignorance spectator 
kind pleasure illegitimate therefore implies requires feel ignorance art 

yet even legitimate sources pleasure execution inconsistent 

fondness ideas power leads adoption lowest 

therefore perilous 
legitimate sources pleasure execution therefore truth simplicity mystery inadequacy decision velocity 
observed far inconsistent others united high degrees 
mystery inadequacy instance since see means inadequate must see 
first three great qualities execution last three attractive ones chiefly attendant ideas power 
first three attention withdrawn means fixed result last three withdrawn result fixed means 
see execution swift decided must look away creation observe act creating must think pallet picture simplicity mystery compel mind leave means fix conception 
hence danger great fondness sensations power associated three last qualities execution although desirable present far consistent others though visible absence always painful wrong yet moment higher qualities sacrificed least degree brilliant vice 
berghem salvator rosa good instances vicious execution dependent great fondness sensations power vicious intrusive attractive instead subordinate results forgotten 
perhaps greater stumbling block artist way tendency sacrifice truth simplicity decision velocity captivating qualities easy attainment sure attract attention praise delicate degree truth first sacrificed totally unappreciable majority spectators difficult attainment artist wonder efforts arduous unrewarded abandoned 
temptation yielded consequences fatal pause fall 
could name celebrated modern artist man highest power promise glaring instance peril course 
misled undue popularity swift execution sacrificed first precision truth associate beauty 
first neglect nature become contradiction imperfection falsehood meritorious manner becoming worst attractive vices decision without foundation swiftness without end 

recapitulation 
principal modes ideas power may become dangerous attraction artist false test critic 
cases lead us astray found error caused preferring victory small apparent difficulty victory great concealed one keep distinction constantly view whether reference execution quality art sensation intellectual estimate power shall always find ideas power high source pleasure every kind grade art 
footnotes noticed noble vices sacrifices one excellence another legitimate inferior one 
hand qualities execution often sought praised though scarcely class persons writing everything sacrificed illegitimate contemptible sources pleasure vice throughout redeeming quality excusing aim

chapter ideas truth connection beauty relation 

two great ends landscape painting representation facts thoughts 
evident division ideas conveyable art landscape painter must always two great distinct ends first induce spectator mind faithful conception natural objects whatsoever second guide spectator mind objects worthy contemplation inform thoughts feelings regarded artist 
attaining first end painter places spectator stands sets landscape leaves 
spectator alone 
may follow thoughts would natural solitude may remain untouched unreflecting regardless disposition may incline 
nothing thought given new ideas unknown feelings forced attention heart 
artist conveyance companion horse friend 
attaining second end artist places spectator talks makes sharer strong feelings quick thoughts hurries away enthusiasm guides beautiful snatches base leaves delighted ennobled instructed sense beheld new scene held communion new mind endowed time keen perception impetuous emotion nobler penetrating intelligence 

induce different choice material subjects 
different aims art necessitate different system choice objects represented 
first indeed imply choice usually united selection objects may naturally constantly pleasing men times selection perfect careful leads attainment pure ideal 
artist aiming second end selects objects meaning character rather beauty uses rather throw light upon particular thought wishes convey objects unconnected admiration 

first mode selection apt produce sameness repetition 
although first mode selection guided deep reflection may rise production works possessing noble ceaseless influence human mind likely degenerate rather nine cases ten never goes beyond mere appeal parts animal nature constant common shared perpetual instance pleasure eye opposition cold warm color massy form delicate one 
also tends induce constant repetition ideas reference principles gives rise rules art properly excited reynolds indignation applied higher efforts source apology host technicalities absurdities ages curse art crown connoisseur 

second necessitating variety 
art second highest aim appeal constant animal feelings expression awakening individual thought therefore various extended efforts compass grasp directing mind feel results looking specimen tradesman wares ready make us dozen match one coruscation perpetually active mind like another 

yet first delightful 

second 
hence although doubt branches art highest equally evident first generally felt appreciated 
simple statement truths nature must pleasing every order mind every truth nature less beautiful right selection important truths based explained feelings desires common mankind facts selected must degree delightful value appreciable less indeed senses instinct rendered less acute accurate use study degree way 
highest art based sensations peculiar minds sensations occurring particular times plurality mankind perhaps never expressive thoughts could rise mass extended knowledge dispositions modified thousand ways peculiarity intellect met understood persons sort sympathy high solitary minds produced sympathy felt minds degree high solitary 
alone appreciate art could comprehend conversation painter share emotion moments fiery passion original thought 
whereas true meaning end art must thus sealed thousands misunderstood also sometimes obliged working peculiar end set defiance constant laws arisen lower changeless desires whose purpose unseen frequently means parts displeasing 

first necessary second 

exceeding importance truth 
want extended influence high art especially observed proceeds want truth art want sympathy spectator feelings artist prompt utterance one truth rather another 
wish present especially insist upon although possible reach stated first end art representation facts without reaching second representation thoughts yet altogether impossible reach second without previously reached first 
say man think false basis material thought false thought worse want thought therefore art 
reason though consider second real important end art call representation facts first end necessary must attained 
foundation art like real foundations may little thought brilliant fabric raised must buildings beautiful unless every line column mass reference foundation suggestive existence strength nothing beautiful art parts suggest guide foundation even undecorated portion visible noblest edifices art built pure fine crystal foundation may seen many see built upon first story yet much admire solidity brickwork thinking understand understood matter others stand beside looking low story heaven building crystal builder spirit dwelling 
thus though want thoughts feelings artist well truth yet must thoughts arising knowledge truth feelings raising contemplation truth 
want mind badly blown glass distorts see like glass sweet strange color gives new tones see glass rare strength clearness let us see could bring nature us near us 
nothing atone want truth brilliant imagination playful fancy pure feeling supposing feeling could pure false time exalted conception comprehensive grasp intellect make amends want truth two reasons first falsehood revolting degrading secondly nature immeasurably superior human mind conceive every departure fall beneath thing ornamental falsehood 
falsehood must blot well sin injury well deception 

coldness want beauty sign truth 
shall consequence find artist graceful imaginative original unless truthful pursuit beauty instead leading us away truth increases desire necessity tenfold artists really great imaginative power found based boldness conception mass knowledge far exceeding possessed pride accumulation without regarding use 
coldness want passion picture signs accuracy paucity statements true vigor brilliancy signs audacity knowledge 

truth may considered criterion art 
hence follows power care time form something like judgment relative merits artists although respect feeling passion pictures often impossible criticise appreciate except degree equal powers mind respects modes mind whose works judge yet respect representation facts possible attention form right judgment respective powers attainments every artist 
truth bar comparison may examined according rank take examination almost invariably capable appreciating every respect assigning strict connection constant relation sum knowledge extent thought accuracy perception vividness idea 
shall endeavor therefore present portion work enter care impartiality investigation claims schools ancient modern landscape faithfulness representing nature 
shall pay regard whatsoever may thought beautiful sublime imaginative 
shall look truth bare clear downright statement facts showing particular far able truth nature seeking plain expression alone 
shall thus endeavor totally regardless fervor imagination brilliancy effect captivating qualities examine judge works great living painter believe imagined majority public paint falsehood less fact known master 
shall see reason

common self deception men respect power discerning truth 
may inquired reader much appearance reason think necessary devote separate portion work showing truthful art 
say public see nature eyes find like well determine question go farther possible would little need criticism teaching respect art 
said possible men care attention form judgment fidelity artists nature 
peculiar powers mind required sympathy particular feelings nothing every man ordinary intellect degree possess powers namely observation intelligence cultivation may brought high degree perfection acuteness 
cultivation bestowed instrument thereby perfected employed consistent series careful observation absurd audacious pretend form judgment whatsoever respecting truth art first business going step farther must combat nearly universal error belief among thoughtless unreflecting know either nature like discover truth instinct minds pure venice glass shocked treachery

men usually see little eyes 
first great mistake people make matter supposition must see thing eyes 
forget great truth told locke book ii

certain whatever alterations made body reach mind whatever impressions made outward parts taken notice within perception 
fire may burn bodies effect billet unless motion continued brain sense heat idea pain produced mind wherein consists actual perception 
often may man observe mind intently employed contemplation subjects curiously surveying ideas takes notice impressions sounding bodies made upon organ hearing attention uses producing ideas sound sufficient impulse may organ reaching observation mind follows perception though motion uses produce idea sound made ear yet sound heard

thus unless minds men particularly directed impressions sight objects pass perpetually eyes without conveying impression brain pass actually unseen merely unnoticed full clear sense word unseen 
numbers men pre occupied business care description totally unconnected impressions sight actually case receiving nature inevitable sensations blueness redness darkness light etc except particular rare moments whatsoever 

less proportion natural sensibility beautiful 

connected perfect state moral feeling 
degree ignorance external nature men may thus remain depends therefore partly number character subjects minds may otherwise occupied partly natural want sensibility power beauty form attributes external objects 
think ever absolute incapacity eye distinguishing receiving pleasure certain forms colors persons technically said ear distinguishing notes naturally every degree bluntness acuteness perceiving truth form receiving pleasure perceived 
although believe even lowest degree faculties expanded almost unlimitedly cultivation pleasure received rewards labor necessary pursuit abandoned 
whose sensations naturally acute vivid call external nature strong must obeyed ever heard louder approach nearer whose sensations naturally blunt call overpowered thoughts faculties perception weak originally die disuse 
kind bodily sensibility color form intimately connected higher sensibility revere one chief attributes noble minds chief spring real poetry 
believe kind sensibility may entirely resolved acuteness bodily sense speaking associated love love mean infinite holy functions embraces divine human brutal intelligences hallows physical perception external objects association gratitude veneration pure feelings moral nature 
although discovery truth altogether intellectual dependent merely powers physical perception abstract intellect wholly independent moral nature yet instruments perception judgment sharpened brightened far swiftly effectively used energy passion moral nature bring action perception quickened love judgment tempered veneration practically man deadened moral sensation always dull perception truth thousands highest divine truths nature wholly concealed however constant indefatigable may intellectual search 
thus farther look limited number choose appeal judges truth perceive great number mankind may partially incapacitated either discovering feeling

man may receive impression impression vividly delight yet take care reason upon impressions trace sources may remain totally ignorant facts produced nay may attribute facts connection may coin causes existence

chapter iii 
relative importance truths first particular truths important general ones 

necessity determining relative importance truths 
last chapter affirmed usually recognize objects least essential characteristics 
naturally excites inquiry consider important characteristics call one truth important another 
question must immediately determined evident judging truth painters shall consider accuracy individual truths given relative importance truths constantly happens powers art unable render truths artist must considered truthful preserved important expense trifling 

misapplication aphorism general truths important particular ones 

falseness maxim taken without explanation 

generality important subject particularity predicate 
begin investigation aristotle way look greek phainomena subject shall immediately stumble maxim everybody mouth understood practice true useful usually applied argument false misleading 
general truths important particular ones 
often conversation praising turner perpetual variety giving particular separate character compositions mind painter estimated seeing ever done nothing prophesied picture coming existence easel totally different idea ever done opposed inexhaustible knowledge imagination whichever may perpetual repetition half dozen conceptions claude poussin met formidable objection enunciated much dignity self satisfaction part antagonist painting general truths painting particular truths 
must something wrong application principle would make variety abundance look greatest sign intellect writer greatest sign error painter shall accordingly see application matters taken without limitation whole proposition utterly false 
instance mrs jameson somewhere mentions exclamation lady acquaintance desirous fill pause conversation abundant sources observation excellent book bible general truth indeed truth predicable bible common many books certainly neither striking important 
lady exclaimed evidently bible divine revelation would expressed particular truth one predicable bible certainly far interesting important 
contrary informed us bible book would still general still less entertaining 
ask one somebody else receive answer man get little satisfaction pains told sir isaac newton immediately thank neighbor information 
fact instances may serve prove self evident generality gives importance subject limitation particularity predicate 
say man china opium eater say nothing interesting subject man particular 
say men china opium eaters say something interesting subject men general 
say men china eat say nothing interesting predicate eat general 
say men china eat opium say something interesting predicate eat opium particular 
almost everything reference given subject painter ask whether shall represent predicate 
hence art particular truths usually important general ones 
anything plain contradicted one universally received aphorisms respecting art little reflection show us limitations maxim may true practice 

importance truths species owing generality 

truths valuable characteristic 
self evident painting describing anything truths must important characteristic told represented 
first broadly characteristic thing distinguishes genus makes 
instance makes drapery drapery made silk worsted flax things made drapery ideas peculiar drapery properties inherent thing make drapery extension non elastic flexibility unity comparative thinness 
everything properties waterfall instance united extended net weeds wall drapery much silk woollen stuff 
ideas separate drapery minds everything else peculiarly characteristic therefore important group ideas connected everything else makes thing important idea group ideas connected thing 
idea must necessarily common individuals species belongs general idea respect species ideas characteristic species therefore reality general black white terms applicable things drapery yet particular respect species predicable certain individuals 
hence carelessly falsely said general ideas important particular ones carelessly falsely say called general idea important common individuals species separates species everything else 
distinctiveness universality truth renders important 
called particular idea unimportant predicable whole species predicable things species 
individuality generality renders unimportant 
truths important proportion characteristic valuable primarily separate species created things secondarily separate individuals species one another thus silken woollen unimportant ideas respect drapery neither separate species things even individuals species one another since though common whole common indefinite numbers particular folds piece drapery may happen fall different many particulars piece drapery fall expressive characters species flexibility non elasticity etc individuality definite character case immediately observed consequently important necessary ideas 
man short legged long nosed anything else accidental quality distinguish short legged long nosed animals important truths respecting man first marked development distinctive organization separates man animals secondly group qualities distinguish individual men make paul judas newton shakspeare 

otherwise truths species valuable beautiful 
real sources importance truths far considered reference merely general particular sources importance give farther weight ordinary opinion greater value general render opinion right practice mean intrinsic beauty truths quality place investigate must noticed invariably adding value truths species rather individuality 
qualities properties characterize man animal species perfection form mind almost individual differences arising imperfections hence truth species valuable art must always beauty truth individuals commonly sort way defect 

many truths valuable separate may objectionable connection others 
truth may great interest object viewed may objectionable viewed relation objects 
thus painting piece drapery whole subject would proper give every source entertainment particular truths could supply give varied color delicate texture paint piece drapery part dress madonna ideas richness texture become thoroughly contemptible unfit occupy mind moment idea virgin 
conception drapery suggested simplest slightest means possible notions texture detail rejected utter reprobation observe particular general anything else respect drapery draw attention dress instead saint disturb degrade imagination feelings hence ought give conception drapery unobtrusive way possible rendering essential qualities distinctly necessary existence drapery one 
last two sources importance truths nothing present dependent upon ideas beauty relation merely allude show alleged sir j reynolds scientific writers respecting kind truths proper represented painter sculptor perfectly right yet principle base selection general truths important particular ones altogether false 
canova perseus vatican entirely spoiled unlucky tassel folds mantle next admirer canova passes would well knock spoiled particular truth contemptible unnecessary ugly truth 
button fastens vest sistine daniel much particular truth necessary one idea given simplest possible means hence right beautiful 

recapitulation 
finally remembered truths far particular general affects value valuable proportion particular valueless proportion general express proposition simpler terms every truth valuable proportion characteristic thing affirmed 
chapter iv 
relative importance truths secondly rare truths important frequent ones 

accidental violation nature principles represented 
necessary next us determine far frequency rarity affect importance truths whether artist considered truthful paints common unusual nature 
whole determination question depends upon whether unusual fact violation nature general principles application principles peculiar striking way 
nature sometimes though rarely violates principles principle make everything beautiful instant permits compared rest works might called ugly true even rare blemishes permitted said good purpose part sec 
chap 
valuable nature used uses equally valuable instantaneous discords art artist seek exclusively paint nothing else though might able point something nature original every one uglinesses would yet strict sense word false false nature disobedient laws 
instance practice nature give character outlines clouds perpetual angles right lines 
perhaps month diligent watching might able see cloud altogether rounded made curves artist paints nothing curved clouds must yet considered thoroughly inexcusably false 

cases principles strikingly exemplified

though nature constantly beautiful exhibit highest powers beauty constantly would satiate us pall upon senses 
necessary appreciation rarely shown 
finest touches things must watched perfect passages beauty evanescent

evanescent passages perfected beauty perpetually varied examples utmost power artist ought seek arrest 
supposition absurd effects truths frequently exhibited characteristic nature equally necessary laws though rarer occurrence 
frequent rare parts great system give either exclusively imperfect truth repeat effect thought two pictures wasted life 
think poet keep life repeating thought different words lenient parrot painter learned one lesson page nature keeps stammering eternal repetition without turning leaf less tautology describe thing lines words teaching nature varied infinite constant duty painter watch every one lessons give human life admit nothing manifested principles peculiar striking way 
deeper research rarer phenomena noted valuable works repeat even single instance treachery nature thousand human lives would enough give one instance perfect manifestation powers combining classifying well might preacher expect one sermon express explain every divine truth gathered god revelation painter expect one composition express illustrate every lesson received god creation 
commentators infinity duty take discourse one essential truth seeking particularly insisting especially less palpable ordinary observation likely escape indolent research impress alone upon address every illustration furnished knowledge every adornment attainable power 
real truthfulness painter proportion number variety facts illustrated facts always observed realization violation general principle 
quantity truth proportion number facts value instructiveness proportion rarity 
really great pictures therefore exhibit general habits nature manifested peculiar rare beautiful way

hence proceeds prove calls primary qualities indeed part essence body characteristic two kinds qualities together calls secondary neither powers producing objects us certain effects sensations 
power influence always equally characteristic two objects active passive much necessary power object suffering receive impression object acting give impression

locke definition given bulk figure situation motion rest solid parts primary qualities 
hence truths color sink second rank

color distinction objects species 
color indeed unimportant characteristic objects farther evident slightest consideration 
color plants constantly changing season everything quality light falling nature essence thing independent changes

two trees kind season age absolutely color form anything like 
difference color two pieces rock broken place impossible form

different association alone 
color association colors different color seen

consequently color object dependent upon nature object eye beholding color objects near respect also therefore characteristic 

certain whether two people see color things 
great uncertainty respect qualities powers depend much nature object suffering object acting totally impossible prove one man sees thing color another though may use name 
one man may see yellow another sees blue effect constant agree term used call blue yellow yet totally different ideas attached term 
yet neither said see falsely color thing thing together

friend may see boars blue anything know impossible see paws instead hoofs unless eyes brain diseased

sharp separation nature lights middle tint 
singular separation great source brilliancy nature unobserved absolutely forbidden great writers art always talking connecting light shade imperceptible gradations 
surely done sunshine lost imperceptible gradation light dark characteristic objects seen sunshine landscape shadow 
nature principle getting light direct reverse 
cover whole landscape middle tint many gradations please great many paint middle tint touches extreme lights extreme darks isolated sharp eye goes directly feels key notes whole composition 
although dark touches less attractive light ones less distinct exhibit nothing bright touches parts everything seen consequence eye goes rest 
yet high lights exhibit anything bright dazzle eye shadows exhibit form form seen shadow kind another 
hence highest lights deepest darks agree nothing seen either exceedingly small quantity marked distinct middle tones landscape one brilliancy sharp edges even though many energetic middle tints may approach intensity closely

truth space first dependent focus eye 

space clearly indicated drawing objects hue 
first chapter section noticed distinction real aerial perspective overcharged contrast light shade old masters obtained deceptive effect showed though inferior precise quality tone aerial color great modern master altogether truthful expression proportionate relation distances one another 
examine modes expressing space nature art far important dependent relative hues objects drawing far important say constant certain nature always aerial 
local effects frequent interrupt violate laws aerial tone induce strange deception ideas distance 
often seen summit snowy mountain look nearer base owing perfect clearness upper air 
drawing objects say degree details parts distinct confused unfailing certain criterion distance rightly rendered painting shall genuine truth space spite many errors aerial tone neglected space destroyed whatever dexterity tint may employed conceal defective drawing 

impossible see objects unequal distances distinctly one moment 
first noticed eye like lens must focus altered order convey distinct image objects different distances totally impossible see distinctly moment two objects one much farther another 
one may convince instant 
look bars window frame get clear image lines form eye fixed perceive anything indistinct shadowy images whatever objects may visible beyond 
fix eyes objects see clearly though beyond apparently beside window frame frame felt seen vague flitting obscure interruption whatever perceived beyond 
little attention directed fact convince every one universality prove beyond dispute objects unequal distances seen together intervention air mist impossibility rays proceeding converging focus whole impression either one must necessarily confused indistinct inadequate 

especially comparatively near 
observed request whatever say may tested immediate experiment difference focus necessary greatest within first five hundred yards therefore though totally impossible see object ten yards eye one quarter mile beyond moment perfectly possible see one quarter mile one five miles beyond moment 
consequence practically real landscape see whole would called middle distance distance together facility clearness see nothing foreground beyond vague indistinct arrangement lines colors contrary look foreground object receive distinct impression distance middle distance become disorder mystery 

painting therefore either foreground distance must partially sacrificed 
therefore painting foreground anything distance must nothing vice versa represent near distant objects giving distinct image eye receive nature look separately distinguish air tone indistinctness dependent positive distance violate one essential principles nature represent seen seen two separate acts seeing tell falsehood gross represented four sides cubic object visible together 

done old masters could express space 

modern artists succeeded fully carrying principle 

especially turner 
fact principle landscape painter old school far remember ever paid slightest attention 
finishing foregrounds clearly sharply vigorous impression eye giving even leaves bushes grass perfect edge shape proceeded distance equal attention could see details gave eye perceive distance fully entirely devoted therefore though masters aerial tone though employing every expedient art could supply conceal intersection lines though caricaturing force shadow near objects throw close upon eye never succeeded truly representing space 
turner introduced new era landscape art showing foreground might sunk distance possible express immediate proximity spectator without giving anything like completeness forms near objects 
done slurred soft lines observe always sign vice art decisive imperfection firm partial assertion form eye feels indeed close home yet rest upon cling entirely understand driven away necessity parts distance intended repose 
principle originated turner though fully carried yet acted judgment success several less powerful artists english school 
six years ago brown moorland foregrounds copley fielding instructive respect 
line made single object clearly distinguishable 
wet broad sweeps brush sparkling careless accidental nature always truthful far went implying knowledge though expressing suggested everything represented nothing 
far mountain distance came sharp edge delicate form whole intention execution picture guided exerted great impression space size given 
spectator compelled go forward waste hills sun broke wide upon moor must walk wander could stumble hesitate near rocks stop botanize first inches path 
impression pictures always great enduring simple truthful 
know anything art expressed completely force feeling nature particular scenes 
farther illustration principle insisting upon later works bestowed labor foreground picture lost space sublimity 
among artists general either aware principle fear act upon requires small courage well skill treat foreground indistinctness mystery accustomed consider characteristic distance foreground felt every landscape painter confess embarrassing unmanageable part picture ninety nine cases hundred go near destroy effect rest composition 
thus callcott trent severely injured harsh group foreground figures stanfield rarely gets academy picture without destroying much space much determination near form harding constantly sacrifices distance compels spectator dwell foreground altogether though indeed foregrounds gives us happy 
turner see bold decisive choice distance middle distance great object attention foreground united adapted want drawing coarseness carelessness execution precise beautiful indication suggestion much even minutest forms eye see focus adapted 
herein another reason vigor wholeness effect turner works distance almost artists sure lose space soon lose sight details 

justification want drawing turner figures 
see reason singular ignorant art offensive execution turner figures 
mean assert reason whatsoever bad drawing though landscape matters exceedingly little reason necessity want drawing gives even nearest figures round balls four pink spots instead faces four dashes brush instead hands feet totally impossible eye adapted receive rays proceeding utmost distance partial impression distances capable perceiving forms features near figures turner gives 
absolutely necessary faithful representation space indecision really might proved utmost ease one veneration enough artist sacrifice one pictures fame would take one works figures incomplete painted delicate first rate figure painters absolutely preserving every color shade turner group lose one atom composition giving eyes pink spots feet white ones 
let picture exhibited academy even novices art would feel glance truth space gone every one beauties harmonies undergone decomposition grammatical solecism painting impossibilities thing torture eye offend mind 
footnotes left chapter original place ever convinced truth position advanced th paragraph present assign cause given asserted yet think allowed far much influence change slight insensibly make focus eye real justification turner practice respect foregrounds elsewhere sought 
leave subject therefore reader consideration 
incapacity eye must confounded incapability comprehend large portion lateral space 
indeed see one moment little one point objects beside confused indistinct need pay attention art see little picture landscape without turning eye hence slurring confusing one part laterally another founded truth nature expedient artist often excellent desirable one make eye rest wishes 
touch expressive distant object near upon canvas expressive near one seen distinctly focus eye hence immediate contradiction nature results unless one given artificial increased indistinctness expressive appearance peculiar unadapted focus 
hand must noted greater part effect described consequent variation focus different angle near objects seen two eyes directed towards distance

two great resultant truths nature never distinct never vacant 
changes like states vision corresponding take place objects nature two great principles truth deducible observation 
first place object close eye like always something see except hinted mysterious manner described 
see texture piece dress see individual threads compose though felt influence eye 
secondly place object far eye like becomes mere spot always something see though hinted manner described 
shadows lines local colors lost sight retires get mixed indistinguishable still difference always perceivable object possessing details flat vacant space 
grass blades meadow mile far discernible marked difference appearance piece wood painted green 
thus nature never distinct never vacant always mysterious always abundant always see something never see 
thus arise exquisite finish fulness god appointed perpetual source fresh pleasure cultivated observant eye finish distance render invisible nearness comprehensible every stone every bough every cloud every wave multiplied around us forever presented forever exhaustless
