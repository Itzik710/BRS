felt somewhat position hamlet doubting whether really surprised dark secret anxious circumstantial evidence told others suspicions 
strictly charged dona mention meeting miss norton little hamlet sandside dona readily promised 
imaginative present far interested rows cauliflowers specimens seaweeds problematical german spies 
marjorie several detective stories fresh memory determined go work craftily 
set little traps miss norton 
would casually ask questions germany prisoners war judge answers sympathies lay 
mistress however evidently guard replied terms caution 
one thing marjorie learned considered might suspicious circumstance 
miss norton received many letters abroad 
given foreign stamps rose butler seen tear envelopes marked opened censor

norty might get information send friends foreign countries would telegraph code neutral country berlin 
ascertained one prefects miss norton intended spend holidays isle wight
