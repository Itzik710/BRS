wheeling round greater haste ever continued headlong gallop disappeared side knoll 
dick naturally turned towards north see possible two riders flying 
kept long doubt band horsemen seen topping farthest ridge direction bearing belt woodland along edge galloped towards 
mistaking 
war whoop sounding faint shrill distance wild gesticulations riders told story seaman two pale faces pursued band bloodthirsty savages unskilled though backwoods warfare dick unfamiliar war alarms wanting common sense

pursuers red pursued white strengthened tendency fact one latter woman settled question 
instantly dick shook reins drove unarmed heels sides polly away went fugitives like black thunderbolt artillery nature wild yell told seen 
howl away ye land lubbers growled dick 
fill sails wi stiffer breeze howlin ye overhaul craft 
reached crest prairie billow whence could see fugitives still far ahead 
suddenly suspicion entered seaman mind made heart almost choke 
mary jackson father relative size countenanced idea woman seemed small man unusually large 
desperate haste dick urged gallant steed best pace well justify praises often bestowed hunky ben 
brief space time close behind fugitives dick convinced suspicions right

wheeling round dick cantered back knoll passed halted top 
position could see band fifty indians careering towards yelling satisfaction could also see solitary horseman clear cut bright sky 
dick got ready repeating rifle 
already mentioned fact learned load fire formidable weapon great rapidity though signally failed attempts aim 
well aware weakness made mind present desperate extremity aim always felt difficulty getting back front sights rifle correspond object aimed slow case impossible process 
therefore resolved simply point weapon fire surely muttered even trying moment surely altogether miss whole bunch fifty men horses waited thought savages within long range elevating piece little fired 
result justified hopes 
horse fell dead upon plain owner although evidently unwounded time hors de combat 
true plan dick kept quick continuous fire made much noise smoke seemed whole company riflemen work instead one man several horses plain testified success pointing compared aiming principle course fire partly returned time stout seaman pretty heavy rain bullets savages fired galloping aim necessarily bad 
fusillade naturally effect checking advance indians especially drew near reckless man snap rifle told last cartridge wheeled fled fast black polly could lay hoofs plain

waited till enemies close enough opened fire right left alternately indians found outwitted scarcely dared fire lest opposite bands hit 
expended second supply ammunition dick wheeled round took flight 
course mare soon carried range satisfaction observing fugitives increased distance foe
