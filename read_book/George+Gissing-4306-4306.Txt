patrician fidelity stood wife prudence 
one blot upon noble nature uttered basil sigh

soon two young men received permission withdraw left room physician entered 
obedient counsellor invalid gave several hours repose midway afternoon summoned daughter long agitating conversation 
besought aurelia cast heretical religion putting perils exposed abandonment true faith world next 
life hurrying end hour hour felt fever wasting little strength remained gone would protect enmities religion avarice would expose aurelia resistance sullen rather resolute countenance words suggested thinking would cost pride become penitent obstacle conscience

better accommodation awaited deacon leander whose arrival announced hour sunset trotting courier 
journey salernum wearied ecclesiastic could give hand kissed hostess straightway retire privacy repast ready served beside couch soon night fallen leander slumbered peacefully 
meanwhile basil decius friend rome supped together making cheer might circumstances surrentine wine little acrid falling short due age sufficed animate talk

vast change produced roman daily existence destruction aqueducts 
thermae henceforth unsupplied water magnificent resorts every class citizen lost attraction soon ceased frequented roman exercises amusements associated practice luxurious bathing without refreshment gymnasium tennis court lounge longer charmed 
rome became dependent upon wells tiber wretched resource compared never failing abundant streams poured every region city threw fountains every street 
belisarius soon goths retreated ordered repairing aqueduct served transtiberine district indispensable working janiculan mills corn ground departure neither enough energy sufficient sense security rome restoration even one greater conduits

formerly young roman basil rank occupied serious pursuit would spent several hours day one thermae still use inclined display would gone thither train domestic attendants probably parasites season hot found coolness cold warmed 
society never failed opportunity clandestine meetings could always found business pleasure day regulated reference immemorial habit

basil thought average roman changes could often amuse spectacles theaters circus offered grew something solitary habits supposed know intimately pass time religious meditation preface perhaps retirement world 
indolence bringing wonted temptations fell acquaintance heliodora neapolitan greek uncertain origin whose husband year held office city prefect 
acquaintance heliodora case sure dangerous thing might well prove fatal many fierce jealousies excited brilliant lady whose husband alone regarded equanimity amorous adventures 
happily basil take matter much heart scarce pretended cared whether heliodora day month already turned thoughts sweetness aemiliana young sister gordian chose might make wife 
sluggishness taken possession came promptings flesh months ago easily subdued lapse time made perilous 
ventured taunt forgetfulness veranilda would fiercely given lie reason veranilda image vivid day lost alone women power excite deepest tenderest emotions 
nevertheless late visited heliodora though visits appearance might paid lady acquaintance basil knew well whither tended 
yet heliodora affected total forgetfulness past talked veranilda confessed efforts make discovery regarding captive still fruitless though means gave hope therewithal treated basil half seriously good naturedly mocking smiles mere boy disdain mature womanhood 
thinking tossed couch library thought much since leaving heliodora yesterday afternoon

see ere long 
decius went forth morning exercise sometimes took form gentle game ball generally ramble foot unaccompanied never felt ease attendant followed 
habits solitary ever absorbed thought lost dreams avoided ways would likely encounter acquaintance strayed among ruins deserted gardens easily found remoter parts caelian 
day tempted delicious air bright ardent sunshine wandered unfrequented paths till sound voices broke upon meditation found view lateran

faces glowed health manifest simple contentment hitherto seen eyes children 
representatives every social rank majority belonged honorable families high intelligence marked many countenances one showed shadow anxious weary thought 
men said basil either never known burden life utterly cast live without care without passion 
suddenly flashed upon mind seemed sufficient explanation calm happiness 
entered woman 
woman existence forgotten alike young old forgotten lost earthly taint holy affection marcus spoken cherished abbot pious sister scholastica 
clearly saw supreme triumph religious life 
instead quieting thought disturbed 
went away thinking thoughts would fain kept distance 
ninth hour found oratory later attended vespers office monks sang evening hymn holy ambrosius lux beata trinitas et principalis uuitas jam sol recedit igneus infunde lumen cordibus 
te mane laudum carmine te deprecemur vesperi te nostra supplex gloria per cuncta laudet saecula 
long sweet notes lingered basil mind lay rest 
crossed sleeping prayer breathed infunde lumen cordi meo

deodatus looked master eyes pathetic earnestness tried vain speak burst tears

could approve wisdom renounced flesh rewarded tranquillity earth eternal happiness hereafter ally intellect 
moreover certain asked embraced religious life rewarded turning pages augustine work come upon passage arrested eye perturbed thought passage seemed clearly intimate soul eternal destiny beginning things decided god men created bliss damnation 
basil dwell profoundly doubt nature inclined theological scrutiny spiritual brooding helped revive energies sickness abated throw back simple faith christianity everyday grown 
going forth mellow sunshine turned steps garden vegetables saw monks work 
gave gentle greeting one brought volume yesterday announced abbot invited basil visit office third hour 
thereupon worked silence watching 
time came conducted abbot dwelling tower beside ancient gateway arx 
contained two rooms one founder monastery studied transacted business upper chamber prayed slept 
reply knock study door voice familiar less impressive bade come forward basil felt heart beat quickly stood alone venerable presence new born self confidence fell away 
beholding aged man seated table lay books amid perfect stillness light large window golden cross either side bowl sweet scented flowers seemed remember benedict whose fame gone forth many lands whose holiness already numbered blessed saints rather mortal men recounted things miraculous 
looking upon face time touched enhance calm make yet purer sweet humanity felt idle wanton child entrance hither profanation 
come sit son basil said abbot 
leisure shall glad hear speak many things 
tell first love reading basil answered simple truth late years scarce read inclination rather active life 
surmised 
chancing look upper window long sunrise saw walking book hand

paradise deemed desirable watered delightful flow four rivers much blessed mind refreshed founts one hundred fifty psalms basil scarce heeded sense passage read 
could hear soft music aged voice lulled calm full faith trust 
better asked benedict gently whilst eyes searched young man countenance live service kings utter worldly counsel better far doubt basil replied humility 
utter rest thought said abbot smiling 
doubt yet utter mind dear son 
father obey desiring indeed soul seek guidance

voice faltered head drooped

holy father hypocrite spoke country first 
year gone another love possessed 
forgive dare speak word 
abbot turned eyes window 
upon sill settled two doves seemed regard curiously 
made soft gesture hand birds flew away 
speak said brief reflection indulgence 
tells speaks man god 
basil told told humble simplicity entire truthfulness recounting history day first beheld veranilda dreadful hour marcian blood stained hands 
began calm revival emotions slept sickness convalescence soon troubled profoundly 
dormant feelings wake things forgotten rushed memory 
came last interview veranilda remembered first time since day said recollection dismayed 
burst tears overwhelmed misery shame 
may sobbed innocent 
suffering driven mad uttered words never passed lips 
guiltless lives baser man reproached father scorn cast reproach father treachery 
abbot brow rested upon hand 
thus listened unmoving throughout story stir basil ceased alike speaking tears sat little stillness reflection 
length turned eyes upon young man spoke sad gravity 
even even 
gave heart woman worshipped feet behold come upon guilt blood 
would protest fault friend false wrath slew 
made basil judge executioner father seek excuse sin 
well 
penance lay upon utterly subdued awe oblivious presence one much powerful basil murmured whatever penance man god saw fit impose would perform 
nay said benedict gently like presumption 
say rather would endeavor perform 
believe bade fast long repeat many prayers would punctually obey 
demanded flesh motive life rebelled much yet dare promise achieve basil looked fearfully answered tremulous lips strength perchance help god 
grave smile passed benedict countenance 
well son well 
come let us reason sin 
avow god commands ever little mind whereas thought much world governance 
might ask possible reflect weal woe human kind without taking count made world rules let approach narrower inquiry 
tell love country desire peace 
comes numbered violent lawless renounce citizenship dishonor state could worldly meditations preserve gross incoherence thought action indeed done 
would perchance spleen overcome reason 
case basil every man day calls roman citizen 
therefore italy lies wrath high 
therefore rome fallen breath pestilence sword destroyer yea earthquake flood famine desolate land 
yet find little time son meditate laws god busied welfare men 
methinks story aimed little wide 
basil bent low gentle irony softened heart 
abbot mused moment gazing upon golden cross 
days old continued romans knew subdue desires good country 
self seeking wronged state cast forth bosom 
therefore rome grew mighty omnipotent fostering ends fulness time disclose 
virtue ancestors even though worshipped darkly altars daemons 
pride fell hearts hardened length heathendom wellnigh destroyed principle whereby waxed god revealed unto chosen ancient virtue new faith might restore world 
turn thought upon things sent book written long ago holy father augustine concerning divine state

therein discover largely expounded reasonings touch upon 
would trace god working past musing upon ripen citizenship whereon prided though neither understood true meaning strength perform duties 
losing sight heavenly city earth even earthly service worthy name roman inasmuch wronged earthly rome even sin eternal state supreme lord whereof baptism made citizen 
basil anger god prolonged lest think amid long bloody war amid trampling armies fall cities one death account say eyes seeing deed may heavier moment slaughter battlefield 
lips manifest even sound assurance guilt professed punish 
may man wronged supposed 
little patience little calm becomes reasoning soul might saved crime resolved must ever doubt harassed thoughts

frenzy thought lamentation death lover 
call frenzy remember son less frenzy every act life every thought led path ultimate sin 
frenzy live flesh frenzy imagine good come aught purpose without beseeching divine guidance 
much else abbot utter vein holy admonition 
basil would listened acquiescence perfect faith stirred within memory read augustine pages darkening spirit 
length found courage speak asked trembling tones one born sin condemnation unhappy beings strive vain doom predetermined almighty benedict countenance fell admission dread possibility rather painful surprise 
ask answered solemnly pause man ask even communes soul stillness night 
gospel preached nowhere word god forbidden hear hearing accept solace 
think upon dark mystery even understandings god enlightened shows formless dread 
sinner shall brood upon sin save abhor 
shall repents darken repentance questioning god mercy indeed thing turning wrong righteousness 
sent book resumed observing relief came basil face mind salutary teaching live much man world especially priding upon name roman little given reflection upon evil rome wrought 
known lay upon conscience withheld everything holy writ

several times late come gaze across mountainous landscape wondering veranilda might 
turning companion laid hand man shoulder addressed voice much gentleness 
leave nothing behind deodatus would make thought never returning home sorrow nothing dear lord reply 
lifetime seen much grief little solace

continuing question basil learned man life world weariness dread 
hardships many kinds oppressed childhood meek soul place amid rudeness violence times first hour cloistered life cast spell upon 
peace repeated

basil mused understanding approving yet unable utter words 
eyes strayed towards far valley shimmering earliest daylight 
suffered dread things whilst living world could expect life future would kindly none less heart yearn valley human tribulation 
struggled subdue 
deodatus pray may strength see best 
forced humility 
beautiful basil eyes showed piety calm surrounded reverence founder house peace fell little short regarded saints heaven 
never unless certain moments conversing lady silvia felt loveliness life religion supreme never assuredly stirred within spirit devout 
longed attain unto righteousness entire purity seemed could enjoyed monastic seclusion 
life heard praise renounced world merit far uncomprehended thing without relation

man sinner behoved else chasten soul might pleasing unto god behold way one sinned grievously might well path salvation 
morning went forth monks labor 
brother marcus conducted plot garden ground light work done left 
willingly basil set task broke monotony day agreeable 
always found pleasure rustic life late asculan villa often wished could abide quiet rest days amid fields vineyards 
working mellow sunlight soft blue sky early autumn around silence mountain forest felt health renew 
first drops sweat stood upon forehead wiped away earthy fingers mere action knew gave pleasure 
sudden became aware lost something 
little finger left hand slipped signet ring 
must fallen since began working anxiously searched ground 
whilst thus occupied marcus came towards carrying great basket vegetables 
without diffidence basil told happened 
rebuke holy brother heeding loss
