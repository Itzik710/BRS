left went another room dining room heard jingling glasses drinking healths sat fire foot fender marriage lines hand 
brain still numbed 
felt one might feel drowned sea descending without quite losing consciousness depths abyss 
remember thought gone differed respect signing marriage settlement except one case given husband rights money father money whereas case seemed given rights 
otherwise cold drear dead unaffecting 
blue paper slipped hand worn hearthrug helpless meditations interrupted thrumming throbbing motor car outside father office door saying loud commanding voice come gel guess time back 
half hour afterwards room home given dressmakers 
still moved automatically creature without strength 
thirty first chapter indefinite memory floating vaguely sights sounds next two hours everybody except wildly excited cousins railing repeatedly unseen regions house aunt bridget scolding indiscriminately dressmakers chattering without ceasing fitted wedding dress standing intervals cries delight success efforts wind roaring chimney church bells ringing distance ever increasing moaning sea st mary rock finally rumbling rubber wheels several carriages plash horses hoofs gravel drive 
dressmakers done wearing ivory satin dress embroidered silver coronal myrtle orange blossoms old limerick lace family veil well string pearls one big diamond noble house marrying 
remember said black hair shone blue lustre sparkling gem dare say looked gay outside anyway 
last heard fluttering silk outside room running stream chatter going stairs followed banging carriage doors father deep voice saying bride ready good time go guess 
alone made effort dress still wearing every day serge usual heavy boots 
even flower button hole 
speak much way church found certain comfort big warm presence sat together carriage windows shut rising storm beginning frighten 
nothing said father 
puff wind slant rain maybe 
little church thronged people 
even galleries full children village school 
twittering overhead like young birds tree walked nave father arm could help hear sound organ whispered words people pews either side us 
dear heart alive straight like mother bless goodness yes poor misfortunate mother come life 
deed daughter luck though 
lord raa waiting communion rail 
looked yet nervous morning though trying bear usual composure thought certain expression fear face never seen 
friend witness mr eastcliff wearing carnation button hole side aunt lady margaret carrying sheaf beautiful white flowers standing near 
witnesses bridesmaids betsy beauty nessy macleod large hats soaring black feathers behind 
could hear rustle rose colored skirts indistinct buzz whispered conversation well audible reproofs aunt bridget crinkly black silk dress bonnet like half moon telling silent look placid 
next moment conscious bell rung chancel organ stopped coughing hemming church ceased somebody saying stand lord lord raa nervous laugh asking taking place side lighted altar laden flowers front bishop vestments father dan surplice white stole clerk carrying book vessel holy water beginning service 
surely never sadder ceremony 
never girl similar circumstances feel vivid presentiment pains penalties follow forced ill assorted marriage 
yet came course service startling change thought wiped sadness made forget compulsion put upon lifted realm spiritual ecstasy 
bishop began short litany asked god blessing ceremony join together two children bonds holy wedlock 
going conscious nothing except howling wind church windows far tolling bell st mary rock nothing voice within seemed say love love hardly actual ceremony commenced began overawed solemnity divine power service sense god leaning littleness guiding according 
matter unworthy preparations led marriage god making god makes marriages blessed church therefore overrules good ends human impulses however sordid selfish may 
thought came nothing else seemed matter nothing however jarring incongruous able lower exaltation spirit 
service effect upon appeared exactly opposite effect lord raa 
nervousness increased visibly though best conceal lightness manner sometimes looked like derision 
thus bishop stepped us said james charles munster wilt thou take mary present thy lawful wife according rite holy mother church husband halted stammered answer saying beneath breath thought heretic 
corresponding question put father dan thinking must nervous leaned whispered worry child take time replied loud clear unfaltering voice 
husband put ring gold silver salver fumbled dropped fumbled dropped second time take blessed laughing audibly awkwardness repeat bishop ring thee wed gold silver thee give body thee worship worldly goods thee endow tendered ring slowly obvious effort 
took without trembling thinking spite heard ways life solemn sacred sacrament made mine one else mysterious account know everything considered perhaps strangest fact life 
remember ceremony father dan spoke softly caressingly child felt need comforting strength higher source 
also remember afterwards said ceremony eyes newly wedded couple seemed sedulously shun look husband marriage like prayer carrying back sense purity sanctity little sunlit church rome mildred bankes taken vows 
marriage service nuptial mass benediction special dispensation rome raised still higher pitch spiritual exaltation sustained 
father dan read epistle beginning let wives subject husbands bishop read gospel concluding therefore two one flesh therefore god hath joined together let man put asunder 
trembled thought solemn sonorous words solitude room spoken congregation fear misgiving nothing sense rapture consecration 
last words spoken lord raa man wife stepped sacristy sign register even spirit fail 
took pen signed name without tremor 
hardly done heard rumbling murmur voices first bishop voice worldly tone father husband voices many others light conversation mingled trills laughter 
moment twinkling fast snowflake melts upon stream spell marriage service seemed break 
heard since eyes wet moment seemed crying ceremony 
know nothing know felt kind internal shudder soul suddenly awakened intoxicating drug 
organ began play wedding march husband putting arm said come 
much audible whispering among people waiting us church walked towards door saw ghostly faces smiling every side heard ghostly voices speaking whispers like backward plash wavelets shore 
sakes alive white looking though said somebody somebody else said could help hear dear heart knows father done right
