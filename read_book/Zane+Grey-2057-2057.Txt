little different shape color size vary according environment 
panther rockies usually light taking grayish hue rocks 
stockier heavier build stronger limb eastern species difference comes climbing mountains springing cliffs prey 
regions accessible man man encountered even rarely cougar exceedingly shy seldom never venturing cover day 
spends hours daylight high rugged cliffs sleeping basking sunshine watching wonderfully keen sight valleys 
hearing equals sight danger threatens always hears time skulk away unseen 
night steals mountain side toward deer elk located day 
keeping lowest ravines thickets creeps upon prey 
cunning ferocity keener savage proportion length time without food 
grows hungrier thinner skill fierce strategy correspondingly increase 
well fed cougar creep upon secure one seven deer elk antelope mountain sheep stalks 
starving cougar another animal 
creeps like snake sure scent vulture makes noise shadow hides behind stone bush would scarcely conceal rabbit 
springs terrific force intensity purpose seldom fails reach victim claws starved lion touch flesh never let go 
cougar seldom pursues quarry leaped missed either disgust failure knowledge second attempt would futile 
animal making easiest prey cougar elk 
every elk attacked falls victim 
deer fortunate ratio one dead five leaped 
antelope living lowlands upland meadows escapes nine times ten mountain sheep bighorn seldom falls onslaught enemy 
lion gets hold great forepaw every movement struggling prey sinks sharp hooked claws deeper 
quickly possible lion fastens teeth throat prey grips till dead 
way elk carried lions many rods 
lion seldom tears skin neck never generally supposed sucks blood victim cuts side behind foreshoulder eats liver first 
rolls skin back neatly tightly person could 
gorged drags carcass ravine dense thicket rakes leaves sticks dirt hide animals 
usually returns cache second night frequency visits depends supply fresh prey 
remote regions unfrequented man lion guard cache coyote buzzards

caused jealous vicious disposition male 
fact old toms kill every young lion catch 
male female litter suffer alike weaning time males 
matter wise animal logic displayed toms 
domestic cat extent possesses trait 
litter destroyed mating time sure come regardless season 
thus savage trait lions prevents overproduction breeds hardy intrepid race 
chance cardinal feature animal life survival fittest young male lion escapes weaning time even persecuted 
young male lions killed found flesh beaten mass bruises undoubtedly work old tom 
moreover old males females killed found bruised condition 
feature conclusive one fact invariably female suckling young period sustains bruises desperately defending litter 
astonishing cunning wise faithful old lioness 
seldom leaves kittens 
time six weeks old takes train battles life struggle continues birth death 
lion hardly ever dies naturally 
soon night descends lioness stealthily stalks forth little ones takes short steps 
cubs follow stepping mother tracks 
crouches game little lion crouches also one remains perfectly still springs signals come 
secures prey gorge 
feast mother takes back trail stepping tracks made coming mountain 
cubs careful follow suit leave marks trail soft snow

old toms white hunters foes

snow hound trail three four days track made 
jones game warden yellowstone national park unexampled opportunities hunt cougars learn habits 
cougars region rockies made rendezvous game preserve 
jones soon procured pack hounds trained run deer foxes coyotes great trouble 
would break trail animals also elk antelope farthest wish 
soon realized train hounds sore task 
refused come back call stung fine shot manner taught obedience 
obedience enough hounds must know follow tree lion 
mind jones decided catch lion alive give dogs practical lessons 
days reaching decision discovered tracks two lions neighborhood mt everett 
hounds put trail followed abandoned coal shaft 
jones recognized opportunity taking lasso extra rope crawled hole 
fifteen feet opening sat one cougars snarling spitting 
jones promptly lassoed passed end lasso round side prop shaft soldiers followed 
instructing pull till called cautiously began crawl cougar intention getting farther back roping hind leg prevent disaster soldiers pulled 
accomplished without uneasiness regard second lion giving word companions soon captive hauled shaft tied tightly could move 
jones took cougar hounds open place park trees prepared chase 
loosing lion held hounds back moment let go 
within one hundred yards cougar climbed tree dogs saw performance 
taking forked stick jones mounted cougar caught jaw stick pushed 
fight scramble cougar dashed run another tree 
manner soon trained hounds pink perfection 
jones discovered park cougar king beasts north america 
even grizzly dashed away great haste cougar made appearance 
road camp near mt washburn fall bears grizzlies others always hanging round cook tent 
cougars also almost every evening dusk big fellow would come parading past tent 
bears would grunt furiously scamper every direction 
easy tell cougar neighborhood peculiar grunts snorts bears sharp distinct alarmed yelps coyotes 
lion would lief kill coyote animal would devour 
fighting cougars grizzlies mooted question credit side former 
story doings cougars told snow intensely fascinating tragic stalked deer elk crept within springing distance crouched flat leap easy read told print 
leaps bounds beyond belief 
longest leap level measured eighteen one half feet 
jones trailed half grown cougar turn trailing big elk 
found cougar struck game clung many rods dashed low limb spruce tree 
imprint body cougar foot deep snow blood tufts hair covered place 
sign cougar renewing chase 
rare cases cougars would refuse run take trees 
one day jones followed hounds eight number come huge tom holding whole pack bay 
walked fro lashing tail side side jones dashed coolly climbed tree 
jones shot cougar falling struck one hounds crippling 
hound would never approach tree incident believing probably cougar sprung upon 
usually hounds chased quarry tree long jones rode 
always desirable kill animal first shot 
cougar wounded fell jumped among dogs sure terrible fight best dogs always received serious injuries killed outright 
lion would seize hound pull close bite brain 
jones asserted cougar would usually run hunter feature relied upon 
wounded cougar dangerous tiger 
hunts jones carried shotgun shells loaded ball cougar others loaded fine shot hounds 
one day ten miles camp hounds took trail ran rapidly inches snow 
jones found large lion taken refuge tree fallen another aiming shoulder beast fired barrels 
cougar made sign hit 
jones reloaded fired head 
old fellow growled fiercely turned tree walked head first something would able tree upright 
hounds ready wisely attacked rear 
realizing shooting fine shot animal jones began hurried search shell loaded ball 
lion made compelling dodge behind trees 
even though hounds kept nipping cougar persistent fellow still pursued hunter 
last jones found right shell cougar reached 
major leader hounds darted bravely grasped leg beast nick time 
enabled jones take aim fire close range ended fight 
upon examination discovered cougar half blinded fine shot accounted ineffectual attempts made catch jones 
mountain lion rarely attacks human purpose eating 
hungry often follow tracks people favorable circumstances may ambush 
park game plentiful one ever known cougar follow trail person outside park lions known follow hunters particularly stalk little children 
davis family living miles north park children pursued doors cabin 
families relate similar experiences 
jones heard one fatality believes children left alone woods cougars would creep closer closer assured danger would spring kill 
jones never heard cry cougar national park strange circumstance considering great number animals believed account abundance game 
heard boy illinois man west cry always weird wild like scream terrified woman 
understand significance cry unless meant hunger wailing mourn lioness murdered cubs 
destructiveness savage species murderous 
jones came upon one old tom den pile nineteen elk mostly yearlings 
five six eaten 
jones hunted old fellow months found lion killed average three animals week 
hounds got length chased yellowstone river swam point impassable man horse 
one dogs giant bloodhound named jack swam swift channel kept lion never returned 
cougars peculiar traits habits creatures old toms strongly marked characteristics one destructive cougar jones ever knew
