found becket household already knew arrest 
woven dirge subject land last town doings adventures golf courses formed genial topic dinner table bulgarian carbohydrates already wonder past 
bigwigs week end quite different lot three weeks ago comparatively homogeneous three different plans settling land question none fortunately involved real disturbance existing state things potato brown bread plan based belief held respectable press constructive portions community omelette made without breaking eggs 
one thing alone whole house party agreed importance question 
indeed sincere conviction point like card one produces one admitted certain functions 
one came becket without begged borrowed stole moment smelled clara special pot pourri hall though sometimes threw railway carriage window returning town nothing remarkable 
conversational debauch first night dinner alas two even becket week end undoubtedly revealed feeling set late nothing really wrong condition agricultural laborer trouble unreasonable fellow stay land 
believed henry wiltram conjunction colonel martlett point promoting policy imposing penalties attempted leave without good reason reason left discretion impartial district boards composed one laborer one farmer one landowner decision going favor majority 
though opinion rather freely expressed since voting would always two one might trench liberty subject many thought interests country much consideration something sort would found best arrangement 
cruder early notions resettling land fostering peasant proprietorship habitable houses security tenure already cloud since suspected would interfere unduly game laws soundly vested interests 
mere penalization whose fathers great pains planted much covert enclosed much common laid much country grass hardly policy statesmen 
section guests perhaps strongest silent distinctly favored new departure henry wiltram coupled swinging corn tax indubitably stout platform 
second section guests spoke openly favor lord settleham policy good 
whole thing thought must voluntary see reason left kindness good intentions landowner land question 
boards would formed every county model landowners sir gerald malloring lord settleham would sit apply principles goodwill 
policy criticism levelled felix 
could agreed said noticed lord settleham nearly landowners thoroughly satisfied existing good averse changes education might foster increase 
asked landowners full good satisfied could improved matter already done proposed settled land question believed land question like capable settlement improvement spirit concerned found little difficult credit lord settleham rest landowners sincerity matter long unconscious need improvement

felix freely admitted hastened explain question er parliamentary sincerity lord settleham followers 
ventured doubt whether realized hold human nature 
experience said houses bred seminaries trained convinced still conspiracy foot blind lord settleham others concerning since part conspiracy little danger unmasking 
juncture felix felt exceeded limit fair criticism toleration toward literary men certain reputation country houses persons brought say clever irresponsible things prevented people taking seriously 
third section guests unquestionably static others confined pointing though land question undoubtedly serious nothing whatever would result placing impositions upon landowners 
land simply capital invested certain way poorly 
capital simply means causing wages paid 
whether paid men looked birds dogs loaded guns beat coverts drove shoot paid men ploughed fertilized land matter dictate man pay wages last degree un english 
everybody knew fate come coming upon capital 
driven country leaps bounds though sure still perversely persisted yielding every year larger revenue way income tax 
would dastardly take advantage land sort capital could fly country times need
