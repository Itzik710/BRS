chapter glen find dull walking upon hartford bridge flat sad november day well deny moor looks somewhat dreary though dull need never 
though fog clinging fir trees creeping among heather till see far minley corner hardly far bramshill woods berkshire hills invisible dark midnight yet plenty seen feet 
though nothing left pick flowers dead brown except poor half withered scrap bottle heath nothing left catch either butterflies insects dead except one poor old daddy long legs sits upon piece turf boring hole tail lay eggs frost catches ends like rest though things say seem dead yet plenty life around feet may almost say stones tread 
though place dreary enough sheet flat heather little glen banks dead fern brown bog fir trees struggling yet eyes see little bit glen beautiful wonderful beautiful wonderful cunningly devised took thousands years make believe half finished yet 
know fairy told fairy lives upon moor indeed places else people eyes see 
name tell 
best name give think must something like real name always answer call patiently reverently madam 
come good time called even little child 
let us see work teach us copy 
another fairy likewise hardly hope see 
thankful lifted even smallest corner veil showed us moment finger tip beautiful yet awful 
sight believe would make us proud great privilege 
dear child would make us feel smaller meaner stupid ignorant ever felt lives time would make us wiser ever lives one glimpse great glory call lady 
say presently 
must talk first madam perhaps may help us hereafter see lady 
servant lady mistress though master whose name leave guess 
heard often already hear ever ever 
one thing must warn must confound madam lady 
many people fall great mistakes thereby mistakes even little child would think need commit 
really great philosophers sometimes make mistake therefore wonder people make write children books wonders nature call reason 
books good books read study tell really 
tell reason things happen way happen 
however must blame good folks made mistake often may shame 
see know perfectly difference talking 
ask go day would answer opened door 
answer go answer go chose take walk 
talk things beside must remember difference 
ask fire burn would answer suppose little boy hot know 
great chemist instead little boy would apt answer afraid fire burns vibratory motion molecules heated substance communicates molecules skin destroys tissue dare say quite true tells us fire burns way means burns tell us reason burns 
ask reason fire burns dear child know 
lady business mistress mrs think things ever saw see even dream 
reason making fire burn may tell 
believe excellent grounds reason good one 
dare guess say one reason least fire burns may take care play scorch finger set whole bed fire perhaps house bargain might tempted putting finger fire pleasant putting sugar mouth 
dear child could get clearly head difference remember steadily life done good given thousand pounds 
know two different matters must confounded let us look madam see work making little glen told half made yet 
one thing shall see see clearly older grow mean wonderful patience diligence 
madam never idle instant 
nothing great small keeps work eye moment makes every separate bit help every bit 
keep sun stars order looks poor old mrs daddy long legs eggs 
spend thousands years building mountain thousands years grinding carefully polish every grain sand falls mountain put right place wanted thousands years hence take much trouble one grain sand whole mountain 
settle exact place mrs daddy long legs shall lay eggs time settling shall happen hundreds years hence stair millions miles away 
really believe madam knows work thoroughly grain sand sticks shoe weight mrs daddy long legs eggs bottom hole effect upon suns stars ages dead gone 
patient indeed madam 
mind least seeing work destroyed knows must destroyed 
spell upon fate everything makes must unmake yet good wise woman never frets tires fudges work say school 
takes much pains make acorn make peach 
takes much pains acorn pig eats acorn grow tall oak help build great ship 
took much pains acorn crushed foot fancy never come anything 
madam wiser 
knows come something 
find use finds use everything 
acorn crushed turn mould mould go feed roots plant perhaps next year lies perhaps washed brook river go sea feed roots plant new continent ages ages hence madam 
dropped stick river yesterday floated away 
sorry cost great deal trouble cut peel carve head name 
madam sorry though taken great deal trouble stick ever taken 
three years making stick many things sunbeams among rest 
fell river madam knew lose sunbeams anything else stick would float river sea got heavy salt water would sink lodge buried perhaps ages hence turn coal ages one would dig burn would come bright warm flame sunbeams stored away stick madam would 
fate stick still something else happen useful long run madam never loses anything uses scraps odds ends somehow somewhere somewhen fit proper housekeeper whole universe 
indeed madam patient people fancy stupid think fall passion every time steal sweets break crockery disarrange furniture therefore care 
advise little boy still grow man get fancy head find however good natured patient madam matters keeping silence seeming see sign forgotten 
contrary bears grudge one may say respect longer one else always 
indeed sometimes think lady mistress might bear grudges ever ever 
seen men ere damage madam property little boys punished lives long even though mended broken pieces turned use 
therefore say beware madam 
teach kindly patiently tenderly mother want learn trade 
instead learning trade damage materials play tools beware lest 
people think madam stupid ill tempered cruel makes earthquakes storms famine pestilences sort blind passion caring go hurt quite heedless way wants anything go anywhere 
madam terrible doubt doubt also people choose learn teach get way whenever business dangerous 
cruel unjust may believe like 
dear boys girls need believe trust lady sure mistress servant ever 
lady utterly good kind know full well believe case old proverb holds like mistress like servant know madam shall content ready submit whatever stupid resignation folks preach believe lady resignation 
merely saying cured must endured like donkey turns tail hail storm true resignation resignation fit grown people children alike resignation beginning end wisdom religion believe lady knows best perfectly good mistress madam master whose name say leave guess 
taught afraid madam go watch work understand anything see ask questions 
always show us one lesson books give time 
wait time answer need fear catching cold though november keeps lesson books scattered strange places may walk hill make makes glen 
well glen made shall guess like guess 
think perhaps earthquake opened dear child must look guess 
looked little got grounds guessing may guess 
ground supposing ever earthquake strong enough open glen 
may one must guess know 
guess 
perhaps always beginning world dear child proof either 
everything round changing shape daily hourly find longer live therefore reasonable suppose glen changed shape everything else earth done 
besides told madam made glen making yet half finished 
first guess next guess water making glen water nothing else 
open young eyes 
blame 
looked glen fifteen years made guess looked ten years since make sure guess held good 
man blind dear boy stupid see lies feet day long lady lady obeys patient gentle mankind would perished face earth long ago simply stupidity 
least stupid case head full earthquakes convulsions nature sorts prodigies never happened glen trying find course found nothing 
put head began look found lo behold seen thousand times yet never learned anything like stupid man though learned may learn easily 
find pond bottom glen 
know pond course need go well 
know also pond always filling sand mud though clean every three four years always fills sand mud come stream course runs bog 
see coming every time flood stream fouls 
well 
said madam soon recollected see stupid man stream made glen earth runs stream part hill stand 
confess much ashamed said 
history whole mystery 
madam digging away soft spade water 
harder spade rather plough strongest terrible ploughs glad say laid england 
water water simple thing dug great glen 
dear child wonderful part madam work great things many different things one tool looks simple though really 
water instance simple thing complicated might spend hours talking water without come end wonders 
still madam great economist never wastes materials 
like sailor boasted never boasts long life strong knife would build st paul cathedral done 
madam long life plenty time one strongest tools water 
stoop look heather show digging glen mist hanging feet 
least guess 
see mist clings points heather leaves makes drops 
hot sun came drops would dry would vanish air light warm steam 
dark cold drip run heather stems ground 
whither go whither water go hundreds gallons perhaps dripped run heather single day sink ground know 
become madam use underground spade uses rain least rains hard therefore rain runs moor instead sinking spade ground 
come edge glen show mist fell yesterday perhaps coming ground hard work 
know odd indeed pretty form glens 
flat moor ends suddenly steep rounded bank almost like crest wave ready like wave crest fall know falling sometimes bit bit soil bare 
oh yes fond banks 
awfully jolly say scrambling deep heath fern besides plenty rabbit holes sand rabbit holes flat gravel 
yes know know must go far banks much less roll almost certain bog bottom lying upon gentle slope get wet 
round hills aldershot one direction windsor another see shaped glens wave crest along top foot crest line springs run slopes well deep sand galls call shaking quagmires sometimes deep enough swallow horse love dance upon summer time 
water springs nothing rain mist dew sunk first peaty soil gravel sand stopped 
gravel tell strange story one day sand geologists call upper bagshot sand entirely different set beds geologists call bracklesham beds place near new forest beds vein clay clay water get seen dug field puddle pond head good fun thought pretty mess made 
well water get though clay must go somewhere runs continually along top clay runs undermines bank brings sand gravel continually next shower wash stream 
think one moment wonderful shape glens fond settled particular order madam laid gravel sand mud bottom sea ages ages ago 
told least thing madam day may take effect hundreds thousands years hence 
must tell think time glen different shape dare say according notions much prettier shape 
like one chines used see bournemouth 
recollect narrow gap cliff striped sands gravels mouth gap feet across poured great slope mud sand shape half bun wet dry used scramble get chine call chine truest sense fairyland 
recollect eaten mountain ranges pinnacles steep cliffs white yellow pink standing clear blue sky till agreed putting aside difference size beautiful grand alps ever seen pictures 
saw could mistake chine hollowed springs broke high cliff rain wore sand furrowed pinnacles peaks 
recollect beautiful place looked back saw miniature mountain walls bright blue sea heard murmur sands outside 
verily believe might done stood somewhere bottom glen thousands years ago 
seen sea front us rather arm sea finchampstead ridges opposite instead covered farms woodlands purple heath would steep cliffs sand clay like see bournemouth would spoilt somewhat beauty sight along shores would floated least winter great blocks floes ice might seen tideway king lynn winter last growling crashing grubbing ploughing sand gravel mud sweeping away seas towards north fruitful land 
may seem like dream yet true day another talk madam show even child like true 
could change beautiful chine like bournemouth wide sloping glen like bracknell bottom wood like coombs many acres large middle well think 
capital plan finding madam secrets see might one place explain done another 
suppose madam orders lift whole coast bournemouth twenty even ten feet higher sea 
could easily enough coast south america ages summer hasty people would call hasty violent ruthless way though shall say believe lady knows best 
steadily west coast norway rising quietly vast range mountain wall iron bound cliff rate four feet hundred years without making least noise confusion even causing extra ripple sea light gentle madam strong finger 
mouth chine bournemouth lifted twenty feet sea one thing would happen high tide would come longer wash away cake dirt entrance saw often 
mud stopped mud behind would come slowly lodge inside till chine half filled upper part cliffs continue eaten away level springs ran 
gradually chine instead deep narrow would become broad shallow instead hollowing rapidly every shower rain saw chine bournemouth would hollow slowly glen 
one thing would happen sea ceased gnaw foot cliffs outside carry away every stone grain sand fell cliffs would soon cease cliffs rain frost would still crumble dirt fell would lie feet gradually make slope dry land far shallow sea tops instead steep would become smooth rounded last instead two sharp walls cliff chine mouth might mouth glen mount warren hill long slopes sheets drifted gravel sand feet stretching icy sea vale blackwater 
really believe madam done simply lifting hartford bridge flat feet sea leaving rest trusty tool water sky 
guess think good guess asked madam hundred different questions last ten years always answered way saying water water stupid man 
want merely depend say 
want understand madam must ask questions make mind like man instead taking things hearsay second hand like vulgar 
mind vulgar mean poor people mean ignorant uneducated people use brains rightly though may fine ladies kings popes 
bible says prove things hold fast good 
prove guess proves good hold fast 
first direct experiment called 
plain english go home make little hartford bridge flat stable yard ask mrs make glen like glen 
go home try 
make great flat cake clay put upon cap sand rain upon watering pot see mrs begin soon make glen side heap like hartford bridge flat 
believe certainly fresh proof guess right 
see whether water make glens different shape run soils different kind 
make hartford bridge flat turned upside cake sand cap clay top rain watering pot see sort glens make 
guess like seen steep overhanging cliffs narrow gullies shall try make mind whether think right wrong 
meanwhile remember gullies made water 
another way verifying theory called plain english seeing guess holds good look valleys merely valleys round valleys clay chalk limestone hard slate rock saw devonshire see whether guess hold good whether deep shallow broad narrow rock earth may hollowed running water 
sure would would find something amuse something instruct whenever wish 
know 
longest railroad journey instead stupid like continually turning leaves wonderful book looking wonderful pictures old worlds made unmade thousands years ago 
keep looking railway cuttings bones old worlds laid bare surface ground plains downs banks knolls hills mountains continually asking mrs gave shape soon teach 
tell fairly answer almost every case running water 
either water running soft usually water running hard plain words moving ice 
moving ice mrs stronger spade tell time show marks every gravel pit 
see want ask question mean say water made great valleys seen paintings photographs valleys thousands feet deep among mountains thousands feet high yes 
said like take word upon trust 
older shall go mountains shall judge 
still must say never saw valley however deep cliff however high scooped water even mountain tops stand miles aloft jagged peaks pinnacles sky cut first cut sharpened still little else save water soft hard rain frost ice 
water nothing else sawn chasm ships run bristol leigh wood st vincent rocks 
water nothing else shaped peaks matterhorn weisshorn pic du midi pyrenees seen sketches photographs 
water might saw hartford bridge flat time enough labyrinth valleys hills peaks standing alone done already ambarrow edgbarrow folly hill side vale 
see astonished notion water make alps 
knew would astonished madam great thing simple tool began showing thing small way upon flats 
safest way learn madam methods watch work little corners commonplace business astonish frighten us put huge hasty guesses dreams heads 
sir isaac newton tell found great law gravitation holds true suns stars heaven watching apple fall even find found know careful thinking plain commonplace fact things weight 
humble patient watch madam work little things 
way see work upon space time 
question ask oh talked madam lifting hartford bridge flat 
could dear child long story must tell time 
meanwhile ever see lid kettle rise shake water inside boiled course course remember madam must done 
think next talk possibly lifting hartford bridge flat 
longing perhaps time hear lady set madam make bracknell bottom 
dear child answer dare give whatever purposes may made made least come day look talk become thereby wiser earnest hope humble better people 
whatever else lady may wish wish wishes always make men wise men good 
written parable called lady lord possessed beginning way works old 
set everlasting beginning ever earth 
depths brought forth fountains abounding water 
mountains settled hills brought forth yet made earth fields highest part dust world 
prepared heavens set compass upon face depth established clouds strengthened fountains deep gave sea decree waters pass commandment appointed foundations earth one brought daily delight rejoicing always rejoicing habitable part earth delights sons men 
therefore hearken unto ye children blessed keep ways 
say said us already 
beyond say need say little 
read book job god laid foundations earth 
see says st paul glass darkly know part 
asks known mind lord hath counsellor things glory ever ever 
amen 
therefore must rashly say thing happened invent called final causes lady little notions lady done rather done place 
indeed thinking shall find anything lady 
speaks eyes brains like madam inner part us call hearts spirits endure eyes brain turned dust 
heart pure sober gentle truthful lady speaks without words tells things madam pupils men science never tell 
lie may painful sick bed mother hand sit looking loving eyes gaze towards setting sun fancy golden capes islands clouds seas lakes blue sky infinite rest peace far west sends rest peace young heart till sit silent happy know sweet music fills heart noble tender instincts need thoughts words ay even watch raging thunderstorm feel spite great awfulness beautiful turn eyes away times lady speaking soul souls saying child world new place strange often terrible afraid 
come right last 
rest conquer restlessness faith conquer fear order conquer disorder health conquer sickness joy conquer sorrow pleasure conquer pain life conquer death right conquer wrong 
well last 
keep soul body pure humble busy pious one word good ere die die may glimpse everlasting hear ears body spirit men rational beings plants animals ay stones beneath feet clouds head planets suns away farthest space singing eternally thou art worthy lord receive glory honor power thou hast created things thy pleasure created 
chapter ii earthquakes looking beautiful drawing ruin arica illustrated london news puzzled made sad 
want know god killed people mothers among little children alas dear child answer done wrong asking dear child 
asked human child god merely cleverer sort animal ape read write cast accounts 
therefore content ought content asking things happen must go ask 
content knowing causes things knew natural science ever ever known men would satisfy would tell causes things souls want know reasons things besides though may able tell reasons things show aught tiny glimpse called day glory lady yet believe somehow somewhen somewhere learn something reason things 
thirst know put hearts little children god believe god would never given thirst meant satisfy 
understand 
trust understand day 
meanwhile think say think know told humble must whenever speak lady may guess something like good reason terrible earthquakes south america 
wish hard upon poor people great affliction help thinking hundreds years past something like bible calls tempting god staking property lives upon chances earthquakes coming ought known earthquake might come day 
fulfilled little thought would fulfilled soon parable told nation likes lived careless happy foot burning mountain would warned smoke came top slag cinders lay till mountain blew destroyed miserably 
think ought expected earthquake 
well us judge one especially live part world 
think know ought known enough earthquakes prudent many year 
least hope though would learn lesson till year learn listen message think madam brought spoken voice thunder written letters flame 
dear child landlord house habit pulling roof upon heads putting gunpowder foundations blow us think know meant even though never spoke word would wrong behaving course one thing would certain intend us live house longer could help giving us rough fashion notice quit 
seems poor spanish americans received landlord landlords wrong notice quit perhaps people ever says unmistakable words must leave country perish 
believe message like lady messages heart merciful loving one spaniards would leave western coast peru cross andes green forests eastern side land might live free earthquakes would good industrious become great rich happy nation instead idle useless afraid good people 
eastern part land god gifts waiting paradise neither describe conceive precious woods fruits drugs boundless wealth one word waiting send waters mighty river amazon enriching us old world enriching new 
would go use gifts god instead neglecting three hundred years would blessing earth instead 
god grant dear child poor people may take warning sent voice god revealed facts great lord bacon would called see god bidden leave place prepared land home thousand times better live 
ask ought known earthquake would come well make understand must talk little earthquakes makes order find let us try simplest cause think 
wise scientific plan 
whatever makes earthquakes must enormously strong certain 
strongest thing know world think gunpowder well gunpowder strong sometimes always 
may carry flask hand weak enough 
becomes strong turned gas steam 
steam always strong 
look railway engine still ever seen god forbid boiler explosion would agree strongest thing know world steam 
think explain almost quite know earthquakes believe whole caused steam gases expanding spreading wonderful quickness strength 
course must something make expand heat 
talk yet 
remember riddle put day rattling lid kettle hartford bridge flat lifted ancient sea answer riddle believe steam done 
lid kettle rattles expanding steam escapes little jets causes lid quake 
suppose steam earth trying escape earth one place loose yet hard lid kettle loose yet hard cracks may like crack edge lid edge kettle might steam try escape cracks rattle surface earth cause earthquake steam would escape generally easily would make passing rattle like earthquake famous jester charles selwyn said quite young one tame might stroked like felt pyrenees gave solemn thoughts though first nothing laugh tell 
traveling pyrenees came one evening loveliest spot glen rather vast crack mountains narrow room anything bottom save torrent roaring walls polished rock 
high torrent road cut among cliffs road rose cliffs great black cavern mouths hundreds feet heads poured foaming waterfalls streams large enough turn mill mountains piled mountains covered woods box smelt rich hot musky warm spring air 
among box trees fallen boulders grew hepaticas blue white red see garden little stars gentian azure azure sky 
box woods rose giant silver firs clothing cliffs glens tall black spires till stood last jagged saw edge purple evening sky along mountain ranges thousands feet aloft beyond head valley rose vast cones virgin snow miles away reality looking brilliant near one fancied first moment one could touched one hand 
snow white stood glorious things seven thousand feet air watched beautiful white sides turn rose color evening sun set fade dull cold gray till bright moon came light 
tired wondering admiring went bed dream dream alice went wonderland dream dare say may ere 
noise stir puts fancy sleep whole long dream account yet dream seems hours long taken second time noise begins dream wakes end 
dreamed english people come hotel sleeping room underneath quarrelled fought broke bed tremendous crash must get stop fight moment woke heard coming valley north roar never heard since hundred railway trains rolling underground passed bed tremendous thump jumped bed quicker ever life heard roaring sound die away rolled valley towards peaks snow 
still head notion englishmen fighting room 
recollected englishmen come night room bed 
opened window woman screamed dog barked cocks hens cackled disturbed humor could hear nothing roaring torrent hundred feet 
flashed across noise burst laughing said earthquake went bed next morning inquired whether one heard noise 
nobody heard anything 
driver brought valley winked choose speak 
last breakfast asked pretty little maid waited meaning noise heard night answered intense amusement ah bah ce n etait qu un tremblement de terre il en ici toutes les six semaines 
secret 
little maid found came lowland far away mind telling truth good people place afraid let earthquakes every six weeks fear frightening visitors away really good people kind shall tell name place 
course could less ask madam civilly made earthquakes particular place hundreds miles away burning mountain answer thought gave though conceited say sure 
come valley seen cliffs beautiful gray limestone marble place replaced granite may see london bridge aberdeen 
mean limestone changed granite granite risen bottom valley carried limestone suppose back hundreds feet air 
caves waterfalls pouring mouths one level top granite bottom limestone 
expected explain day water make caves easily limestone never think granite 
knew besides cold springs came caves hot springs also full curious chemical salts house 
went look found came rock limestone granite joined 
ah said think madam answer 
lid one great steam boilers rather shaky cracked granite broken torn limestone lifted hot water boiler actually oozing crack earthquake heard last night simply steam rumbling thumping inside trying get 
dear child fell serious mood 
said stream little little stronger rock little weaker would laughing matter village might shaken ground rocks hurled torrent jets steam hot water mixed may deadly gases roared riven ground might happened short happened happens still hundred places world whenever rocks weak stand pressure steam solid earth bursts engine boiler bursts steam within strong 
thoughts came mind humor jest young earthquakes madam boilers rather say wise man old lord mercies consumed 
strange terrible also tricks underground steam plays 
make ground seems us hard firm roll rock waves till people sea sick board ship rocking motion common often slight set bells ringing steeples make furniture things shelves jump quaintly enough 
make trees bend fro wind blowing open doors suddenly shut slam make timbers floors roofs creak ship sea give men frights one dock keepers liverpool got earthquake watchbox rocked thought one going pitch dock 
little hints warnings 
strong enough rock houses churches heaps ruins leaves standing crack top bottom must pulled rebuilt 
saw pictures ruins arica talk began guess well enough town looks like ruined earthquake 
misery horror follow ruin talk darken young spirit sad thoughts grown people must face ought face 
strangeness tricks earthquake shocks play hardly explained even scientific men 
sometimes would seem force runs round making solid ground eddy water eddies brook 
make straight rows trees crooked twist whole walls round rather ground walls stand without throwing shift stones pillar one sideways giant trying spin like teetotum screwed half pieces 
story told wise man saw place whole furniture one house hurled away earthquake buried ruins another house things carried hundreds yards neighbors went law settle true owner 
sometimes shock seems come neither horizontally waves circularly eddies vertically straight things people alas sometimes thrown earth high air things spring table strike smartly enough underneath 
law law every sort motion earthquake shock sometimes hurls great rocks cliff valley 
shock runs mountain till comes cliff end face cliff loose flies air 
may see thing happen put marbles billiard balls row touching strike one nearest smartly line row 
balls stand still except last one flies 
shock like earthquake shock run end one nothing beyond soft air moved grow old learn mathematics know law motion according happens learn apply billiard balls taught explain wonders earthquake 
case many must watch madam work little common things find works great rare ones 
solomon says fool eyes ends earth always looking strange things seen could understand saw instead looking petty commonplace matters feet day long getting sound knowledge art getting sound knowledge still 
another terrible destruction earthquake brings close seaside wash great sea wave swept last year upon island st thomas west indies swept upon coast peru year 
sea moans sinks back leaving shore dry comes offing mighty wall water high higher many tall house sweeps far inland washing away quays houses carrying great ships sweeps back leaving ships high dry ships left peru year 
wave made let us think 
perhaps many ways 
two tell simply seem likely probably common 
suppose earthquake shock ran making earth sea heave fall long earth waves sea bottom sank 
water would sink leave shore dry till sea bottom rose hurled water land 
one way explaining may true 
certain earthquakes move bottom sea certain move water sea also tremendous force 
ships sea earthquake feel blow though harm sailors often rush upon deck fancying struck upon rock force could give ship floating water blow would strong enough hurl thousands tons water beach land 
another way accounting great sea wave fancy comes true sometimes 
suppose put empty india rubber ball water blow pipe 
course know ball filled upper side would rise water 
suppose party little ants moving upon ball fancying great island perhaps whole world would think ball filling growing bigger could see sides basin tub ball sure move would soon judge moving ball rising water 
ants short sighted could see sides basin would apt make mistake would like men island sight land 
would impossible tell whether moving whether water moving whether ball rising water water sinking away ball 
would probably say water sinking leaving ball dry 
understand think would happen pricked hole ball 
air inside would come hissing ball would sink water 
ants would probably fancy opposite 
little heads would full notion ball solid could move heads full notion earth solid move would say ah water rising 
believe sea seems ebb away earthquake land really raised sea hundreds miles coast perhaps whole island force steam gas imprisoned ground 
steam stretches strains solid rocks till bear snap crack frightful roar clang holes chasms ground rush steam gases often foul poisonous ones hot water mud flame strange stones signs great boiler burst last 
strain eased 
earth sinks together ball pricked sinks lower perhaps back rushes sea earth thrust away rose sweeps destroying 
course great deal said time tell 
read hope grow writings far wiser men perhaps may feel foreign lands actual shock great earthquake see work fresh done around 
ever happens preserved danger learn trust earthquakes teach bear mind simple general rules understanding given 
seem satisfied yet want know oh earthquake england night asleep seems near pleasant 
ever earthquakes england throw houses bury people ruins dear child think may set heart rest upon point 
far history england goes back thousand years account earthquake done serious damage killed believe single human 
little earthquakes sometimes felt england run generally one line country devonshire wales severn valley cheshire lancashire south west scotland felt smartly believe rocks harder tossed earthquakes happened ages ages ago long man lived earth 
show work earthquakes day tilting twisting layers rock cracks faults called run different directions 
showed recollect chalk cliff ramsgate two set cracks sloping opposite ways told made two separate sets earthquakes long long ago perhaps chalk still bottom deep sea 
even rocky parts england earthquake force seems died 
perhaps crust earth become thick solid much shaken gases steam 
eastern part england meanwhile little chance earthquake ever much harm ground thousands feet hard rocky soft sands clays chalk sands clays soft limestones clays act buffers deaden earthquake shocks deaden earthquake noise 
put ear one end soft bolster let one hit end 
hear hardly noise feel blow 
put ear one end hard piece wood let one hit 
hear smart tap perhaps feel smart tap 
older learn laws sound motion among particles bodies know 
meanwhile may comfort thought madam doubtless command lady prepared safe soft bed good people britain may lie sleep work till plant build manufacture thrive peace comfort trust pray many hundred years come 
steam inside earth likely us raise parts island hartford bridge flats raised ages ago old icy sea slowly probably man tell whether rising 
steam power may even dying island letting parts sink slowly sea wise friends mine think fens norfolk cambridgeshire sinking 
shown kind work gone norfolk brow sandringham hill sea cliff dersingham bog foot shallow sea therefore land risen 
hunstanton station beach sea shells twenty feet high water mark showing land risen likewise 
farther north brancaster forests oak fir alder roots still soil far high water mark uncovered low tide plain sign land sunk 
surely recollect sunken forest brancaster beautiful shells picked gullies millions live pholases boring clay peat firm dry land fed giant oxen giant stags likewise perhaps mammoth great woolly elephant whose teeth fishermen dredge sea outside recollect remember norfolk shore changed slowly surely whole world changing around us 
hartford bridge flat instance changed ages ago gravelly bottom sea 
steam power underground raised slowly long ages till became dry land 
ages hence perhaps become sea bottom 
washed slowly rain sunk dying steam power underground go place whence came 
seas roll stand new lands rise seas roll 
things earth tiniest flower tallest mountain change change day long 
every atom matter moves perpetually nothing continues one stay 
solid seeming earth stand heaving bubble bursting ever anon place 
one move change yesterday day ever 
child bubble earth mankind depend 
yet told peruvians ought expected earthquake 
true 
tell another time 
chapter iii volcanos want know spaniards peru ecuador expected earthquake 
many already 
shaking ground country gone perpetually till almost ceased care always hoping heavy shock would come terribly mistaken 
instance province quito year thirty forty thousand people killed earthquake 
one would thought warning enough warning taken year thousands killed country way 
might expected much 
towns built close volcanos highest terrible world 
wherever volcanos earthquakes 
may earthquakes without volcanos volcanos without earthquakes seldom never 
come pass volcano make earthquakes may rather say earthquakes trying make volcanos 
volcanos holes steam underground burst open may escape air 
chimneys great blast furnaces underground madam pounds melts old rocks make new ones spread land 
many volcanos world heard vesuvius course italy etna sicily hecla iceland 
heard kilauea sandwich islands pele hair yellow threads lava like fine spun glass blown pools fire sandwich islanders believed hair goddess lived crater read hope miss yonge book golden deeds noble story christian chieftainess order persuade subjects become christians also went crater defied goddess volcano came back unhurt triumphant 
look map see many many 
get keith johnston physical atlas schoolroom course schoolroom without physical atlas like needle without eye look map called phenomena volcanic action 
see many red dots mark volcanos still burning black dots mark burning time long ago scattered world 
sometimes single like red dot otaheite easter island pacific 
sometimes groups clusters like cluster sandwich islands friendly islands new zealand

understand earthquakes common round volcanos understand would worst volcano breaks steam trying escape understand people live near volcanos glad see blazing spouting hope steam found way make earthquakes 
still merely foolish speculation chance 
volcanos never trusted 
one knows one break live close city naples close mount vesuvius must astonished blown swallowed great beautiful city naples may without warning day 
happened mount vesuvius nearly years ago old roman times ages ages lying quiet like hill 
beautiful cities built foot filled people handsome comfortable afraid wicked people ever earth

staying shore sister sat study called see strange cloud hanging time top mount vesuvius 
shape like pine tree course like one branching scotch firs like italian stone pine long straight stem flat parasol shaped top 
sometimes blackish sometimes spotted good admiral pliny always curious natural science ordered cutter went away across bay see could 
earthquake shocks common last days suppose pliny notion earthquakes cloud aught 
however soon found cost 
got near opposite shore sailors met entreated turn back 
cinders pumice stones falling sky flames breaking mountain 
pliny would go said people danger duty help must see strange cloud note different shapes changed 
hot ashes fell faster faster sea ebbed suddenly left nearly dry pliny turned away place called stabiae house friend pomponianus going escape boat 
brave pliny told afraid ordered bath like true roman gentleman went dinner cheerful face 
flames came mountain nearer nearer night drew pliny persuaded friend fires villages peasants fled went bed slept soundly 
however middle night found courtyard fast filled cinders woke admiral time would never able get house 
earthquake shocks grew stronger fiercer till house ready fall pliny friend sailors slaves fled open fields amid shower stones cinders tying pillows heads prevent beaten 
day come time dawn still pitch dark night 
went boats upon shore sea raged horribly getting board 
pliny grew tired made men spread sail lay came upon rush flames horrible smell sulphur ran lives 
slaves tried help admiral upon legs sank overpowered brimstone fumes left behind 
came back lay dead clothes order face quiet sleeping

going meantime clouds ashes cinders mud lava three happy cities buried herculaneum pompeii stabiae 
buried people fled leaving furniture earthenware often even jewels gold behind among human time escape dreadful deluge dust 
ruins herculaneum pompeii dug since paintings especially pompeii found upon walls still fresh preserved air ashes covered 
older perhaps go naples see famous museum curiosities dug ruined cities walk suppose along streets pompeii see wheel tracks pavement along carts chariots rumbled years ago 
meanwhile go nearer home crystal palace pompeian court called see exact model one old buried houses copied even paintings wells judge far little boy judge sort life thoughtless luckless people lived years ago 
become vesuvius treacherous mountain half half side old crater blown away left called monte somma stands half circle round new cone new crater burning day 
true eruption killed pliny vesuvius fell asleep awake years years growing restless ages passed hardly year passes without sending smoke stones crater streams lava sides 
suppose want know volcano like cone crater lava volcano like easy enough show simply beautifully shaped mountains alike world whether large small 
almost every volcano world believe shape see drawing opposite even volcanos sandwich islands often heard great lakes boiling fire upon flat downs without cone 
believe volcanos fallen ages ago java whole burning mountain fell night th august year 
short terrible earthquake bright cloud suddenly covered whole mountain 
people dwelt around tried escape poor souls could get away earth sunk beneath feet whole mountain fell swallowed noise great cannon fired 
forty villages nearly people destroyed mountain plain red hot stones 
way year top mountain quito fell single night leaving two immense peaks rock behind pouring great floods mud mixed dead fish underground lakes among volcanos swarm little fish never see light 
volcanos say shape one see 
cotopaxi quito feet height 
sloping sides made cinders ashes braced together suppose bars solid lava stone inside prevent whole crumbling 
upper part see white snow far line feet sea mountain tropics close equator snow lie hot climate lower 
snow melts rushes mountain side floods water mud cindery cone cotopaxi stands black dreadful clear blue sky people country know coming 
mountain growing hot inside melts snowy covering soon burst forth smoke steam red hot stones earthquakes shake ground roars heard may hundreds miles away 
words cone crater lava 
make understand words see volcanos must general shape cotopaxi 
cone crater lava words make alphabet volcano learning 
cone outside huge chimney crater mouth 
lava ore melted furnace may flow surface old land make new land instead 
furnace tell roots mountains depths sea path fowl knoweth vulture eye hath seen lion whelp hath trodden fierce lion passed 
putteth forth hand upon rock overturneth mountain roots cutteth rivers among rocks eye seeth every precious thing like little ants run outside earth scratching like ants feet calling deep ravine peeping feet crater volcano unable guess precious things may lie even fire blazes roars thin crust earth 
inside earth know nothing whatsoever know average several times heavy solid rock know 
let us look chimney comes see little 
volcano like cone cause molehill like cone though rough one little heaps burrowing beetles make moor ant lions france make sand something shape cone hole like crater middle 
beetle ant lion little scale steam inside earth great scale 
forced vent outside air tears rocks underground grinds small often finest dust blasts hole made 
fall back hole shot fall round hole close fewer farther till piled ring round sand piled round beetle burrow 
days weeks months goes even may hundreds years till great cone formed round steam vent hundreds thousands feet height dust stones cinders likewise 
recollect steam blown away cold earth rock near surface ground begins blowing hot rocks red hot white hot last actually melted 
hurled cool air become ashes cinders blocks stone making hill fall bigger bigger continually 
thus wise madam stand need bricklayers makes chimneys build 
mouth chimney called crater crater know greek cup 
mouth chimneys become choked stopped working often shape cup germans call kessels means kettles caldrons 
seen beautifully exactly rounded cunning engineer planned dug spade 
first course sides bottom nothing loose stones cinders slag ashes would thrown furnace 
madam whenever makes ugly desolate place always tries cover ugliness set something green grow make pretty often often worn craters 
seen covered short sweet turf like many chalk downs 
seen filled bushes held woodcocks wild boars 
came beautiful round crater top mountain filled bottom splendid crop potatoes 
though madam put least taught honest germans put 
often madam turns worn craters beautiful lakes 
many crater lakes italy see ever go may see english galleries painted wilson famous artist died born 
recollect lord macaulay ballad battle lake regillus lake regillus recollect right one round crater lakes 
many deep clear blue lakes seen eifel germany many curious plant picked shores steam blasted earthquake roared ash clouds rushed high heaven buried land around dust fertile soil 
long puzzle find water stood craters others within mile perhaps perfectly dry 
never found 
learned men tell ashes fall back crater bottom wet rain sometimes set called hard cement make bottom great bowl waterproof made earthenware 
gives craters cup shape first think steam stones blown crater open funnel less upright walls inside 
steam grows weaker fewer fewer stones fall outside fall back inside 
last quite choke bottom great round hole 
perhaps lava melted rock underneath cools grows hard chokes hole lower 
round edge crater stones cinders roll inward 
rains wash wind blows 
roll middle meet stop 
gradually steep funnel becomes round cup 
may prove must try 
know dig round hole ground leave crumble sure become cup shaped last though first sides may quite upright like bucket know get trowel make little experiment 
ought understand cone crater mean 
think may guess would come volcano broke eruption usually called 
first clouds steam dust would call smoke volleys stones cool burning hot last lies lowest melted rock called lava 
would come top chimney top cone 
madam told usually makes things make 
made chimney furnace make next make furnace door make 
melted lava rises crater funnel inside cone never gets top 
enormously heavy sides cone bear weight give way low 
ashes cinders melted lava burrows twisting twirling like enormous fiery earth worm till gets air outside runs mountain stream fire 
may see seen vesuvius two eruptions one burning stones one melted lava 
lava think must tell another time 
speak shall tell madam ways making ground stand say 
want know dare say eruption volcano like may read follows 
see happen never good fortune seeing mountain burning though seen many many one burnt extinct volcanos called 
man saw good friend mine good man science also went last year see eruption vesuvius main crater small one risen suddenly outside gave leave told writing children tell saw 
new cone said feet high perhaps feet across top 
stood safe go smoke rolled top rosy pink glare caldron faint greenish blueish silver indescribable beauty light moon

know scotch saying make broth whinstones name lava 
though clever people wrong 
never saw broth scotland far know whinstones gone making scotch boy eaten many bit whinstone better 
course simply put whinstones kettle boiled would get much rough cookery 
madam best delicate cooks knows pound soak stew whinstones delicately make sauce seasoning meat vegetables puddings almost everything eat put veins things spouted red hot volcanos ages ages since perhaps bottom ancient seas firm dry land 
strange madam doings 
would think stranger still ever seen flowing lava stream 
cave slag cinders black hillside rushes golden river flowing like honey yet tough thrust stick heavy great stones throw float top carried like corks water 
hot stand near seconds hotter perhaps fire ever saw flows outside cools cool air gets covered slag cinders something like may see thrown furnaces black country staffordshire 
sometimes cling together lava stream make tunnel cracks may see fiery river rushing roaring 
mostly kept broken apart roll slide top lava crashing clanging grind together horrid noise 
course stream like streams runs towards lower grounds 
slides glens fills beds streams driving water hissing steam sometimes iceland years ago falls cliff turning water fall fire fall filling pool blocks lava suddenly cooled clang roar like chains shaken brazen vessels beaten heard miles miles away 
course woe crops gardens stand way 
crawls eats 
shoves houses sets woods fire sends steam gas tree trunks hissing air 
curiously enough often without touching trees 
flows round trunks wood sandwich islands years ago course sets fire heat till nothing left blackened posts 
moisture comes poor tree steam blows hard lava round never touch tree round hole left middle lava tree 
sometimes lava spit liquid fire among branches trees hangs afterwards tassels slag yet means steam branches prevent liquid fire burning anything scorch bark 
tell curious story still 
lava stream must know continually sending little jets gas steam may brought inside earth suspect comes damp herbage damp soil runs 
may lava stream mount etna sicily came straight upon town catania 
everybody thought town would swallowed poor people knew better began pray st agatha famous saint say martyred ages ago fancy power heaven save lava stream 
really happened enough make ignorant people think st agatha saved 
lava stream came straight upon town wall 
another foot would touched begun shoving force compared battering rams ever read ancient histories would child toys 
lo behold lava stream got within inches wall stopped began rear upright build wall beside wall 
rose rose till believe one place overtopped wall began curl crest 
expected would fall town last stopped cooled hardened left town unhurt 
inhabitants said course st agatha done learned men found usual madam done making 
lava full gas continually blowing little jets reached wall actually blew back wall wall luckily strong enough blown lava kept blowing back till time cool 
dear child miracle matter poor people catania thank st agatha interference simply preserve destroy laws nature breath mouth servants 
many case lava stop 
rolls downs valleys till reaches sea shore hawaii sandwich islands year 
cools course often killed fish sulphurous gases heat perhaps miles around 
good reason believe fossil fish often find rocks perfect every bone lying sometimes heaps twisted seen died suddenly violently killed way either heat lava streams else bursting gases poisoning water earthquakes eruptions bottom sea 
could tell many stories fish killed thousands earthquakes volcanos last years 
time tell everything 
ask astonishment ever possible use destroying streams fire certainly ever seen lava stream even cool looked done great river rough black blocks streaming away far wide land would think hideous useless thing ever saw 
yet dear child one told men judge according appearance judge righteous judgment 
said matters spiritual human quite true matters natural also work obey 
seen seen close round edges lava streams sometimes actually upon upon great bed dust ashes hurled far wide ancient volcanos happy homesteads rich crops hemp flax wheat tobacco lucerne roots vineyards laden white purple grapes would begun suspect lava streams bad neighbors 
tell volcanic soils called soil first lava ashes generally richest soils world instance one told day soil beautiful island madeira thin dig two three inches without coming solid rock lava harder even obsidian black glass volcanos sometimes make old mexicans used chip swords arrows steel soil thin yet fertile used grown grapes famous madeira wine made remember remember lothians scotland shall say little perhaps agree lady wrong setting madam pour lava ashes upon surface earth

animals drowned driven away nothing left alive perhaps except little hardy plants clung cracks gullies mountain tops whose descendants live still 
dreadful time worst perhaps age ice ends second chapter fairy tale

chapter vii chalk carts want know next caves old savages lived made curious things inside got forth 
well talk good time coming hill oh chalk carts 
chalk carts seems chalk carts things want follow far enough mean feet along public road thoughts along road sorry say public yet know much shall come cave understand cave made 
meanwhile hurry say chalk cart mouse dead leaf 
chalk carts like mice dead leaves matters universe curious odd things eyes wise reasonable people 
whenever hear young men saying begin suspect belonging noble army sages much less noble army martyrs ignoble army noodles think nothing interesting important dinners balls races back biting neighbors sorry see enlisting regiment grow 
think chalk carts odd curious things think 
mind curious question men ever thought inventing wheels first thought 
curious question men ever found could make horses work began tame instead eating curious question think shall never get answered first horse tamer lived country 
curious beautiful sight see two noble horses obeying little boy could kill single kick 
beside question ought curious one suspect answer farmer take trouble send cart horses eight miles draw chalk odiham chalk pit oh going put land course 
chalking bit top next field copse grubbed 
good putting chalk chalk rich fertile like manure altogether poor barren stuff know ought know 
recollect chalk cuttings banks railway basingstoke winchester utterly barren 
though open thirty years blade grass hardly bit moss grown grow perhaps centuries 
come let us find something chalk talk caves 
chalk caves learn thing lies nearest good rule duty lies nearest 
let us come grubbed bit ask farmer gig 
well old friend little boy wants know putting chalk field 
ever tries farm round learn first rule chalk wheat 
tell young squire 
want see comes look freshly grubbed land sour 
see color black red green yellow full sour iron let nothing grow 
chalk year two colors gone turn nice wholesome brown like rest field know land sweet fit crop 
mind tell tell something 
put chalk beside sweetening land hold water 
see land though often wet springs sandy hungry drain bottom water top water rain apt run fast dries burns get plant wheat turnips either 
put chalk hold water keep ground moist 
lumps chalk hold water made like cups 
made like sponges serves turn better still 
take lump young squire see water enough rather looking staring face 
one side lump thick ice 

water inside chalk last night till froze 
came squeezing holes chalk strings may see break ice across 
may judge much water load chalk hold even dry summer day 
excuse sir must market 
true farmer said quite true believe 
scientific man know chemical causes things knowledge sound useful comes long experience 
forefathers perhaps thousand years farming country reading madam books keen eyes experimenting watching carefully rationally making mistakes often failing losing crops money learning mistakes till empiric knowledge called helps grow sometimes quite good crops learned agricultural chemistry 
meant chalk sweetening land would understand yet hardly tell chemists yet agreed happens 
right right told water inside chalk important us follow shall surely come cave last 
water chalk 
see chalk downs winchester always green even hottest summer madam put great chalk sponge 
winter rains soak summer heat draws rain invisible steam coming keep roots turf cool moist blazing sun 
love short turf well 
love run race downs butterfly net hunt chalk hill blues marbled whites spotted burnets till hot tired sit look quiet little old city long cathedral roof tower st cross gray old walls buildings shrouded noble trees embosomed among soft rounded lines chalk hills begin feel thirsty cry oh springs brooks downs home hollows dry hill tops

yes 
true let flow ever world lady rules madam obeys 
exist like everything else sun heaven gnat dances beam condition working whether wish whether know 
idle stream fit chatter bathe fish waters even give poets beautiful fancies 
little guess work 
one daughters madam like work night day know though lady must know 
day day night night sleeping never sleep carry delicate soft burden giants could bear yet never tired 
every drop rain south west wind brings west indian seas gives fresh life strength bear burden need every drop rain lays fresh burden 
every root weed grows every field every dead leaf falls highwoods many parish grange woodmancote round farleigh preston brighton alresford downs ay every atom manure farmers put land foul enough pure enough touches giving tiny atom men call carbonic acid melts tiny grain chalk helps send solid hill one million pores veins feed burden springs 
ages ages worked thus carrying chalk sea 
ages ages may shall work yet till done work last levelled high downs flat sea shore beds flint gravel rattling shallow waves 
might tell told would surely think clumsy chalk cart rumbling hill graceful stream bearing silently invisible load chalk see much delicate beautiful well vast wonderful madam work man 
asked nymph worked ever could tell 
like nymphs old hamadryads lived trees undine little sea maiden would soul reason power say 
reasonable guess least listen guess say perhaps say perhaps chalk may going make layers rich marl sea england france marl beds may upheaved grow dry land ploughed sowed reaped wiser race men better ordered world chalk may even nobler destiny 
may happen happened already many grain lime 
may carried thousands miles away help building coral reef must tell afterwards 
coral reef may harden limestone beds 
beds may covered pressed may heated till crystallise white marble fairer statues carved grander temples built world ever yet seen 
reason chalk sent sea another reason probably far better one 
told first lady intentions far wiser better fancies like obeys able exceeding abundantly beyond ask think 
say followed chalk cart long way without coming cave 
wrong 
come mouth cave 
say open sesame like ali baba tale forty thieves word two madam teach us forthwith hill open shall walk behold rivers cascades underground stalactite pillars stalagmite statues wonders grottoes adelsberg antiparos kentucky 
joking yes yet know joke usually earnest 
least 
caves chalk ever heard 
though limestone harder kind chalk 
madam could turn chalk hard limestone believe even ways one ways would comfortable profitable us southern folk live 
afraid squeezing heating would flatten us phosphatic fossils inch thick turn winchester city breccia would puzzle geologists hundred thousand years hence 
hope leave chalk downs itchen wash gently away talk caves madam scoops water underground way roughly melts chalk 
suppose hills instead soft spongy chalk hard limestone marble like font church made 
rainwater instead sinking chalk would run ground hill came crack fault called would run rock ran would eat hole wider wider year year make swallow hole may see plenty ever go whernside high hills yorkshire unfathomable pits green turf may hear water tinkling trickling far far underground 
go step farther may understand bones animals often found limestone caves 
swallow holes many beasts must fall either hurry fright hunted lions bears cruel beasts often still time snow holes covered drift died open hill sides bones might washed floods along mud stones buried cave beside lions bears hyaenas might live caves know caves drag bones caves mouths savages might live cave bring animals eat like wild beasts bones might mixed know things savages left behind like flint tools beads whole would hardened dripping limestone water paste breccia like drawer 
bones savages would seldom never find mixed unless one fallen accident 
question merely simply men god put hearts men even lowest savages sort reverence gone taught bury way take care bones 
swallow hole sure end cave help making cave time

water must run somewhere eats way beds rock making underground galleries last caves lofty halls

stalactites tell seen among beautiful madam work sometimes like branches roses grapes sometimes like statues sometimes like delicate curtains know beautiful shapes 
never seen sorry say therefore describe 
made way way little straight stalactites may seen hanging like icicles vaulted cellars arches bridge 
water melts lime carry drops making fresh limestone grain grain drips roof fresh limestone splashes floor till dripped long enough stalactite hanging would meet stalagmite rising join one straight round white graceful shaft would seem seem support roof cave 
cave though always mouth run stream water seems clear crystal though actually like itchen winchester full lime full lime makes beds fresh limestone called travertine may see italy greece asia minor perhaps petrifies call weeds bed like dropping well knaresborough often seen picture

beyond cave goes subterranean streams cascades halls man yet knows far 
friend mine last year went farther believe one yet gone instead taking indian torches made bark resin even torches made spanish wax brave bishop parts used went farther one took beautiful magnesium light seen often home 
one place lighted magnesium found hall full feet high higher far dome st paul solemn thought said seen human ever seen ray light ever struck stupendous roof ages since making world 
found something expect disappointed something expect 
indians warned hole floor told unfathomable abyss 
lo behold turned magnesium light upon said abyss eight feet deep 
wonder poor indians little smoky torches make mistakes wonder afraid enter far gloomy vaults believe souls ancestors live dark cave say die go guacharos call birds fly doleful screams cave feed night daylight roost sleep 
guacharo birds wonderful part story 
indians kill eat fat although believe evil spirits 
scientific men studied birds tell wonderful indians fancies true 
great birds three feet across wings somewhat like owls somewhat like cuckoos somewhat like goatsuckers whole unlike anything world instead feeding moths mice feed upon hard dry fruits pick trees set sun 
wise men tell making bird giving peculiar way life settling cavern caverns part world therefore making caverns ready live madam must taken ages ages imagine count 
among harder lessons come latter part madam book 
children need learn yet never learn unless master alphabet short easy lessons beginners trying teach 
recollected couple stupid fellows 
talking time chalk limestone forgotten settle made 
must think next time 
us least mean scientific men use terms without defining plain english talk know 
chapter viii madam two grandsons want know chalk suppose mean chalk made yes 

help calling help great giant whose name analysis 
giant yes 
call tell curious story younger brother every word true 
upon time certainly long ago first man perhaps first rational kind created madam two grandsons 
elder called analysis younger synthesis 
father mother many disputes question think children may leave alone present 
part believe like st patrick gentlemen come decent people great respect affection long keeps place minds business 
must understand soon two baby giants born lady sets everything work exactly fitted set work 
analysis take pieces everything found find made 
synthesis put pieces together make something fresh 
word analysis teach men science synthesis teach art 
analysis elder madam commanded synthesis never put pieces together till analysis taken completely apart 
child synthesis obeyed rule good old grandmother world would far happier wealthier wiser better 
synthesis would 
grew noble boy 
could carve could paint could build could make music write poems full conceit haste 
whenever elder brother tried little patient work taking things pieces synthesis snatched work hands quarter done began putting together suit fancy course put together wrong 
went bully elder brother locked prison starved till many hundred years poor analysis never grew remained dwarfed stupid blind want light synthesis hasty conceited people followed grew stout strong tyrannous overspread whole world ruled 
fault work synthesis would work 
watches would keep time soldiers would fight ships would sail houses would keep rain 
every time failed work go poor analysis dungeon bully taking thing two pieces giving sound facts go till came grief boasting meantime analysis found facts 
last grew conceited fancied knew madam could teach lady either understood things heaven earth real heaven earth thinking sham heaven sham earth built guesses fancies 
synthesis waxed pride trampled upon poor brother reckless grew willing deceive 
real flowers would grow cut paper flowers painted said would well natural ones 
dolls would work put strings wires behind make nod heads open eyes persuaded people perhaps half persuaded alive 
hand weather glass went nailed insure fine day tortured burnt murdered every one said keep 
many foolish wicked things little boys need hear yet 
last punishment came according laws grandmother madam like laws medes persians alter mankind sooner later find grew rich powerful grew careless lazy thought nothing eating drinking till people began despise 
one day left dungeon analysis ill guarded analysis got ran away 
great hue cry terribly would punished caught 
lo behold folks grown disgusted synthesis began take part analysis 
poor men hid cottages scholars studies 
war arose terrible wars arise good kings wise statesmen gallant soldiers spent treasure lives fighting 
honest folk welcomed honest wise folk used instead conceited tyrant like synthesis showed faithful diligent humble servants ready every man work answer every man questions 
among got well fed grew shortly giant ought along many year come perfectly able take care 
poor synthesis really fallen low days one pity 
goes humbly brother feeding scraps thrown snubbed rapped knuckles told one minute hold tongue mind business next business mind till got poor way folks fancy die actually digging grave already composing epitaph 
trying wear bear skin bear killed synthesis dead anything like rise day make good friends brother analysis help nobler beautiful work ever yet done world 
analysis got upper hand much danger spoilt much prosperity brother case fall great deal good 
end story true story 
must remember whenever analysis like fire good servant bad master 
got freedom late years like young men come suddenly masters apt conceited fancy knows everything really knows nothing never know anything knows things different matter 
indeed nowadays pretends teach old grandmother madam suck eggs make eggs bargain good old lady laughs kindly lets run knows grow wiser time learn humility mistakes failures hope 
however analysis clever young giant wonderful work long meddles dead things like bit lime 
take pieces tell things made seems made take pieces tell made till gets conceited fancies find one thing things calls matter things made way ways calls force things made boasts way old madam smiles says child say must remember hundred things forgetting learn hundred thousand things know puts hand eyes master analysis begins groping dark talking saddest nonsense 
beware keep place work flatter get mastery persuade teach thousand things knows duck egg never hatches chicken 
remember master analysis ever grows saucy conceited ask last riddle shut 
analysis explain little dead things like stones inorganic things called 
living things organisms called explain 
meddles always ends like man killed goose get golden eggs 
kill goose flower insect analyze goose corpse goose flower dead stuff flower 
therefore never anything fail tries find life things 
take life first could even find plum pudding made merely analyzing 
might part sugar flour suet might even clever patient honor take every atom sugar flour got mixed every atom brown color got plums currants body pudding aught know put coloring matter back plums currants aught know turn boiled pudding raw one great conjurer madam grandson bound yet would never find pudding made unless one told great secret sailors old story forgot cook boiled cloth 
analysis weak point let calculations apt forget cloth indeed cook likewise 
doubt analyze matter things keep forgetting analyze form 
mean shape child 
mean something makes shape things matter likewise folks lost sight nowadays seem likely get sight hundred years 
suppose need trouble head may follow fashions long last 
piece lime however analysis tell us great deal 
may trust says believe understands says 
think 
took watch pieces would probably spoil ever would perhaps broken certainly mislaid bits even watchmaker could put together 
would analyzed watch wrongly 
watchmaker took pieces watchmaker could put together go well ever understand works fit use power 
put together rightly would proof taken pieces rightly 
master analysis 
take thing pieces brother synthesis put together may sure done work rightly 
take bit chalk pieces shall become several different things none chalk like chalk 
brother synthesis put together shall become chalk 
nearly quite 
every average piece chalk something make chalk unmade 
show presently wonderful tale hangs thereby 
first let analysis tell us chalk made far knows 
say chalk carbonate lime 
carbonate lime made lime carbonic acid 
lime oxide certain metal called calcium 
mean quicklime certain metal mixed oxygen gas slacked lime mixed water 
lime metal 
metal nobody knows 
oxygen gas nobody knows 
well analysis stops short soon 
seem know much matter 
nay nay wrong 
matter know knows great deal accurately know matter 
tell wonderful things oxygen gas air full water full every living thing full changes hard bright steel soft foul rust candle burn without live without 
knows 
ever know lady concern 
meanwhile right find 
want ask next oh carbonic acid 
tell 
carbon oxygen gas 
carbon nobody knows 
stupid analysis fault 
nay nay 
patient 
tell carbon tell carbon well worth knowing 
tell instance every time breathe speak comes mouth carbonic acid breath comes bit slacked lime begin turn back chalk made breath comes leaves growing plant leaf take carbon turn wood 
surely worth knowing may helping make chalk make wood every time breathe 
well curious 
ask carbon tell many things carbon 
diamond carbon blacklead charcoal coke coal part wood part 
analysis say diamond charcoal thing yes 
way taking things pieces must clumsy one find difference diamond charcoal 
well perhaps must remember though old old first man ever lived school last three hundred years 
remember like one else teach 
teach find make tools work dark besides 
think much credit ever found diamond charcoal things 
would never found agree 
taught famous chemist lavoisier ninety years ago burn diamond oxygen difficult trick lavoisier found diamond burnt turned almost entirely carbonic acid water blacklead charcoal turned quantity carbonic acid knew surely man know anything things however different eyes fingers really made thing pure carbon 
makes look feel different analysis know yet 
perhaps find day patient diligent ought 
meanwhile content remember though see milestone yet see farther one neighbors 
indeed neighbors see milestone see outside know things rote like parrots without understanding mean made 
remember chalk carbonate lime made three things calcium oxygen carbon therefore mark caco analysis language hope able read day 
analysis synthesis take chalk pieces put together look chalk oh shepherd crown often find gravel fresh white 
well know 
often told live sea egg covered prickles crawls bottom sea 
well sure master synthesis could put together equally sure master analysis might spend ages taking pieces found made 
lucky day lower chalk south fossils something else mere carbonate lime 
look 
little cockle something like wrinkled hazel nut 
cockle 
madam invented ages ages thought cockles animal lived inside shell different cockle animal sparrow dog 
terebratula gentleman ancient worn family 
kin swarmed old seas even far back time rocks welsh mountains soft mud know read great book sir roderick murchison siluria 
ages rolled got fewer fewer terebratulae hardly left six seven sorts left islands cling stones deep water first time dredged two loch fyne looked awe relics another world lasted unnumbered ages changes one fancy could grasp 
agree master analysis took shell pieces master synthesis would likely put together much less put together right way madam made 
making living animal went growing making making grew shell live 
synthesis found yet first step towards believe never 
would harm trying course 
let everybody try everything fancy 
even fail learned least 
secret would never find least without help microscope greater part lump chalk made things neither analysis perfectly take pieces synthesis put together 
made dead organisms things made living creatures 
washed brushed chalk powder would find full little things like dentalina drawing many curious forms 
show microscope one day 
shells animals called foraminifera shells full holes put tiny arms 
small many may said forty thousand bit chalk inch every way 
numbers past counting whole broken ground finest powder make vast masses england chalk downs foreign countries make whole mountains 
part building stone great pyramid egypt composed told entirely 
get chalk ah indeed let us think 
chalk must laid bottom sea sea shells 
besides find little atomies exactly like alive many seas therefore fair suppose lived sea also 
besides washed chalk sudden flood 
water settled must quite still little delicate creatures would ground powder rather paste 
therefore learned men soon made minds things laid bottom deep sea deep neither wind tide currents could stir everlasting calm 
ah worth thinking shows shrewd giant analysis fast works days got free well fed worth thinking say notions little atomies changed last forty years 
used find sometimes washed among sea sand wild atlantic coast taught days old dr turton writing book british shells bideford call nautili shells like nautilus shells 
men know animal lives like nautilus animal like cow 
nautilus must know made like cuttlefish eyes strong jaws biting arms round heart gills stomach altogether well made beast suspect terrible tyrant little fish sea slugs cuttlefish 
creatures live little shells least finished madam works 
neither mouth stomach eyes limbs 
mere live bags full jelly take almost shape like thrust arms serve arms holes shells contract globigerina 
feed grow make exquisitely formed shells whether indeed strictly speaking animals vegetables analysis yet found

people dig rational men want manure fields 
coprolites well called coprolites first folk fancied leavings fossil animals may really find lias lynn dorsetshire 
say long time ago chalk began made shallow sea england shore covered dead animals bone earth phosphate lime crusted round every bone shell dead sea beast shore got covered fresh sand buried ages mine wealth 
many millions dead creatures must killed know 
know comes pass thin band often inches thick dead creatures stretch way dorsetshire norfolk believe lincolnshire 
stranger still bone earth bed crops south side chalk farnham stretches along foot downs right kent making richest hop lands england surrey away tunbridge 
seems bed lay chalk everywhere could get 
make hop lands rich hops like tobacco vines take phosphorus soil plants grow england washings bone earth bed make lower lands farnham unusually rich garden instance bishop castle grown hops without resting believe three hundred years 
found coprolites ah tell show scientific men ignorant people sometimes laugh dreamers mere pickers useless weeds old stones may real service country countrymen hope day 
clergyman named henslow god honored scientific men kind friend teacher mine loved every little child parish 
calling botany knew something geology 
coprolites brought curiosities fossils 
tale goes wit see like fossils carbonate lime phosphate lime bone earth 
whereon told neighbouring farmers mine wealth opened would use manure 
listened 
others began find eastern counties another man learned wise good noble john paine farnham also god found estate made much use much money tens thousands pounds worth valuable manure made every year cambridgeshire bedfordshire digging land till lately used common farmers crops 
turn coprolites manure used see railway trucks cambridge like home hard pebbles 
grind first mill 
mix sulphuric acid water melts parts two things 
one sulphate lime gypsum commonly called dissolve water little use 
called superphosphate lime dissolve water roots plants suck one richest manures 
oh know put superphosphate grass last year 
yes 
kind better one still 
superphosphate copiolites good superphosphate fresh bones better still therefore dearer fibrine bones full nitrogen like gristle meat washed bone earth bed ages ages ago 
must learn chemistry understand 
like scientific man one find really useful things science 
child saying might find use may fellow men 
man working science however dull dirty work may seem times like one chiffoniers call paris people spend lives gathering rags sifting refuse may put hands moment upon precious jewel 
may able help neighbors find give health wealth may get listen save many foolish experiment ends losing money want science 
heard man want science going throw away great sums believe luckily never could raise money boring coal bagshot sands home 
man thought coal heather moors north must needs coal likewise geologist could told contrary 
another man hennequin lodge near wellington college thought would make poor sands fertile manuring whale oil things world 
lost cost whale oil made land utterly barren unto day want science 
knew manufacturer went bore artesian well water hired regular well borer 
meanwhile wise enough ask geologist parts far thought water 
geologist made calculations said go many feet bagshot sand many feet london clay many feet thanet beds chalk win water feet think till 
well sinker laughed said opinion geologists like 
never found clay england could get feet 
began bore feet began look rather silly last seven feet short geologist foretold came water regular spout 
lo behold expecting bore deep made bore much small sand thanet beds blew bore closed 
poor manufacturer spent hundreds pounds trying get sand vain last make fresh much larger well side old one bewailing day listened well sinker geologist threw away thousand pounds 
answer asked board yacht use learning little matters natural history science seemed use look 
see change country left 
high hills well right 
chalk hills 
chalk sides us 
chilterns away ipsden nettlebed across oxfordshire buckinghamshire hertfordshire royston cambridge lies vale aylesbury see beginning left

rumbling away home last dear old heather moors 
far traveled fancy least since began talk things upon foggy november day first saw madam digging sand banks water spade 
many countries talked wonderful questions got answered grew first question heather moors made yet talked hundredth part things heather moors ought set us thinking
