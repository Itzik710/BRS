catastrophes 
word catastrophe term literature signifies final climax play 
bring catastrophe drama playing method defense easy undertake certain succeed 
advising employ would conceal perils 
conjugal catastrophe may compared one high fevers either carry predisposed subject completely restore health 
thus catastrophe succeeds keeps woman years prudent realms virtue 
moreover method last science able discover present moment 
massacre st bartholomew sicilian vespers death lucretia two embarkations napoleon frejus examples political catastrophe 
power act large scale nevertheless within area dramatic climaxes conjugal life less effective 
since art creating situation transforming introduction natural incidents constitutes genius since return virtue woman whose foot already left tracks upon sweet gilded sand mark pathway vice difficult bring denouements since genius neither knows teaches practitioner conjugal laws feels compelled confess outset incapable reducing definite principles science changeable circumstances delusive opportunity indefinable instinct 
may use expression neither diderot alembert voltaire spite every effort able engraft language conjugal catastrophe se subodore scented afar course sketch imperfectly certain conjugal situations analogous kind thus imitating philosopher ancient time seeking vain explain motion walked forward attempt comprehend laws incomprehensible 
husband accordance principles comprised meditation police expressly forbid wife receive visits celibate suspects lover promised never see 
minor scenes domestic interior leave matrimonial imaginations conjure husband delineate much better betake thought back days delightful longings invited sincere confidences workings policy put motion certain adroitly handled machinery 
let us suppose order make interesting natural scene refer read husband whose carefully organized police made discovery wife profiting hours devoted ministerial banquet probably procured invitation received house z find conditions necessary bring finest possible conjugal catastrophes 
return home time find arrival coincided z would advise interval acts long 
mood enter certainly accordance rules previous meditation 
rage still less 
come good natured carelessness like absent minded man forgotten purse statement drawn minister pocket handkerchief snuff box 
case either catch two lovers together wife forewarned maid hidden celibate 
let us consider two unique situations 
first observe husbands ought always position strike terror homes ought long make preparations matrimonial second september 
thus husband moment wife caused perceive certain first symptoms never fail give time time personal opinion course conduct pursued husband great matrimonial crisis 
say hesitation killing man caught wife feet 
regard discussion thus give rise led aver law ought given husband ancient rome right life death children could slay spurious 
ferocious opinions really bind anything impress wife salutary terror enumerate lightly even laughingly say certainly dear would kill right gladly 
would like murdered woman help fearing pleasantry may day become serious matter crimes impulse certain proof love women know better one else say true things laughingly times suspect husbands feminine trick 
husband surprises wife engaged even innocent conversation lover face still calm produce effect mythologically attributed celebrated gorgon 
order produce favorable catastrophe juncture must act accordance character wife either play pathetic scene la diderot resort irony like cicero rush pistols loaded blank charge even fire think serious row indispensable 
skillful husband may often gain great advantage scene unexaggerated sentimentality 
enters sees lover transfixes glance 
soon celibate retires falls feet wife declaims long speech among phrases occurs dear caroline never able love weeps weeps tearful catastrophe leaves nothing desired 
would explain apropos second method catastrophe may brought motives lead husband vary scene accordance greater less degree strength wife character possesses 
let us pursue subject 
good luck happens wife put lover place concealment catastrophe much successful 
even apartment arranged according principles prescribed meditation easily discern place celibate vanished although like lord byron juan bundled cushion divan 
chance apartment disorder ought sufficient discernment know one place man could bestow 
finally devilish inspiration made small squeezed unimaginable lurking place may expect anything celibate well either wife help casting glance towards mysterious spot pretend look exactly opposite direction nothing easier husband set mouse trap wife 
hiding place discovered must walk straight lover 
must meet face face must endeavor produce fine effect 
face turned three quarters towards must raise head air superiority 
attitude enhance immensely effect aim producing 
essential thing moment overwhelm celibate crushing phrase manufacturing time thus floored coldly show door 
polite relentless executioner axe impassive law 
freezing contempt already probably produced revolution mind wife 
must shouts gesticulations excitement 
men high social rank says young english author never behave like inferiors lose fork without sounding alarm throughout whole neighborhood 
celibate gone find alone wife time must subjugate forever 
therefore stand putting air whose affected calmness betrays profoundest emotion must choose among following topics rhetorically amplified congenial feelings madame must say speak neither vows love much sense much pride make possible overwhelm execrations husbands right utter circumstances least mistakes make would fully justified 
even could indulge either wrath resentment 
outraged much heart frightened public opinion almost always treats ridicule condemnation husband whose wife misbehaved
