chapter xvi path beneath elms remembered last chapter one owen fitzgerald left lady desmond drawing room desmond court somewhat abruptly absolutely refused make peace desmond faction giving consent marriage clara cousin herbert 
perhaps remembered also lady desmond asked consent manner almost humble 
shown anxious keep friendly terms rake hap house rake roue gambler spendthrift reputed would abandon insane claim hand clara desmond 
feeling shown two alone together clara left 
long daughter present lady desmond maintained tone indignation defiance door closed two alone become kind language almost tender 
readers probably conceive acted overcome affection owen fitzgerald fixed resolve win 
men women written always supposed fixed resolves though life seldom found thus armed 
speak truth countess fixed resolve matter either thought owen coming subsequently found alone drawing room 
clara marry much resolved long ago 
danger head may said 
clara like good child behaved best possible manner abandoned first lover lover poor unfitted soon told found second lover rich proper every way desirable 
regards clara countess felt safe give due satisfied matter rest 
sought interview fitzgerald 
come advice gone meet prompted necessity supporting daughter without views 
found alone looked face saw handsome noble good good inherent manliness bravery could long feud might able welcome friend 
would give frantic passion futile wicked senseless attempt make wretched insane marriage would sweet make effort rescue evil ways fallen owen would make response feeling 
clara desmond love would consent yield one 
truth certain degree mad subject 
think young girl given promise said word two called promise right bride belonged indefeasible property heart loveliness inexpressible tenderness young springing beauty subsequent renouncing part could fairly honestly deprive 
others oppose match intelligible hardly intelligible betray 
yet believe mainspring renouncing 
others countess castle richmond people frightened falseness therefore became maintain right means almost means within power 
give free voice say herbert fitzgerald take consent go bride castle richmond stood smiled wished joy never rode away stern heart leaving standing something sternness heart also 
meantime clara sure rejected suitor well away place put bonnet walked 
wont time becoming almost creature habit shut old dreary barrack 
mother rarely went habitually performed journey ground hour day day 
still unless herbert fitzgerald 
present occasion saw mother left house 
passed drawing room door seeing ajar knew countess nothing say mother late interview unless mother aught say 
passed 
truth mother nothing say 
sitting alone head resting hand sternness heart cloud upon brow thinking daughter 
skill motherly care provided well clara saved daughter perils beset path young girl brought child put forth world portionless child best things world showered lap countess think daughter thinking life would alone absolutely alone huge frightful home without friend almost without acquaintance without one soul near could love would love 
put hand owen fitzgerald rejected 
regarded merely mother woman loved 
countess desmond began ask old wrinkled ugly fit dowager mind body name ground yes always ground 
lady clara never varied walk 
went front entrance court one great curve old ruined lodge opened road running kanturk cork 
row elm trees stood walked hot eager lover beside docile horse followed behind feet 
walked daily possible walk without thinking always little well worn path road side road took measured exercise went along saw moist earth fresh prints horse hoofs 
also ridden way choosing pass absolute spot words uttered thinking moment also thinking 
felt sure case 
knew brought foot traces made together 
love truly love hot eager deeply planted soul really true passion filled heart whole life must made marred done thing impressed image mind must wretched without much completely regarded future worldly happiness words asserting love love stern fact deep necessity recurred mind 
could really done giving another promised committed injustice would constantly brought conscience truth deceived betrayed deserted poor given rich lover riches thought forgot fact indeed never half realized mind justified separating reckless course living conduct must held justified let pledge nature might 
walked path thought nothing wickedness sins thought vows listened renewal vows necessary ear deaf 
heart deaf swore scores scores oaths time swore lowest corner depth conscience seemed charge falsehood 
hours thinking much oftener saw face owen face duty bound think dream vain told afraid owen therefore thought 
tone voice rang ears oftenest anger sternness tone first assurance love tone inexpressibly sweet listened spot walked slowly thinking 
look ever present eyes almost feared gaze hour ago form spirit countenance worn together well remembered day 
would think try think herbert virtues goodness 
loved well

thought excellences good son fondly sisters loved inimitable conduct hard trying times 
remembered also right every way love 
mother brother approved

every way fitting 
pecuniary considerations favourable thought heart sank low within breast 
true sold mother bidding remembrance owen poverty made true nothing else done might one thing rate clear fate duty repeated wish marry herbert 
thought rebellion mother ever occurred desirable possible 
would true loving wife wife heart soul 
nevertheless walking thus beneath trees could think owen fitzgerald 
mood gone twice house lodge back reached lodge third time making thus last journey solitary walks work measured 
exercise needful little task make prolong beyond necessary 
turning last time heard sound horse hoof coming fast along road looking gate saw herbert coming 
expected waited gate meet 
arranged go days castle richmond stay fortnight 
settled shortly visit made mr mollett junior place yet unsettled 
soon known sir thomas summoned mr prendergast london felt would well clara visit postponed 
herbert especially cautioned father time mollett visit tell mother anything occurred certain extent kept promise 
course necessary lady fitzgerald know mr prendergast coming house course impossible keep fact visit connected lamentable state husband health spirits 
indeed knew much without telling 
probable mr prendergast come visit pleasure 
whatever may weighs upon mind herbert said better talking man trusts 
somers said lady fitzgerald 
somers often near affairs life 
really think wise send mr prendergast 
know believe good man 
lady fitzgerald expressed satisfied satisfied could seeing husband would take confidence settled herbert ride desmond court explain clara visit better postponed 
herbert got horse gate gave one children lodge lead 
horse would follow clara said walked back together towards house 
could prevent mind running direction 
would fain thought owen thus hung upon herbert arm yet learned control thoughts 
horse followed lovingly dogs place always loved men women whole country round old young spoke sort love everybody admired 
passed brain hanging accepted lover arm listening soft sweet words 
oh yes much better said answering proposal put visit castle richmond 
sorry sir thomas ill 
mr prendergast doctor herbert explained mr prendergast doctor physician mind rather body 
regarding clara already one family told much told mother 
explained deep sorrow weighing father heart none knew anything save existence might misfortune coming sir thomas herbert could even guess nature everything would told mr prendergast 
sad said herbert 
sad sad said clara tears eyes 
poor gentleman wish could comfort 
hope may said herbert 
somers seems think mind partly affected misfortune whatever may improbably less serious anticipate weighs heavier would altogether well 
mother herbert oh yes also pitied 
sometimes moments seems dread terrible misfortune believe calm judgment thinks worst calamity state father health 
neither discussing matter mother clara thinking alone ever occur herbert might individually subject misfortune father brooded 
sir thomas spoken piteously called poor seemed grieve might happen taken son part father malady 
everything around melancholy therefore terms seemed special force 
think necessary warn clara bad days might store caution path love might yet made rough 
think met horseback asked soon question visit decided 
mr owen fitzgerald probably said clara 
went hence hour since 
owen fitzgerald repeated though tidings visit made exactly pleasant 
thought lady desmond even see 
visit herbert explain 
going tell first came began castle richmond 
seen oh yes saw 
mamma thought best 
yesterday wrote note show 
gave account interview possible making rate intelligible owen come thither claim heard rumor engagement cousin 
inexcusable part unpardonable said herbert speaking angry spot face energy usual 
said clara innocently 
felt unconsciously painful hear owen ill spoken lover would fain excuse could 
dearest think motives could object place painful position cause trouble vexation us 
know engaged oh yes knew least quite sure think said heard love think said quite believe forced much describe betrothed owen boldly claimed 
conduct unpardonable said herbert 
nay ungentleman like 
intruded well knew wanted done taking advantage words present circumstances force forget 
herbert blame 
blame 
tell honestly lay blame door 
age impossible know mind 
even promise much binding nature subsequent conduct mother remonstrance well age would released without taint falsehood 
knew well surprised forced way mother house mere object causing embarrassment 
marvellous well herbert fitzgerald could lay law subject clara conduct due due owen 
victor gained prize therefore easy acquit promised bride heap reproaches head rejected rival 
owen told wanted course satisfied answer 
intrude among happy people absurd aspirations absurd monstrous part suppose could marry clara desmond way herbert regarded matter 
exactly way clara looked 
force way 
said 
wrote ask would see mamma said thought better 
forcing way sense meant find gives annoyance shall tell think 
persecuted 
herbert quarrel make wretched 
think would kill 
shall help clara 
duty protect becomes necessary must father brother age speak consideration alone saved attack 
clara said nothing knew could speak feelings heart 
could plead injured owen loved given false could confess tribute man love could regarded offence 
said nothing walked silence leaning arm 
close house drew near lady desmond met door step 
dare say heard visitor morning said taking herbert hand affectionate motherly way smiling sweetness 
herbert said heard expressed opinion mr owen fitzgerald would acting far wisely remained home hap house 
yes perhaps certainly said lady desmond putting arm within future son walking back great hall 
would wiser would saved dear clara painful half hour would saved perhaps years sorrow 
foolish remember clara childhood remember 
dear herbert lords creation sometimes foolish even trifling things women hearts 
herbert still persisted owen conduct inexcusable ungentlemanlike softly flattered quiescence 
must forget said perhaps loved clara almost truly 
harm probable succeed winning clara away oh mean 
clara sake 
probably never see till wife 
event suppose take place remote period 
soon ever father health admit 
persuade clara merciful 
tell truth herbert think could persuade anything 
course must hurry much 
losing sad understand would allow feeling stand way half hour 
near know 
yes therefore saying would absurd quarrel mr owen fitzgerald 
sorry sorry 
know whole story occurred clara course understand duty time plain 
clara behaved admirably would foolish whole matter might forgotten 
far concerned think may forgotten 
coming repeated 
thought better show afraid therefore permitted 
conceived would objected oh said herbert 
well much afraid certainly said countess 
appeased left house promising rate would nothing might lead quarrel cousin owen 
clara still kept bonnet walked lodge encountered first earnest supplication early day named marriage
