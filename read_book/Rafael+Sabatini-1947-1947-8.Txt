loss monsieur said 
expressions monsieur allude seems monsieur must refresh memory 
marquis crossed legs swung sideways chair last directly faced de vilmorin 
spoke monsieur however mistaken may spoke eloquently eloquently almost seemed infamy deed act summary justice upon thieving fellow mabey whatever name may 
infamy precise word used 
retract word honor inform orders gamekeeper benet proceeded 
said de vilmorin deed infamous infamy modified rank however exalted person responsible 
rather aggravated 
ah said le marquis drew gold snuffbox pocket 
say deed infamous monsieur 
understand longer convinced appeared infamy de vilmorin fine face wore look perplexity 
understand drift 
occurs le marquis view readiness assume responsibility must believe justification deed apparent

le marquis slight play eyebrows vague indulgent smile 
dark liquid eyes looked squarely face de vilmorin 
deceived fear 
deceived sentiments betray indiscretion madame mother must guilty 
brutally affronting words sped beyond recall lips uttered coldly merest commonplace remained calm faintly sneering 
dead silence followed 
andre louis wits numbed 
stood aghast thought suspended time de vilmorin eyes continued fixed upon de la tour azyr searching meaning eluded 
quite suddenly understood vile affront 
blood leapt face fire blazed gentle eyes 
convulsive quiver shook 
inarticulate cry leaned forward open hand struck le marquis full hard upon sneering face

la tour azyr words move game chess calculated exasperate opponent counter move counter move left entirely mercy 
le marquis looked white save de vilmorin finger prints began slowly color face said nothing 
instead de chabrillane talking taking preconcerted part vile game 
realize monsieur done said coldly philippe 
realize course must inevitably follow 
de vilmorin realized nothing 
poor young man acted upon impulse upon instinct decency honor never counting consequences 
realized sinister invitation de chabrillane desired avoid consequences respect priestly vocation strictly forbade adjustments disputes de chabrillane clearly thrusting upon 
drew back 
let one affront wipe said dull voice 
balance still le marquis favor 
let content 
impossible 
chevalier lips came together tightly 
thereafter suavity firm 
blow struck monsieur 
think correct saying thing never happened le marquis life 
felt affronted ask satisfaction due one gentleman another 
action would seem confirm assumption found offensive 
account render immune consequences 
see de chabrillane part heap coals upon fire make quite sure victim escape 
desire immunity flashed back young seminarist stung fresh goad 
nobly born traditions class strong upon stronger far seminarist schooling humility 
owed honor killed rather avoid consequences thing done 
wear sword messieurs cried andre louis aghast 
easily amended

blow deliberately provoked raged andre louis 
recovered though haughty stare part recovery 
god talk vain one argue purpose formed come away philippe 
see trap de vilmorin cut short flung 
quiet andre 
le marquis entirely right 
le marquis right andre louis let arms fall helplessly 
man loved living men caught snare world insanity 
baring breast knife sake vague distorted sense honor due

since recognized could avail nothing strip came guard fully dressed two hectic spots cheek bones burning otherwise gray face 
de chabrillane leaning upon cane relinquished sword de vilmorin looked quiet interest 
facing side combatants stood andre louis palest four staring fevered eyes twisting untwisting clammy hands 
every instinct fling antagonists protest frustrate meeting 
sane impulse curbed however consciousness futility 
calm clung conviction issue could really serious 
obligations philippe honor compelled cross swords man struck de la tour azyr birth compelled less serious hurt unfledged lad grievously provoked 
le marquis man honor 
could intend administer lesson sharp perhaps one opponent must live profit 
andre louis clung obstinately comfort 
steel beat steel men engaged 
marquis presented opponent narrow edge upright body knees slightly flexed converted living springs whilst de vilmorin stood squarely full target knees wooden 
honour spirit fair play alike cried match

also remembered chabrillane gone confidently meeting conceiving practiced ferailleur deal bourgeois utterly unskilled swordsmanship 
morally little better murderer tumbled pit conceived dug andre louis poetic retribution 
yet notwithstanding find cynical note andre louis announced issue assembly utterly detestable believe sincere 
would justify aline expressed opinion held common many others come close contact andre louis quite heartless 
seen something heartlessness conduct discovered faithlessness la binet although belied measures took avenge 
subsequent contempt woman account born affection time held 
affection deep first imagined believe shallow would almost pains make appear completeness affects put mind discovered worthlessness believe said actions encourage belief 
callous cynicism hoping killed binet also affectation 
knowing things binet better world suffered compunction must remember rarely level vision sees things proportions never either magnifies reduces sentimental considerations
