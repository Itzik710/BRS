yet difficulties still remained encounter exists investigating magistrate accused supreme tribunal admirable institution guarantee powerful moderator jury 
jury thank heaven content moral conviction 
strongest probabilities induce give affirmative verdict 
placed upon neutral ground prosecution defense demands material tangible proofs 
magistrate would condemn twenty times one security conscience jury acquit lack satisfying evidence 
deplorable execution lesurques certainly assured impunity many criminals necessary say justifies hesitation receiving circumstantial evidence capital crimes 
short save criminal taken act confesses guilt certain minister justice secure conviction 
sometimes judge inquiry anxious accused

uncertainty explains character passion often perceptible criminal trials

terrible struggle enough make one tremble responsibility magistrate remembers man imprisoned without consolation advice may innocent 
hard judge resist moral convictions even presumptive evidence points clearly criminal common sense recognizes justice times compelled acknowledge defeat lack jury consider sufficient proof guilt

fifteen centuries spotless fame end infamy 
daburon considered count de commarin conduct unpardonable determined spare 
expected meet proud haughty noble almost unmanageable resolved humble arrogance

terrible doubts albert occurred 
really father understand punishment thought perhaps sacrificed son child utter stranger 
thought made hate bastard called commarin 
great affection succeeded unconquerable aversion 
often days struggled insane desire kill since learned subdue aversion never completely mastered 
albert sir best sons 
nevertheless always icy barrier us unable explain 
often point appealing tribunals avowing reclaiming legitimate heir regard rank prevented 
recoiled scandal 
feared ridicule disgrace would attach name yet able save infamy 
old nobleman remained silent pronouncing words

witness guard longer witness depended upon trembles fear compromising measures weight questions hesitates answers 
hand justice form magistrate disposed doubt everything imagine everything suspect everybody 
far count stranger crime la jonchere although doubting albert paternity would certainly made great efforts save 
story showed thought honor peril much son 
man suppress every means inconvenient witness thus reasoned daburon 
yet could clearly see count de commarin interests concerned matter 
uncertainty made uneasy 
sir asked sternly informed discovery secret last evening albert 
spoke sad story way seek vain explain unless count stopped short reason struck improbability supposition formed 
unless inquired magistrate eagerly 
sir said count without replying directly albert hero guilty 
ah said magistrate quickly reason think innocent daburon spite plainly visible tone words de commarin could ought seen semblance insult 
started evidently offended rising said witness moment ago witness 
desire render assistance justice accordance duty 
confound said daburon offended way things making mistake mistake facts resumed count 
yesterday spoken cursed letters albert began set trap discover truth still doubts noel gerdy obtained complete correspondence 
animated discussion arose us 
declared resolution give way noel 
hand resolved compromise matter cost might 
albert dared oppose 
efforts convert views useless 
vainly tried touch chords breast supposed sensitive 
firmly repeated intention retire spite declaring satisfied would consent allow modest competence 
attempted shake showing marriage ardently looked forward two years would broken blow 
replied felt sure constancy betrothed mademoiselle arlange 
name fell like thunderbolt upon ears investigating magistrate 
jumped chair 
feeling face turning crimson took large bundle papers table hide emotion raised face though trying decipher illegible word 
began understand difficult duty charged 
knew troubled like child neither usual calmness foresight 
felt might commit serious blunders 
undertaken investigation could preserve quite free bias think would perfectly impartial gladly would put another time examination count could conscience told would another blunder 
renewed painful examination 
sir said sentiments expressed viscount fine without doubt mention widow lerouge yes replied count appeared suddenly brighten remembrance unnoticed circumstances yes certainly 
must shown woman testimony rendered struggle gerdy impossible 
precisely sir aside question duty upon based refusal follow wishes 
necessary count repeat exactly passed viscount 
appeal beseech memory try repeat words nearly possible 
de commarin could without much difficulty 
little time salutary reaction taken place within 
blood excited persistence examination moved accustomed course

discussion count plank safety 
committed nothing gained time 
would course raise objections since would end binding firmly father heart 
could thus make merit compliance would ask reward weakness 
noel returned charge would find presence count would boldly deny everything politely refuse anything would possibly driven house impostor forger 
strange coincidence yet easily explained de commarin telling story arrived ideas magistrate conclusions almost identical 
fact persistence respect claudine remembered plainly anger said son mankind habit fine actions satisfaction 
great disinterestedness explained 
count ceased speaking daburon said thank sir 
say nothing positive justice weighty reasons believe scene related viscount albert played part previously arranged

two father son stood face face apparently deep thought reality examining one another mutual distrust striving gather something thoughts 
daburon augured better results meeting awaiting ever since count arrival 
expected abrupt presentation would bring intensely pathetic scene would give two witnesses time reflection 
count would open arms noel would throw reconciliation would await sanction tribunals complete 
coldness one embarrassment disconcerted plans 
therefore thought necessary intervene 
count said reproachfully remember minutes ago admitted gerdy legitimate son 
de commarin made reply judge lack emotion could heard
