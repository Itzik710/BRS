sabatini smiled tolerantly 
dear fellow said reasonable reach age find silence often best 
matter fact ease sympathies much involved 
mind many hold strings revolution take place shall lead 
arnold bewildered 
protested ancient nobility europe 
place among crowd anarchists revolutionaries jump conclusions young friend remarked sabatini 
country spoken country country unjust decree exiled 
among desire change government many aristocrats 
democracy whose hatred aroused selfish brutal methods reigning house 
arnold got table walked window 
telephone rang insignificant inquiry customer 
incident somehow relieved 
brought back world every day events 
reality life obtruded upon conscience

police without doubt possession document curiously enough starling milan day 
perceive therefore absence even reasonable alibi might difficult prove innocence 
surprise however faith fellow instead taking matter indifference brave man chosen behave like child 
present half maudlin state would afraid serious danger conviction make statements likely cause good deal inconvenience sister friends others 
know committed murder arnold asked 
sabatini smiled 
perfectly well admitted fact helps little 
isaac lalonde rather notable figure among european criminals 
belongs company anarchists well meaning bloodthirsty hold one another death 
starling save disclose name real murderer would simply make exit life knife heart instead hangman rope neck 
fellows believe seldom commit crimes much earnest dangerous 
ever happen meet one red signet ring upon fourth finger look trouble 
arnold shivered moment

night rosario different 
track without doubt meant mischief 
since however pronounced difference opinion two branches revolutionary party one represent one includes lalonde friends 
consequence although may said working ends drawn little apart 
communications whatever lalonde friends since murder rosario 
therefore repeat entirely dark man sister rooms met death 
must remember fellows less criminals 
lalonde believe something exception rest war society extent enriching expense wealthier neighbors every possible occasion 
quite likely night watching rosario may occurred sister room contained good many valuable trifles easily entered especially seem meeting place close hand

drew sofa window sitting room looked downward 
somehow depression struggled evening seemed intensified saw 
early autumn stripped bare leaves scanty trees sky gray starless 
even lights along river front seemed burn dull uninspiring fire 
looked around depression became almost overmastering sensation

heart beginning beat fiercely 
looking across room straining eyes 
possible clothes health could make great difference standing upon threshold room 
coming slowly towards leaning ever slightly upon stick 
cheeks touched pink eyes lit soft wonderful brilliance shone like stars 
forgot fashionable hat quiet elegance clothes 
ruth came towards ruth radiantly beautiful transformed yet ruth held arms little sob glided 
side side took accustomed places upon horse hair sofa 
head sank upon shoulder hands clasped eyes wet tears 
siren blew river 
little tug two barges lashed alongside coming valiantly along 
dark coil water seemed suddenly agleam quivering lights
