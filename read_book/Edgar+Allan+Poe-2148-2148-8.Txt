difficulty asked 
nothing assassination way hope oh nothing nature 
fact business simple indeed make doubt manage sufficiently well thought dupin would like hear details excessively odd 
simple odd said dupin 
yes exactly either 
fact good deal puzzled affair simple yet baffles us altogether 
perhaps simplicity thing puts fault said friend 
nonsense talk replied prefect laughing heartily 
perhaps mystery little plain said dupin 
oh good heavens ever heard idea little self evident 
ha ha ha ha ha ha ho ho ho roared visiter profoundly amused oh dupin death yet matter hand asked

known asked dupin 
clearly inferred replied prefect nature document non appearance certain results would arise passing robber possession say employing must design end employ 
little explicit said 
well may venture far say paper gives holder certain power certain quarter power immensely valuable 
prefect fond cant diplomacy 
still quite understand said dupin 
well disclosure document third person shall nameless would bring question honor personage exalted station fact gives holder document ascendancy illustrious personage whose honor peace jeopardized 
ascendancy interposed would depend upon robber knowledge loser knowledge robber 
would dare thief said g minister dares things unbecoming well becoming man 
method theft less ingenious bold 
document question letter frank received personage robbed alone royal boudoir 
perusal suddenly interrupted entrance exalted personage especially wish conceal 
hurried vain endeavor thrust drawer forced place open upon table 
address however uppermost contents thus unexposed letter escaped notice 
juncture enters minister 
lynx eye immediately perceives paper recognizes handwriting address observes confusion personage addressed fathoms secret 
business transactions hurried ordinary manner produces letter somewhat similar one question opens pretends read places close juxtaposition 
converses fifteen minutes upon public affairs 
length taking leave takes also table letter claim 
rightful owner saw course dared call attention act presence third personage stood elbow 
minister decamped leaving letter one importance upon table 
said dupin precisely demand make ascendancy complete robber knowledge loser knowledge robber 
yes replied prefect power thus attained months past wielded political purposes dangerous extent 
personage robbed thoroughly convinced every day necessity reclaiming letter 
course done openly 
fine driven despair committed matter 
said dupin amid perfect whirlwind smoke sagacious agent could suppose desired even imagined 
flatter replied prefect possible opinion may entertained 
clear said observe letter still possession minister since possession employment letter bestows power 
employment power departs 
true said g upon conviction proceeded 
first care make thorough search minister hotel chief embarrassment lay necessity searching without knowledge 
beyond things warned danger would result giving reason suspect design 
said quite au fait investigations 
parisian police done thing often 
yes reason despair

frequently absent home night 
servants means numerous 
sleep distance master apartment chiefly neapolitans readily made drunk 
keys know open chamber cabinet paris 
three months night passed greater part engaged personally ransacking hotel 
honor interested mention great secret reward enormous 
abandon search become fully satisfied thief astute man 
fancy investigated every nook corner premises possible paper concealed 
possible suggested although letter may possession minister unquestionably may concealed elsewhere upon premises barely possible said dupin 
present peculiar condition affairs court especially intrigues known involved would render instant availability document susceptibility produced moment notice point nearly equal importance possession 
susceptibility produced said say destroyed said dupin 
true observed paper clearly upon premises 
upon person minister may consider question 
entirely said prefect 
twice waylaid footpads person rigorously searched inspection 
might spared trouble said dupin 
presume altogether fool must anticipated waylayings matter course 
altogether fool said g poet take one remove fool 
true said dupin long thoughtful whiff meerschaum although guilty certain doggrel 
suppose detail said particulars search 
fact took time searched every 
long experience affairs 
took entire building room room devoting nights whole week 
examined first furniture apartment 
opened every possible drawer presume know properly trained police agent thing secret drawer impossible 
man dolt permits secret drawer escape search kind 
thing plain 
certain amount bulk space accounted every cabinet 
accurate rules 
fiftieth part line could escape us

sometimes top table similarly arranged piece furniture removed person wishing conceal article leg excavated article deposited within cavity top replaced 
bottoms tops bedposts employed way 
could cavity detected sounding asked 
means article deposited sufficient wadding cotton placed around 
besides case obliged proceed without noise

take pieces chairs certainly better examined rungs every chair hotel indeed jointings every description furniture aid powerful microscope

two houses adjoining exclaimed must great deal trouble 
reward offered prodigious include grounds houses grounds paved brick 
gave us comparatively little trouble 
examined moss bricks found undisturbed 
looked among papers course books library certainly opened every package parcel opened every book turned every leaf volume contenting mere shake according fashion police officers 
also measured thickness every book cover accurate admeasurement applied jealous scrutiny microscope 
bindings recently meddled would utterly impossible fact escaped observation 
five six volumes hands binder carefully probed longitudinally needles 
explored floors beneath carpets beyond doubt 
removed every carpet examined boards microscope 
paper walls yes 
looked cellars 
said making miscalculation letter upon premises suppose 
fear right said prefect 
dupin would advise make thorough search premises 
absolutely needless replied g 
sure breathe letter hotel 
better advice give said dupin 
course accurate description letter oh yes prefect producing memorandum book proceeded read aloud minute account internal especially external appearance missing document 
soon finishing perusal description took departure entirely depressed spirits ever known good gentleman 
month afterwards paid us another visit found us occupied nearly 
took pipe chair entered ordinary conversation 
length said well g purloined letter presume last made mind thing overreaching minister confound say yes made examination however dupin suggested labor lost knew would 
much reward offered say asked dupin 
great deal liberal reward like say much precisely one thing say mind giving individual check fifty thousand francs one could obtain letter 
fact becoming importance every day reward lately doubled 
trebled however could done 
yes said dupin drawlingly whiffs meerschaum really think g exerted utmost matter 
might little think eh way puff puff might puff puff employ counsel matter eh puff puff puff 
remember story tell abernethy hang abernethy sure hang welcome 
upon time certain rich miser conceived design spunging upon abernethy medical opinion 
getting purpose ordinary conversation private company insinuated case physician imaginary individual 
suppose said miser symptoms doctor would directed take take said abernethy take advice sure 
said prefect little discomposed perfectly willing take advice pay 
would really give fifty thousand francs one would aid matter 
case replied dupin opening drawer producing check book may well fill check amount mentioned 
signed hand letter 
astounded 
prefect appeared absolutely thunder stricken 
minutes remained speechless motionless looking incredulously friend open mouth eyes seemed starting sockets apparently recovering measure seized pen several pauses vacant stares finally filled signed check fifty thousand francs handed across table dupin 
latter examined carefully deposited pocket book unlocking escritoire took thence letter gave prefect 
functionary grasped perfect agony joy opened trembling hand cast rapid glance contents scrambling struggling door rushed length unceremoniously room house without uttered syllable since dupin requested fill check 
gone friend entered explanations 
parisian police said exceedingly able way 
persevering ingenious cunning thoroughly versed knowledge duties seem chiefly demand 
thus g detailed us made searching premises hotel felt entire confidence made satisfactory investigation far labors extended 
far labors extended said yes said dupin 
measures adopted best kind carried absolute perfection 
letter deposited within range search fellows would beyond question found 
merely laughed seemed quite serious said 
measures continued good kind well executed defect lay inapplicable case man 
certain set highly ingenious resources prefect sort procrustean bed forcibly adapts designs 
perpetually errs deep shallow matter hand many schoolboy better reasoner 
knew one eight years age whose success guessing game even odd attracted universal admiration 
game simple played marbles 
one player holds hand number toys demands another whether number even odd 
guess right guesser wins one wrong loses one 
boy allude marbles school 
course principle guessing lay mere observation admeasurement astuteness opponents 
example arrant simpleton opponent holding closed hand asks even odd schoolboy replies odd loses upon second trial wins says simpleton even upon first trial amount cunning sufficient make odd upon second therefore guess odd guesses odd wins 
simpleton degree first would reasoned thus fellow finds first instance guessed odd second propose upon first impulse simple variation even odd first simpleton second thought suggest simple variation finally decide upon putting even 
therefore guess even guesses even wins 
mode reasoning schoolboy fellows termed lucky last analysis merely said identification reasoner intellect opponent 
said dupin upon inquiring boy means effected thorough identification success consisted received answer follows wish find wise stupid good wicked one thoughts moment fashion expression face accurately possible accordance expression wait see thoughts sentiments arise mind heart match correspond expression 
response schoolboy lies bottom spurious profundity attributed rochefoucault la bougive machiavelli campanella 
identification said reasoner intellect opponent depends understand aright upon accuracy opponent intellect admeasured 
practical value depends upon replied dupin prefect cohort fail frequently first default identification secondly ill admeasurement rather non admeasurement intellect engaged

understand meant suggesting purloined letter hidden within limits prefect examination words principle concealment comprehended within principles prefect discovery would matter altogether beyond question 
functionary however thoroughly mystified remote source defeat lies supposition minister fool acquired renown poet

mathematician poet 
mistaken know well 
poet mathematician would reason well mere mathematician could reasoned thus would mercy prefect 
surprise said opinions contradicted voice world 
mean set naught well digested idea centuries 
mathematical reason long regarded reason par excellence 
il pari r replied dupin quoting chamfort que toute id e publique toute convention ue est une sottise car elle convenue au plus grand nombre 
mathematicians grant done best promulgate popular error allude none less error promulgation truth 
art worthy better cause example insinuated term analysis application algebra 
french originators particular deception term importance words derive value applicability analysis conveys algebra much latin ambitus implies ambition religio religion homines honesti set honorablemen 
quarrel hand see said algebraists paris proceed 
dispute availability thus value reason cultivated especial form abstractly logical 
dispute particular reason educed mathematical study 
mathematics science form quantity mathematical reasoning merely logic applied observation upon form quantity 
great error lies supposing even truths called pure algebra abstract general truths 
error egregious confounded universality received 
mathematical axioms axioms general truth

latter science usually untrue aggregated parts equal whole 
chemistry also axiom fails 
consideration motive fails two motives given value necessarily value united equal sum values apart 
numerous mathematical truths truths within limits relation 
mathematician argues finite truths habit absolutely general applicability world indeed imagines 
bryant learned mythology mentions analogous source error says although pagan fables believed yet forget continually make inferences existing realities 
algebraists however pagans pagan fables believed inferences made much lapse memory unaccountable addling brains
