madame de looked meaningly peter ivanovitch spectacles convey conviction young man merit 
even nodded least bit direction razumov heard murmur breath words later diplomatic service could refer favourable impression made 
fantastic absurdity revolted seemed outrage ruined hopes vision mock career 
peter ivanovitch impassive though deaf drank tea 
razumov felt must say something 
yes began deliberately uttering meditated opinion 
clearly 
even planning purely military revolution temper people taken account 
understood perfectly 
discontent spiritualized 
ordinary heads revolutionary committees understand 
capable
