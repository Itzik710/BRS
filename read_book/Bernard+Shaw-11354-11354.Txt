lord carbury clever scientist conolly looked grave enough suggest question altogether discreet one 
brushing consideration replied seen great deal read great deal 
see great means disposal 
property good joint stock company back 
practically good considering method working good considering means disposal 
would means conolly made gesture plainly signified thought could great many things 
science expensive thought beyond reach money 
oh yes science may 
scientific man inventor 
two things quite different 
invention expensive thing world 
takes end time end money 
time money costs ways 
dont discover something make fortune already discovered something 
oh costs fortune make experiments enough lead invention 
exaggerating mean fortune case least four five hundred pounds 
surely would difficulty getting five hundred pounds 
conolly laughed

five hundred pounds mere nothing considering importance object 
really ought allow consideration delay career 
known people spend much one day worthless things 
something miss lind 
would recommend begin first said marian determination make mind spend money 
banish scruples largeness sum

certainly sholto 
say coming soon long absence probably surprise 
contemplation departure prevented broaching circumstances happily since lost significance 
tell communication reference marian perhaps guess nature 
indeed said mr lind affecting surprise 
well sholto heartiest approval 
know lonely life marriage entail expect consent without regrets 
could desire better settlement 
must leave day 
right complain 
shall far asunder hope marian nature form many ties break none 
amiable girl darling child 
know anything express request remains pleasure getting final consent would press armed sanction 
except involuntary hitch eyelids mr lind looked believed perfectly douglas respect parental claims 
quite right said quite right 
best wishes 
doubt succeed none 
course affairs settled contingencies provided children accidents forth 
difficulty likely arise us score still things arranged 
propose simple method arranging 
man honor conversant business give instructions

said like gentleman douglas sholto 
must consider giving answer 
thrown upon duty studying position well marian must neither abuse generosity neglect interest

fourth son younger son little left 
treat marian liberally fear anything bear comparison munificence 
surely give enough 
prefer solely responsible welfare 
oh

hitherto doubt aware mr douglas steam kept electricity motive power field much less expensive 
even induced magnetic currents cheapest known form electric energy obtained use steam power 
generate steam combustion coal electricity without steam generated combustion metals 
coal much cheaper metal consider vast amount coal consumed smelting metals 
still electricity much greater force steam stronger speak 
sixpennorth electricity would work sixpennorth steam could catch hold without waste 
present waste enormous electric engines compared steam engines steam held spite inferior strength 
invented put shortly electric engine hardly waste pump water turn mill stones draw railway trains lift elevators saving fuel labor nearly seventy per cent cost steam 
added conolly glancing douglas motor six horsepower made weigh less thirty pounds including fuel flying perfectly feasible 
said douglas incredulously 
trustworthy evidence prove flying dream combination great power little weight eagle instance possesses could formerly realized machine 
lightest known four horse power steam engine weighs nearly fifty pounds 
motor machine weighing thirty pounds give rather six horse power words produce wing power competent overcome much gravity 
aeronautical society within next years make machine capable carrying passengers air new york less two days make one 
wonderful indeed said douglas politely looking askance 
wonderful flight sparrow assure

mechanical contrivances seem serve us really mastering us crowding crushing beauty lives making commerce god 
certainly admit coarser forms radicalism made alarming strides influence modern civilization 
convenience steam conveyance remarkable doubt could dispense 
consistent liberal moderate liberal care advocate retrogression even direction ancient greece 
douglas seized certain impatience mr lind well mannered man never learned anything forgotten taught

point five hundred year belongs still makes quite independent

yet temper rather rose fell 
much serious hostility tone said seem thoroughly prepared happened 
want instructions shall write marian money affairs want know case takes head come back found fool made whether may tell glad rid use humiliating coming door turned away 
shall explain situation point view said 
sound voice looked alarm 
indulgent half playful manner almost lost sense invariable speaking ladies suddenly gone 
felt real man coming without ceremony 
quick perceive effect produced 
soften placed comfortable chair hearthrug said ordinary friendly way sit nearer fire talk comfortably 
continued standing back mantelpiece let tell miss mcquinch talk turning people away door talking fair square sense 
dont turn acquaintances way much less friends woman lived wife eighteen months must always rather particular friend 
liked husband shall continue like longer husband 
need fear score 
wont remain husband 
said knew going happen intended happen wanted happen glad happened 
truth thought said 
time past marian staying matter custom convenience using cover philandering douglas paying keeping house nicely 
asked twice long last 
hurry answer although wifeless one live really cared quite prepared wait couple years necessary chance making somehow 
sooner later insisted closing accounts parting sorry end come since inevitable though right sorry way come 
instead eloping conventional way come understanding 
could easily taken trip states could stopped months south dakota got divorced without scandal 
never made claims since found didnt care might known man keep play dog manger fellow like douglas 
however thats past praying 
enough enough set family except like remain good friends 
one whole lot worth salt 
understood course take marian part issues friends far consistent right said nelly shortly 
shake hands tell something else help understand better said holding hand 
gave bargain struck turned fire seated edge table 
know married resumed promoted mix fashionable society first time 
course whole excitement affair family 
know impression made polite society better probably 
tell know impression polite society made dont understand 
perhaps never occurred even sharp could taken society otherwise valuation something much higher cultivated refined anything accustomed 
well never believed much time made mesalliance marian sake realized infinitely beneath class one married 
mesalliance marian take back shake hands 
mesalliance class sake made distinction purposely 
miss mcquinch worker 
belonged belong class keeps world millions serviceable hands serviceable brains 
pride caste settles point 
admit loafer equal 
man working bench equal whether day work provided best 
man work anyhow class work class mine 
annoyed marian refusing wear tall hat cuffs wanted seen walked piccadilly st james street belong people walk poor street dressed shew dont belong 
man like uncle marian father like marmaduke douglas loafing idly round spending money made sweat men like little better thieves 
get queerest makeshifts self respect old mr lind family pride 
douglas personal vanity marmaduke sort interest appetites jollity 
everything sham drill etiquet instead manners fashions instead tastes small talk instead intercourse 
everything special distinguished workers sham get real element good bad find something common civilized mankind 
reason isnt clear workmen come among workmen share ignorance things affect superiority 
poor jackson call yankee cad cad proper place among engineers works believes sham refinements sees around homes fond 
art trained ear music fine diction trained eye pictures colors buildings cultivated sense dignified movement gesture manner 
knows fashionable london listens looks talks behaves makes standard sets different vulgar 
difference got artistic training accident young natural turn profit 
ever saw west end londoner knew beautiful ugly rare common music speech costume gesture father operatic theatrical companies come among crowd thirdraters dancer actor scenepainter singer bandsman conductor fine artist 
consequently taken like jackson made faces trashy pictures drawling lounging strutting tailoring drawing room singing drawing room dancing bad ventilation unwholesome hours food mention polite dram drinking round cruelties call sport 
found moment refused accept habits rich standards refinement propriety whole illusion superiority vanished 
married marian false class 
sort idea early training accustomed degree artistic culture could easily find working girl would quite natural marian 
soon found keenest sense ladylike sense beautiful 
drawing photograph engraving sensibly framed without white mount round spoil pained much wrists without cuffs 
mill girl could less sympathy points preferred mill girls 
end felt love made thoroughly vulgar thing marry beneath 
aristocratic idle gentlemen never shamed laziness low mindedness democratic working gentlemen refuse associate instead running licking boots 
heartily glad set rid instead receive civilly house marian sake 
whole business strangling strain keeping feeling imagine 
know times carried away idea must tired artificiality life begun speak mind frankly recoiled hurt surprised frightened going turn coarse last shut sat apparently silent really saying breath dont go dont leave vanish fly away people must dream never married 
dont know cant wife lungs made breathe air live 
said thousand things like wondered whether truth telepathy whether could possibly thoughts transferred mind thinking imagination 
would ask whether despised calling truth believe excuses made fondness could get 
fond still sometimes 
really practically mean despise gave thinking 
certain kind contempt indifference beyond doubt use denying 
besides proved new respect feel courage grit try going away douglas 
love nothing short born thing sometimes happens ever bring contact 
put philosophically made mistake avoiding realities yet marrying hardest realities working man inevitable go back last region shadows mate ghostliest unrealities non working man 
perhaps union may fruitful cross us violent 
whole story point view 
hush said elinor interrupting 
noise outside house bell began ring violently could hear confused noise voices footsteps without 
come back said elinor starting 
impossible said conolly looking disturbed first time 
stood moment listening averted eyes 
second peal bell followed roars laughter amid remonstrant voice audible 
house door hammered stick 
conolly ran downstairs opened 
step found marmaduke reeling arms rev george 
ol fler said marmaduke plunging hall 
parson tight 
found tumbling high street brought along
