specially respect wears heart upon sleeve daws peck carries crystal window bosom see work going within keep affair private gushes love friendship every chance acquaintance little love given always wary always silent belongings buttons suit close reserve never loosens 
respect one may gain hardly love 
natural us like know affairs friends natural also think like talk trust 
perhaps may said weakness gushing indiscreet babbler pleasanter live one self constrained reticent man iron whose conversation among intimate friends solely politics science literature subject equally outside privacies inner life 
sir thomas underwood hope readers also know intimately one able make known intimately 
speaking man sixty speaking also one never yet made close friend never unconscious slow degrees affection fallen kind intimacy another man justifies renders necessary mutual freedom intercourse affairs life 
yet possessed warm affections means misanthropic nature would truth given much able free jocund men 
lacked power way rather 
seemed weakness rather strength always silent always guarded always secret dark 
lamented acknowledged infirmity man grieves short sighted dull hearing age sixty taken efficient steps towards curing evil abandoned idea cure 
whether upon whole fortunate unfortunate life shall left reader judgment 
certainly happy 
suffered cruel disappointments disappointment crush spirit worse realized calamity 
actual misfortune lord mayor london man set heart upon place worked position within feet mansion house become alderman mayoralty immediate rotation suffer passed liverymen lost half fortune 
sir thomas underwood become solicitor general profession never risen higher rank assured emoluments legal offices 
quite trace meleager back egg explain son barrister moderate means put bar died leaving little nothing behind 
young barrister sister married officer army passed latter life distant countries husband called necessity living income profession gave 
chancery barrister mr underwood sir thomas done well living income made marrying thirty five going parliament forty five becoming solicitor general fifty ceasing hold much desired office four months appointment 
cessation however arising political causes disappointment man 
doubtless case man placed regret weakness party unable keep good things government hands recognize without remorse sorrow fact ministry attached must cease ministry nothing displacement gall pride create inner feeling almost insupportable mortification comes conviction personal failure 
sir thomas underwood solicitor general months conservative prime minister conservative minister went office sir thomas underwood followed feeling regret caused unhappiness 
afterwards party came back power lost election borough represented passed without word sympathy even assumed regret minister wounded 
true knew man solicitor general seat parliament 
highest legal offices country attained amount professional excellence unless candidate shall added excellence power supporting ministry party house commons 
sir thomas underwood thoroughly understood knew also various ways lame dog may helped stile lame dog popular among dogs 
another ex solicitor general seat would found delay would granted least would consultation suggestion something tried 
case man four years junior age despised informed obtained place parliament gross bribery put office without word apology 
unhappy acknowledged spirit crushed 
acknowledged time one doomed nature crushing spirit came hole solitude endeavored carry open fight life among fellow men 
knew one doomed disappointment bitterest comes failure prize reached 
much become solicitor general achieved worse nothing solicitor general four months find world around one regards one failed therefore fit shelf 
sir thomas underwood feelings sat alone chambers days new administration formed days neither consulted visited communicated either message letter 
formation ministry late solicitor general invited take part occurred seven years commencement story 
years lawyer sat parliament mr underwood time working hard also chancery barrister perhaps nearer fellow men ever ever destined afterwards resided regarded almost nominally small pretty villa taken wife sake fulham 
close upon river well arranged though extensive shrubbery walks little lawn tiny conservatory charming opening thames 
mrs underwood found unable live half moon street mr underwood unwillingly removed household gods retreat 
time household gods consisted wife two daughters wife died time came could taken name lady underwood 
villa fulham still kept lived two girls also sir thomas interrogated subject would declared also domiciled 
man lives place often sleeps sir thomas truth lived chambers southampton buildings 
moved household gods villa necessary duties parliament place town wherein might lay head therefore fear unwillingly took laying head frequently little bedroom attached chambers 
necessary go back feelings might operated upon wife lifetime period parliamentary career 
wife dead longer held seat parliament 
indeed abandoned practice bar never putting forward ordinary business chancery barrister 
nevertheless spent largest half life chambers breakfasting reading writing sleeping 
altogether desert lodge fulham two girls lived 
would even admit allow assert home 
sometimes two nights together sometimes three would villa never remaining however day 
sundays may almost said never home 
hence arose feeling went nearest create discord father daughters 
sir thomas always southampton buildings sundays 
sir thomas go church miss underwoods go church regularly thought much propriety necessity sunday exercises 
could remember younger days father always 
could remember indeed something sternness would require punctuality exactness duty 
perhaps four times year would go rolls chapel 
much could learn believed beyond sundays kept holy attendance divine service 
may said believed aright 
sir thomas chambers southampton buildings though dull dingy aspect outside reached staircase may designated lugubrious much dark dismantled condition tend melancholy large commodious 
bedroom small two spacious sitting rooms one fitted library dining room 
beyond clerk room sir thomas though given greater part business given clerk old man clerk passed entire time half past eight morning till ten night waiting upon employer various capacities sedulous personal attention probably intended devote first took upon duties clerk practising chancery barrister 
joseph stemm sir thomas unlike character grown old together equal step admit separation new alliance 
stemm one friend world sir thomas friend 
already said sir thomas friend perhaps felt true intimacy friendship produces stemm human 
sir thomas tall thin man stooped considerably though effect years face would perhaps almost mean rescued evil condition assurance intelligence strength always conveyed certain class ugliness 
nose something like great lord brougham thin long projecting point 
quick gray eyes good forehead component parts countenance irregular roughly put together 
chin long also upper lip may taken fact ugly man 
hale however strong still good walker thought nothing making way villa foot evening dining club 
custom dine club highly respectable comfortable club situated corner suffolk street pall mall senior two devoted well scions great universities 
sir thomas dined perhaps four nights week ten months year 
said club never known dine company another member club 
manner sat solitary meal always pint port table well known figure old king horseback outside street unlike ordinary manner men unlike ordinary figures kings 
always book hand club book novel mudie magazine ancient hard bound volume library brought pocket undivided attention would given 
eating dinner always consisted joint day nothing else take five minutes would sip port wine slowly would cup tea would also drink slowly would pocket book pay bill would go 
rarely case spoke one club 
would bow man addressed would answer conversation club knew nothing hardly ever went room dinner served 
conversing men would express wonder one ever risen high office indeed could thriven profession 
matters us apt form confident opinions apparent causes near surface guides character fallacious 
perhaps london better lawyer branch law sir thomas underwood 
worked great diligence though shy degree quite unintelligible men general ordinary intercourse life feeling diffidence upon legs court house commons 
lord chancellor wife daughters could exchange five words comfort lordship drawing room court lord chancellor another lawyer believed good lawyer 
man ever succeeded browbeating panoplied wig gown words ever wanting arrayed 
suggested attorney knew way attorneys ought know barristers stand certain borough stood returned 
thrice returned town last discovered would never dine leading townsmen call wives london assist little private views strength extreme respectability broken rejected 
meantime found value party attached 
discovered sound lawyer man great erudition studied experience history well wants present age 
one would disgrace government invited accept office solicitor general minister never seen house commons 
good lawyer england said lord chancellor 
always speaks uncommon clearness said chancellor exchequer 
never saw talking human said secretary treasury deprecating appointment 
soon get complaint assistance said minister laughing 
mr underwood became solicitor general sir thomas work doubt would returned office parliament party returned power 
made friend learned talk even secretary treasury party came back power passed without remorse almost without regret 
never resumed active bustle profession disappointment 
wife dead nearly twelvemonth went declaring attorneys others professional life done 
take certain class work came back old chambers southampton buildings seen court rarely understood wished supposed retired 
ever moderate man mode living put together sum money sufficient moderate wants 
possessed twelve fourteen hundred year independent anything might earn never man greedy money indifferent earlier days 
mistake think suppose men become greedy grow old 
avaricious man show avarice gets years avarice passion compatible old age become avaricious passions fall 
man open handed 
mr underwood struggling bar fought hard compeers comfort independence money money never dear trained philosopher disregarded altogether except far enabled maintain independence 
certain friday evening june sat dinner club instead applying book according custom taken pocket read letter soon read would restore envelope would take moments thought 
last cup tea done bill paid put away letter book together walked door club 
stood considered next evening 
past eight clock use four five perhaps six hours remained go bed temptation liable prompted return solitude southampton buildings 
would sleep till ten chair would read drink tea perhaps write till one would prowl purlieus chancery lane temple lincoln inn till two even three clock morning looking old dingy windows holding aid powers imagination gave long intercourse men among certain weakness physical organization enable live flesh 
well policemen knew roamed much speculated roamings 
night wanderings addressed word one one ever address word 
yet world perhaps alive period twenty four hours 
present occasion temptation resisted 
home whole week knew well ought give daughters countenance presence 
whether feeling alone would sufficient withdraw charms chancery lane send villa may doubted letter perused carefully knew must communicated girls 
niece mary bonner orphan would arrive england jamaica fortnight 
mother sir thomas sister time dead three years 
general bonner father died girl left orphan almost penniless near friend unless underwoods would befriend 
news general death reached sir thomas already made inquiry fate niece late father agents 
general means known absolutely nothing believing however confined pay officer 
told girl would southampton fortnight utterly destitute 
declared stood steps club would go home consult daughters mind fact made niece fate long got home turned pall mall st james park 
would sometimes talk consulting daughters truth rarely consulted human would leave undone 
went straight went straight without human light given intellect heart conscience 
took hour half reach home time four fifths occupied resolving would emergency deep grumblings regrets thing done 
new cares grievous 
nay old cares grievous new cares terrible 
though bold deciding timid looking forward results decision 
course orphan girl must taken house course must take upon duty father regard 
chapter ii 
popham villa 
popham villa name house fulham seen men passing painted conspicuously pillars gate led garden 
mr underwood first taken place wished expunge name feeling cockneyfied pretentious unalluring 
mrs underwood rather liked remained 
subject ridicule two girls never ventured urge withdrawal wife death sir thomas never alluded subject 
popham villa therefore words remained 
house unpretentious containing two sitting rooms besides small side closet could hardly called girls even mother lifetime claimed 
drawing room pretty room could opening lawn folding windows giving near view bright river flowed glimpse bridge 
dining room little closet ground floor rate many chambers family required 
girls desired better house father could 
would urge books london even willing move room popham villa 
sad enough two girls kind life 
worst perhaps never knew expect 
word said impracticability dinner ready gentleman gentleman would never say whether would want dinner 
unfortunate remark sir thomas taken advantage saying came would come dinner unless certified contrary beforehand 
dinner would come temptation returning chambers would go day day 
friday evening girls almost expected rarely let week pass without visiting still rarely came saturday 
found upon lawn rather brink river standing young man knew well 
kissed girls gave hand young man

sir thomas especially anxious alone daughters could tell guest go 
justified feeling anger presence though experience prick conscience matter 
wrong daughters visited young man absence fault lay absence rather young man coming girls receiving 
young man ward year two former times intimate house live daughters almost elder brother might done 
young ralph newton early life taken rooms london ceased ward latterly sir thomas understood lived life make unfit trusted companion two girls 
yet nothing mode living make necessary absolutely banished villa 
spent money fitting got debt sir thomas trouble affairs 
orphan nephew heir old country squire never saw 
money received father nearly spent rumored raised funds post obits uncle life 
things told hereafter sir thomas though given instruction subject averse even allude like think ralph newton villa girls absence 
girls good gold 
sure 
told would left constantly without care 
patience elder marvel among young women prudence conduct proper feeling clarissa certainly ever loved better two far knew faultless little passionate little warmer somewhat fond pleasure sister account loved 
nothing could would make safer would virtue 
still pleased think ralph newton often villa 
man sir thomas entrusted charge young man great expectations hardly wishes daughter fall love ward whether ward prudent imprudent manner life 
sir thomas hot tired walk little fuss getting soda water tea 
plain see things quite comfortable ralph newton last took departure catch earlier two trains mentioned 
nevertheless past ten went sir thomas sitting open window drawing room took letter 
patience said addressing elder daughter withdrew enclosure envelope mary bonner england fortnight 
shall spoke held letter manner justified girl taking hand 
allowed go read answered 
sad letter cold language still full pathos 
friends west indies friends advised proceed england 
given understand father affairs settled would left hundred pounds 
would uncle provide humble home present assist future endeavors obtain employment governess could thought teach music french would endeavor fit work tuition respects 
know said slight claim upon one never seen connected poor mother perhaps allow trouble far great distress

yes must come said sir thomas 
mean stay always 
yes stay always 
say arrangement one look forward satisfaction 
man undertake new duties without fears especially duty see end may probably quite unable perform 
papa sure nice said clarissa

hope interfere happiness 
sure said clarissa 
determine shall add best make happy said patience 
great risk must run said sir thomas matter settled 
explained intended go southampton receive niece would bring direct port new home 
patience offered accompany journey declined unnecessary 
everything decided eleven clock even room mary bonner occupy girls left father knowing well would go bed next four hours 
would sleep chair next two hours would wander read perhaps sit think added care till night would half 
two sisters go bed 
new arrangement important father certainly importance 
doubt would still occupy chambers would still live practically alone london though theory presiding genius household fulham must take new sister knew spite clarissa enthusiasm might new sister would one could love 
remember ever heard word said clarissa 
told pretty 
remember said patience 
old younger suppose clarissa underwood time one twenty patience nearly two years senior 
oh yes nineteen say 
think told four five older mary died 
strange terrible left alone last large family relation one ever seen poor dear girl wrote letter continued patience think must clever 
sure could written letter position said clarissa 
sat almost late father discussing probable character appearance new relation chance able love hearts 
necessity immediate small sacrifice difficulty 
hitherto two sisters occupied separate bedrooms one chamber must given stranger would necessary together 
sacrifices entail little pain pleasant feeling sacrificial devotion much atones consequences 
patience underwood elder taller two girls certainly pretty 
figure good hands feet small respects like lady possessed neither feminine loveliness comes often simply youth rarer beauty belongs face produced lines expression 
countenance thin might perhaps called dry hard 
like father without however father nose redeeming feature face found sense intelligence conveyed bright gray eyes 
long chin long upper lip exaggerated father countenance made notoriously plain man 
hair though plentiful long possess shining lustre love see girls recognize one sweetest graces girlhood 
outwardly patience underwood knew well one perfectly satisfied want personal attraction patience underwood 
never spoke subject even sister 
complain neither much common boast beauty 
sister loveliness dear would sometimes break enthusiastic words 
externally said nothing 
gifts another sort means willing think one unendowed gifts 
clever knew clever 
could read understood read 
saw difference right wrong believed saw clearly 
diffident certainly unhappy 
strong religious faith knew supplement sometimes failing happiness world trusting happiness next 
extreme anxiety reference father patience underwood would happy woman 
clarissa younger beauty 
fact beauty acknowledged knew well known 
fact never doubt since turned fifteen 
somewhat shorter sister less slender 
darker complexion hair rich color brown hair lustrous silky luxuriant 
wore indeed according fashion day chignon head beneath curls escaped forehead clipped short wavy impertinent also fashion day 
wore man could hardly wish otherwise 
eyes unlike father sister blue whole contor features nothing resembling 
upper lip short chin short dimpled 
dimple one cheek charm much maddening seen sides alike 
nose perfect grecian roman egyptian simply english retrouss 
said mouth thought wide teeth perfect class critics necessity cavil rather kiss 
added childishness manner though somewhat ashamed others enamoured 
childishness youthful years already reached mature age twenty one half doubting half pouting half yielding half obstinate soft loving lovable childishness gives exacts caresses genuine may exist age much beyond clarissa underwood reached 
charms clarissa happy girl sister 
lack inward satisfaction time two causes 
believed fool respect jealous sister believed love love almost without hope 
foolishness seemed fact admitted every one patience 
human came near seem imply question wisdom judgment erudition sister would farce 
patience could talk italian could read german knew least name every poet ever written always able say exactly ought done 
could make servants love yet obey could always dress allowance without owing shilling 
whereas clarissa obeyed one debt bootmaker milliner let struggles cause gallant might could understand word dante aware read faery queen exactly child performs lesson 
love sharper sorrow 
need reader told ralph newton hero late owner believed heart given sore subject never yet mentioned frankly even two sisters 
truth though patience thought fancy think much fancy 
far could see even fancy young man part 
word spoken could accepted expression avowed love 
least patience believed 
would unhappy otherwise ralph newton opinion man whose love sister could trusted confidence 
yet beyond father sister one patience loved ralph newton 
however little episode life clarissa underwood tended make sister uneasy reader may well hear 
second newton younger brother though younger orders possession living gregory newton rev gregory newton space weeks acquaintance fallen fury love clarissa course three months made many offers often refused 
happened winter spring previous opening story patience sir thomas well disposed towards young man suit 
committed sir thomas charge ralph brought care uncle whose heir ralph obligation legal settlements 
uncle quarrelled brother since dead heir nevertheless taken nephew hand bestowed upon young clergyman living newton 
gregory newton brought villa brother fallen knees beauty 
beauty would none gone back living hampshire broken hearted priest swain 
patience though never directly informed feared partiality unworthy ralph induced sister refuse offers brother certainly worthy 
thinking patience underwood lot life could happier woman wife zealous praiseworthy parson english country parish lot life least could happier woman intended become wife 
two girls popham villa told evening new sister brought home 
next morning came course still full subject

clarissa would ridicule old stemm face patience would allow beaten 
second visit make way father sanctum never knew whether truth called 
old stemm least mind lies tells clarissa said 
patience made reply feeling responsibility figments might perhaps lie exclusively old stemm shoulders 
dears way place sir thomas said soon girls made good entrance

chapter v mr neefit family 
mr neefit breeches maker conduit street repute hunting man could said go decently hunting field unless decorated garment made mr neefit establishment 
manipulation leather something marvellous latter years added original art art first perfect rather comprehensive exquisite skill cords buckskins like materials 
trade becoming prosperous thought degenerating tailor adding largely premises compensating pride prospects great increase fortune angel glory whispered let well alone still able boast measurements confined legs sportsmen 
instead extending business simply extended price boldly clapped extra half guinea every pair supplied 
experiment altogether successful heard riding men city mr neefit prices undoubtedly higher breeches maker london refused supply breeches grooms marquis marquis hunting man riding men city flocked numbers became quite common thing give orders june july might disappointed november came round 
mr neefit prosperous man troubles 
great trouble sporting men would slow paying breeches took pride mr neefit fortune rapid early life 
begun small capital small establishment even place business limited size 
clever enough make profit even smallness contrived understood little back room men measured diminutive suit special business welcome crowd 
pride said wait upon hunting men garments world large wished concern whatever 
outer shop looking conduit street long counter goods unrolled inspection artist solemnity whose brow whose rigid silence betokened nature great employment always cutting leather 
grave man german rumor among young sportsmen old neefit paid highly skilled operator year services nobody knew morsel leather would behave needle could come within two hairbreadths accuracy across kneepan 
measuring mr neefit almost always 
measured mr neefit essential perfection cut german 
rumors indeed certain classes customers mr neefit great foreigner kept personally aloof 
believed mr neefit would condescend measure retail tradesman 
latterly indeed arisen doubt whether would lay august hand stockbroker leg though little wallop one young glories capel court swears handled every year 
confound impudence says wallop like see sending foreman 
cutting think know bawwah name foreign artist exactly known pronounced written spelt fashion sporting gentlemen writing 
readers may told confidence late date mr neefit lived rooms shop 
certainly thing prosperous tradesman 
indeed tradesman known private residence hardly become prosperous 
neefit cautious man till two years commencement story actually lived conduit street working hard however keep residence deep secret customers large 
proud possessor villa residence hendon two miles country beyond swiss cottage customers knew never found 

pm said mr neefit troubles one great troubles young friend ralph newton 
ralph newton hunting man stud horses never less four sometimes running seven eight always standing moonbeam barnfield

engaging civil spoken young man whose order almost impossible decline 
known moreover prospects good nevertheless pleasant breeches maker see second hundred pound accumulating books leather breeches one gentleman 
em old neefit would say dare ask question mr newton 
tradesman complain gentleman consumes many articles 
things however went far mr neefit found incumbent make special inquiry prospects 
things gone far indeed ralph newton appeared one summer evening villa hendon absolutely asked breeches maker lend hundred pounds left taken tea mr mrs miss neefit lawn received almost promise loan forthcoming would call conduit street following morning 
early may ralph newton called though difficulties received money three days passed 
mr neefit stout little man bald head somewhat protrusive eyes whose manners customers contained combination dictatorial assurance subservience found efficacious peculiar business 
general subjects would rub hands bow head agree humbly every word uttered 
day would radical conservative devoted church scoffer parsons animated behalf staghounds loud censurer aught way hunting orthodox fox 
trivial outside subjects considered duty tradesman simply ingratiate matter breeches gave way man let custom might 
knew business going told man whether garments made fit 
duty gentleman come allow see still half embryo condition 
gentlemen duty sure could 
would take back anything approved without murmur must decline transactions 
moreover quite understood complain materials insult would condescend make civil reply 
elderly gentleman essex told buttons given breaking 
breeches washed old woman country said mr neefit slowly looking elderly gentleman face run mangle buttons break 
elderly gentleman never dared even enter shop 
mr neefit perhaps somewhat imperious matters relating business excuse must stated truth honest tradesman honest least far make breeches well knew 
made mind best way make fortune send good articles best 
whether honest adding additional half guinea price found men dealt fools enough attracted high price shall left advanced moralists decide 
universal agreement diverse opinions must fear something dishonesty 
made best breeches put shoddy cheap stitching upon whole honest tradesman 


mr neefit hours come understood knew establishment well half past twelve half past one master always absent

last yet ten days chapter xxvi 
moggs purity rights labour 
mr trigger hinted ontario moggs would thorn flesh mr westmacott supporters percycross right 
ontario timid hesitating unfrequently brow beaten social part work election 
though made great struggles could neither talk walk eat sit though equal colleague 
came politics political management holding 
would make speeches speeches held desirable committee loud upon topics thought allusion whatever made 
talk ballot first conceded moggs 
mr westmacott indeed opposed ballot matter course candidate people support measure 
ballot would safety valve 
moggs cross grained ill conditioned uncontrollable would let ballot suffice 
ballot almost nothing 
strikes bribery great subjects beauty one ugliness 
right labourer combine brother labourers make terms labor great lesson taught 
suicidal iniquity labourer selling political power use protect labor source burning indignation 
labor salt earth told men percycross often told often manliness courage necessary make salt productive 
gradually men percycross said boys percycross clustered round learned like listen 
came understand something character man almost shame faced speak dragged round homes canvas nothing could repress legs crowd 
vain managing agent told would get vote spouting shouting 
occasions hardly answered word managing agent 
spouting shouting went certainly popular among bootmakers tanners 
mr westmacott asked interfere mild fashion ontario replied called sphere action could duty according lights 
young men presidents secretaries chairmen awhile somewhat frightened assured managing men liberal committee election would lost furious insanity candidate 
decided upon supporting moggs found would deposed seats discarded 
last futile efforts control moggs maintained patience something week still wanted four five days election actual split made liberal camp 
moggs turned adrift westmacottian faction 
bills placarded town explaining cruel necessity action describing moggs revolutionary firebrand 
three parties town 
mr trigger rejoiced greatly mr griffenbottom 
cut throats wonder said 
even sir thomas caught something feeling triumph began almost hope might successful 
nevertheless number men could quite make minds duty required till day election considerable mr pile triumphantly whispered mr trigger ear conviction things going changed percycross quite easily people supposed 
moggs utterly discarded respectable leaders liberal party borough turned liberal inn head quarters party refused right participating liberal breakfasts dinners provided moggs felt triumphant martyr 
portmanteau hat box carried admiring throng cordwainers arms house indeed highest repute town separate committee formed 
mr westmacott best avert secession supporters inexorable 
liberal tradesmen percycross would nothing candidate declared inasmuch man mind worthy man money labor worthy capital therefore men dominate rule masters 
doctrine necessarily abominable every master tradesman 
men decide many hours would work recreation would fashion rate would paid proportion profit allowed members masters creators firm doctrine moggs preaching 
tradesmen percycross whether liberal conservative understand much world politics understand doctrine carried would take gehenna revolutionary desolation 
moggs banished northern star inn mr westmacott living forced set radical staff cordwainers arms 
one respect certainly gained much persecution 
record election doings would confined columns percycross herald carried candidature usual fashion doings blazoned london newspapers 
daily news reported gave article even times condescended make example bring evidence revolutionary doctrines distasteful electors country generally 
fame ontario moggs certainly became familiar ears world large would done continued run pair mr westmacott
