rome january 
months ago met old friend school fellow jozef sniatynski last years occupied prominent place among literary men 
discussion literature sniatynski spoke diaries 
said man leaves memoirs whether well badly written provided sincere renders service future psychologists writers giving faithful picture times likewise human documents relied upon 
seemed think likely novel future would take form diary finally asserted anybody keeps diary works common good meritorious thing 
thirty five remember ever done anything country reason maybe leaving university life slight intervals spent abroad 
fact lightly touched upon given spite scepticism many bitter pang therefore resolved follow friend advice 
indeed means work kind merit try use way 
intend perfectly sincere 
enter upon task mentioned reasons also idea pleases 
sniatynski says man gets accustomed put thoughts impressions becomes gradually one delightful occupations life 
prove contrary lord mercy diary would snap asunder like string tightly drawn 
ready much community bore sake oh could 
nevertheless resolved discouraged first difficulties shall give fair trial 
adopt style write literary point view says sniatynski 
easier said done 
fully understand greater writer less writes purely literary style dilettante command style 
know experience one thinks much feels deeply often seems put thoughts feelings order produce something altogether common yet soon sets work falls certain mannerism style common phraseology thoughts come spontaneously one might almost say mind directs pen pen leads mind common empty artificiality 
afraid wanting eloquence literary simplicity picturesqueness wanting good taste style might become distasteful thereby render task impossible 
shall see later 
begin diary short introductory autobiography 
name leon ploszowski said thirty five years age 
come wealthy family able preserve fortune 
shall increase time likely squander 
position necessity enter competition struggling humanity 
expensive ruinous pleasures sceptic knows much worth rather knows worth anything 
mother died week born 
father loved life became affected melancholia

forgot mention brought remains rome buried campo santo 
house babuino called casa osoria coat arms 
looks like museum anything else father possesses mean collections especially early christian times 
collections whole life absorbed 
young man brilliant appearance well mind wealth name added roads open consequently great things expected 
know fellow students berlin 
deeply absorbed study philosophy generally believed name would rank cieszkowski libelt others 
society favorite female circles diverted somewhat scientific studies 
society known nickname leon l invincible 
spite social success neglect philosophical researches everybody expected day would electrify world great work make name illustrious 
disappointed expectations 
beautiful appearance still remains day one finest noblest heads 
artists opinion long ago one remarked would difficult find perfect type patrician head 
scientific career father remains cultured gifted nobleman dilettante 
almost believe dilettantism fate ploszowskis refer later come write

quite convinced father intend published reason speculative philosophy failed even set aside world 
reason failure death mother 
father spite nickname leon l invincible reputation conqueror hearts man deep feelings simply worshipped mother put many terrible questions philosophy obtaining either answer comfort recognized utter emptiness presence great sorrow 
must awful tragedy life since almost shattered foundations brain heart 
mind became affected said recovered went back religious convictions 
told one time prayed night day knelt street passed church carried away religious fervor extent looked upon madman others saint 
evident found consolation philosophical triplicities gradually calmed began lead rational life 
heart power affection turned towards aesthetic bent found employment study early christianity 
lofty restless mind wanted nourishment 
first year rome took archaeology dint hard study acquired thorough knowledge antique 
father calvi first tutor time great judge roman antiquities gave final impulse towards investigation eternal city 
fifteen years ago father became acquainted subsequently terms friendship great rossi whose company spent whole days catacombs 
thanks extraordinary gifts soon acquired consummate knowledge rome astonish rossi 
several times began writing treatises subject never finished begun 
maybe completion collections took much time likely reason leave anything behind except collections confine one epoch specialty researches 
gradually mediaeval rome began fascinate much first era christianity 
time mind full orsinis colonnas approached renaissance fairly captivated 
inscriptions tombs first traces christian architecture passed nearer times byzantine paintings fiesole giotto artists fourteenth fifteenth centuries fell love statues pictures collections certainly increased great work polish three romes remained forever land unfulfilled intentions 
collections father singular idea 
wants bequeath rome condition placed separate gallery named museum osoria ploszowski 
course wishes respected 
wonder father believes useful community sending country 
long ago said perceive scarcely anybody would see derive benefit whereas whole world study every individual benefits thereby carries benefit communities 
befit analyze much family pride thought name engraved marble eternal city whole scheme 
almost think must case 
perfectly indifferent collections remain 
aunt bye shortly going pay visit warsaw indignant idea leaving collections country thought speech go always together expresses indignation every letter 
years ago rome wrangled every day matter would quarrelled outright affection towards subdued temper 
aunt older father several years 
father great sorrow left country gave ploszow estate took instead ready capital 
aunt managed property thirty years manages perfectly 
rather uncommon character therefore devote lines 
age twenty betrothed young man died exile aunt follow abroad 
time forth refused offers marriage remained old maid 
mother death went father vienna rome lived surrounding tenderest affections subsequently transferred 
full meaning word une grande dame somewhat autocrat haughty outspoken self possession wealth high position give withal essence goodness kindliness 
cover abrupt manners excellent lenient disposition loving family instance father household mankind general 
virtuous really know whether merit could otherwise tried 
charities proverbial 
orders poor people like constable tends like saint vincent de paul 
religious 
doubts whatever assail mind 
unshaken principles therefore never hesitates choice ways means 
therefore always peace happy 
warsaw call aunt account abrupt manners le bourreau bienfaisant 
people especially among women dislike generally speaking lives peace classes 
ploszow far warsaw aunt owns house spends winter 
every winter tries inveigle hope see married 
even received mysteriously worded missive adjuring come 
shall go seen time 
writes getting old wishes see dies 
confess always feel inclined go 
know aunt dearest wish see married therefore every visit brings cruel disappointment 
idea decisive step frightens 
begin new life tired old one finally another vexatious element relations aunt 
formerly father friends looked upon genius persists regarding one exceptionally gifted great things expected 
allow remain opinion seems abuse good faith tell nothing expected would likely conclusion time inflict upon dear old lady cruel blow 
misfortune many near share aunt opinion brings point drawing sketch character means easy task nature rather complicated one 
brought world sensitive nerves nerves perfected culture generations 
first years childhood remained care aunt departure according custom country nursery governess engaged 
lived rome among foreign surroundings father wished well grounded language engaged polish governess 
still us housekeeper babuino 
father also bestowed pains upon especially fifth year 
used go room talk developed mind prodigiously much perhaps age 
later studies archaeologic researches took whole time engaged tutor father calvi 
old man mind faith exceedingly serene 
loved art beyond everything 
believe religion even reacted upon beauty 
galleries old masters listening music sistine chapel lost altogether 
nothing pagan feelings based upon sybaritism sensual enjoyment 
father calvi loved art pure serene feeling maybe da fiesole cimabue giotto loved 
loved humility gifts way 
could say fine arts loved best believe leaned mostly towards harmony responded harmony mind 
whenever think father calvi reminded time old man stands beside raphael saint cecilia listening intently music spheres 
father priest sprang friendship lasted unto latter death 
confirmed father archaeologic researches especially rome 
another bond two love 
considered exceptionally gifted child god knows promising future 
strikes times formed kind harmony rounding completion world lived loved absorbing passion loved rome antiquities 
atmosphere surroundings could fail impress mind 
brought original way 
tutor sometimes father visited galleries museums villas ruins catacombs environs rome 
father calvi equally sensitive beauties nature art taught early age understand poetic melancholy 
roman campagna harmony arch line sky arches ruined aqueducts fine tracery pines understood could read mastered first rudiments arithmetic 
able set english tourists right names carracci caravaggio caused confusion 
learned latin early without effort familiar italian language 
gave opinion italian foreign masters however unsophisticated made father tutor look astonishment 
like ribera great contrast color pictures frightened little liked carlo dolce 
short tutor father friends considered prodigy heard praised flattered vanity 
healthiest educations nervous system developed early always remained sensitive 
seems strange influences neither deep lasting might expected 
become artist owing may lack gifts way although drawing music masters opined differently neither father priest able imbue love art art sake feeling art yes 
art necessity life yes 
loved feel dilettante necessity far complements every kind pleasant delightful sensation 
one delights absorbing passion like live without could devote whole life 
schools rome left much desired father sent college metz carried honors prizes little effort 
year last term ran away join carlos tristan detachment wandered time pyrenees father help consul burgos found sent back metz duly punished 
penalty heavy one father teachers secretly proud escapade 
brilliant success examinations quickly earned full absolution 
among schoolfellows whose sympathies naturally carlos henceforth passed hero time one foremost pupils position first school beyond dispute 
growing conviction later larger sphere would 
opinion shared teachers schoolfellows yet fact many schoolfellows one time would dreamed competing occupy day france high places literary scientific political spheres whereas choose profession feel considerably perplexed 
social position excellent 
possess independent means mother side shall inherit father fortune time come administer ploszow estate less wisely case may limitation work excludes hope distinguishing life playing prominent part 
shall never great administrator agriculturist though mean shirk duties could devote whole life simple reason aspirations aim much higher 
sometimes ask whether ploszowskis delude abilities 
case delusion would personal people strangers could deceived way 
besides know father extraordinarily gifted man 
enter fully subject might appear mere boastfulness nevertheless conviction could something infinitely greater 
instance warsaw father aunt wished enter university sniatynski fellow students 
drawn towards literature tried hand 
say looked upon gifted two truth work considered better promising sniatynski sniatynski years past occupied prominent position literature still greatly promising pan ploszowski people wont say would take something ah rub would seem take account one know 
thought sometimes means subsistence work 
certainly something order earn bread even firmly convinced derive twentieth part advantage capacities 
besides men darwin buckle rich sir john lubbock banker known men france easy circumstances 
proves wealth hindrance rather help towards attaining proper standing chosen field labor 
confess far concerned done service preserved character many crookedness poverty might exposed 
mean weak character although struggle existence might made stronger still maintain less stony road less chance fall 
owing constitutional laziness either nullity 
possess alike great facility acquiring knowledge desire read much good memory 
perhaps could summon energy enough long slow work greater facility ought serve instead besides urgent necessity write encyclopedias like littre

come back waited long time vain 
know whether thinking misery weeping perfectly indifferent 
three met lunch sitting nothing unusual happened 
perhaps fancy made think laura looked menacingly also apathetic expression even mournful usual 
confess tame ending business painful 
one provoke quarrel ready answer deeds finally would rather man defenceless small miserable creature 
nasty feeling knocked cripple never yet felt disgusted 
went boat usual 
want laura think afraid davis first quarrel 
confessed scruples laughed 
said plainly laughter become remember may things becoming 
deep frown meeting eyebrows replied bitterly passed us may insult even impunity could davis 
reproach remained nothing else ask forgiveness presently harmony restored laura began talk 
another instance cleverness 
generally women known intimately showed desire tell life 
blame shows feel need justify eyes 
men 
yet never met woman either clever overstep artistic proportions confession sincere tell lies order justify 
call witness men occasion occurs may verify wonderfully similar cases going astray consequently tedious 
laura began talk certain eager satisfaction respect follow beaten track fallen angels 
told certain posing originality certainly posing victim 
knowing deal sceptic want call forth smile incredulity 
sincerity skirting upon bold almost cynical one might say system life aestheticism taken place ethics 
prefers simply life shape apollo humpbacked pulcinello philosophy 
married davis much wealth purpose making life beautiful lay human power beautiful common meaning word highest artistic sense 
besides consider duties toward husband never even pretended love much pity repugnance indifferent everything account dead

morning three aunt aniela went funeral young cleric 
strange sight village procession headed priest coffin cart followed crowd peasants men women singing tune sad weird set chaldean music 
furthest end men women talking drawling half sleepy way 
going along among rowan trees procession came glare sun kerchiefs flashed flames blue red yellow coffin incense juniper berries made procession rather look like wedding funeral 
death seem make much impression upon rustic mind perhaps regard light everlasting holiday 
stood open grave noticed faces following ceremony concentrated attention curiosity saw trace thoughtfulness reflection inexorable end begins great terrible unknown 
looked aniela stooped handful soil throw upon lowered coffin 
paler usual sun shining upon could read transparent features open book 
certain thinking death 
seemed simply monstrous horrible improbability face full expression full life charming individuality time stony white remain eternal darkness 
sudden frost nipped thoughts grew suddenly conscious first ceremony assisted aniela funeral 
person long sickness lost faith medicine turns quack doctors wise women sick soul doubting everything still clings certain superstitions 
probably one near gulf mysticism absolute sceptic 
lost faith religious sociological ideals whose belief power science human intellect shaken whole mass highly cultured people uncertain way deprived dogmas hopelessly struggling dark drift towards mysticism 
seems spring everywhere usual reaction society whose life based upon positivism overthrow ideals empty pleasures soulless striving gain 
human spirit begins burst shell narrow much like stock exchange 
one epoch draws end appears simultaneous evolution directions 
struck often amazement instance recent great writers seem know close upon mysticism 
conscious confess openly 
every book opened lately found human soul personal passions merely fatal forces characteristics terrible beings independent personal manifestations living alone within like goethe mother

april 
intoxicate life ploszow daily sight aniela forget belongs somebody else 
kromitzki somewhere baku still appears something unreal deprived real existence something bad might come upon us instance death one think continually 
yesterday something happened bring mind 
small apparently natural incident 
aniela received breakfast two letters 
aunt asked whether husband replied yes 
hearing felt sensation condemned man may feel rouse sweet dream order tell hair cut guillotine 
saw whole misfortune distinctly ever sensation remained whole day especially aunt quite unconsciously course bent upon torturing 
aniela wanted put reading letters aunt insisted upon opening presently inquired kromitzki 
thank aunty well 
affairs going thank god writes everything prospers beyond expectation 
think coming back says soon possibly manage 
sensitiveness listen questions answers 
aunt aniela started unexpectedly quite improbable cynical conversation could shocked 
first time since arrival ploszow felt something like resentment towards aniela 
little mercy least speak man presence return thanks asked say thank god prosperous thought 
mean time opened second letter looking date said written earlier date began read 
looked bowed head parting hair drooping lashes seemed reading lasted long 
thought world mutual interests aims bound two together indispensable reason must feel belonged 
felt part force circumstances always outside life even love 
felt depth misery one sees depth precipice veiled clouds

ironical remark gave momentary relief 
let aware jealous thought mother aunt belong women angelic kind believe evil world 
let understand love become familiar thought troubled fight 
bring soul strange decomposing element ferment like half battle 
shall see happen afterwards 
momentary great relief much like wicked delight 
presently alone carriage felt angry disgusted disgusted became conscious littleness thought felt based upon overstrung fanciful nerves worthy hysterical woman man 
heavy journey far heavier one return abroad went first time ploszow 
reflecting upon terrible incapacity life casts shadow upon existence existence like came conclusion main source feminine element predominates character 
mean physically effeminate wanting manly courage 
something quite different 
courage daring deficient regards psychical elements every one us 
us lack synthetic faculty distinguishes things important 
least matter discourages hurts repulses us consequence sacrifice great things small ones 
past proof thereof 
sacrificed inexpressible happiness future future beloved woman read aunt letter kromitzki wished marry 
nerves took bit teeth carried wish go

distant hamlets one could see going indian file along narrow paths amid corn though still green shot considerable height owing early spring 
far eye could reach pure translucid atmosphere bright colored kerchiefs girls appeared wheat fields like many poppy flowers 
bye nowhere europe breadth atmosphere poland 
struck distinctly sunday character day people alone also nature 
true weather splendid seemed wind hushed sunday even corn rock leaf shook poplars stillness perfect yet cheerfulness sunday festive garments dancing sunbeams 
explained aniela artistic point view bright spots harmonized landscape melted distance blue haze 
began talk peasants 
confessed see anything crowd less picturesque models aniela looks quite different point view 
began telling many characteristic traits sad amusing talking grew animated time lovely summer dream 
conversation drifted towards old couple left sitting church gate especially old woman whose reasoning amused us much 
began comparing position

aniela ceased laughing jesting slackened pace presently joined elder ladies 
remainder day passed without cloud pleasantly times fancied schoolboy 
eyes still spoke love desires slept 
aunt went warsaw lunch remained pani celina room reading montalembert letters father one time regular correspondence 
letters would seemed tedious aniela presence 
raising eyes met glance filled inexpressible joy 
unless lost power judgment looks would look pure innocent woman unconsciously loving soul

used italian scirocco mind much pani celina suffered greatly indirectly aniela 
aunt bad temper damage done park usual vented chwastowski 
peppery old gentleman probably caned often enough homer evidently forgotten odyssey ready speech either replied aunt aeolus would serve agent bear unjust tantrums 
aunt gave way time merely redoubled threats skies 
grown still south banks cloud black funereal pall overcast sickly red sheen came rolling 
moment grew dark night pani celina rung lights 
shortly afterwards darkness yielded ominous reddish light 
chwastowski rushed hurry give orders cattle driven home cow herds started without waiting orders presently heard distinctly mournful lowing cattle 
aunt fetched bell lady loreto went around house ringing energetically 
even try explain ringing bell motionless atmosphere might rather attract avert thunderbolt spite consciousness case danger could slightest help ashamed let risk danger alone 
old lady simply magnificent head thrown back seemed defy black copper colored banks clouds shook loreto bell 
regret gone see symbolic picture 
moment everything trembles approaching horror crouches terror almost stupefied faith alone fear defies rings bell 
whatever side look element incalculable power human soul 
returned first thunder began growl around horizon 
minutes later roar became incessant 
sensation thunder rolled lower stratum clouds whole mass would burst moment come deafening crash upon earth 
thunderbolt fell pond end park followed another close house shook foundations 
ladies began say litany felt uncertain joined would hypocrisy part would look showing ill bred wiseacre make allowance country customs female terrors 
wrong afraid faces calm even serene 
evident familiar litany sufficient armor dangers fear hearts 
thought crossed mind stranger spirit presence polish women knows ten times less according human measure worth ten times much like books comparatively pages page containing clear simple rules whereas volumes composed possess single undoubted truth 
passing thought presently storm broke upon us terrific force engaged attention 
wind rose crashing among trees 
fell moments rain came streams drops visible long spouts seemed join sky earth 
avenues park like foaming brooks 
sometimes strong gust wind whipped water fine spray hung earth sky obscured whole view 
deafening roar thunder went incessantly 
air saturated electricity 
pulses beating loudly rooms irritating smell sulphur made felt 
raging elements without seemed influence strange way began lose control 
want see storm asked aniela

another moment folded arms pressed lips let ploszow razed ground tempest 
terrified storm expression face whisper drew back window returned room elder ladies sitting 
remained alone feeling anger humiliation 
taken advantage aniela confidence quite certain yet felt offended want trust resolved pay way 
stood hour window looking absently lightning flashes 
grew lighter lighter outside last clouds parted sun shone forth fresh bright wondering devastation tempest wrought 
considerable avenues still flooded yellow foaming water floated broken branches 
big trees lying snapped across torn roots bark partly stripped trunks pine trees leaving looked like gaping wounds 
everywhere eye could reach ruin devastation battle 
water drained little went toward ponds ascertain extent damage 
suddenly whole park became alive people almost savage energy began tear broken branches chop fallen trunks 
appears peasant lodgers right woods 
main care whether gathered sticks come broken fence without permission savage manner humor began drive away anger rising stubborn resistance 
last threatened village authorities suddenly close sweetest voice world said french harm clearing park leon turned round saw aniela head covered kerchief tied chin 
hands holding dress showing ankles little feet encased high boots bending slightly forward looked entreatingly 
sight anger vanished 
forgot unpleasant sensations troubled little looked could never fill enough sight 
wish asked 
turning people said take wood thank lady permission 
time obeyed alacrity 
evidently strangers ploszow addressed gracious panienka miss caused unspeakable delight 
ploszow mine might cut every tree wish 
half hour every broken branch fallen tree cleared away park looked really better 
walking aniela along paths found great many swallows birds either killed storm half dead drenched rain 
picked handing one one aniela touched hands looked eyes felt happy

clara seemed struck aniela beauty always says thinks expressed admiration much grace enthusiasm aniela yield 
pani celina perhaps first time found company artist looked gratified turning said though aniela mother must say child pretty promising far greater beauty 
sniatynskis joined conversation 
began discuss clara various female types spoke aniela type aesthetic perfection highly amusing objective manner portrait hanging wall rather living presence 
listening blushed lowered eyes truly like little girl made look charming ever 
silent inwardly compared three female faces treating also objectively putting aside fact one loved one occupied exceptional position even everything spoke favor 
pani sniatynska especially short curly hair charming head yet nothing may found english keepsake 
clara beauty rests mainly upon calm expression blue eyes transparent complexion often met german women art surrounds nimbus could called handsome woman 
aniela artistic production exceedingly noble style regards features something individual measured standard 
maybe individuality rests upon fact neither dark fair gives physical impression brunette spiritual one blonde 
cause perhaps great abundance hair comparatively small head enough unique kind 
excels even mrs davis regard whose beauty without flaw beauty statue 
mrs davis excited admiration senses aniela rouses idealist goes rapture poetry expression 
even compare two utterly different beings 
yielded reflections lunch topic question brought track besides analysis aniela beauty always gives keen delight
