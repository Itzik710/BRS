turned hastily spoke soon lost little belt woodland lay lake miner camp 
pleased gashford keep gold huge leathern bag hid hole ground within tent day placed pillow night 
pleased also dwell work alone partly unsociable disposition partly prevent men becoming acquainted secrets 
seem much fear big miner secrets discovered lynch law prevailed camp time well known death usual punishment theft 
also well known gashford splendid shot revolver well fierce unscrupulous man 
strong drink revealed might otherwise safe 
cups gashford sometimes became boastful gave hints easily understood 
still gold safe apart danger attempt rob bully would impossible discover particular part tent floor hole dug venturing touch pillow shaggy head rested one daring enough contemplate act although men capable almost anything 
however strong drink proved big miner foe 
occasionally though often gashford drank deeply become almost helpless lying bed sank sleep profound seemed could roused even violence 
condition night victim made mind rob 
despair brandy united render brixton utterly reckless much instead creeping stealthily towards enemy tent act would probably aroused suspicion light sleeper walked boldly entered raised gashford unconscious head one hand pulled bag gold put shoulder coolly marched camp 
audacity deed contributed largely success 
great rage consternation gashford awoke following morning found treasure disappeared 
jumping conclusion stolen brixton ran youth tent demanded know thief gone

without another word gashford thrust revolver pocket flung aside tent curtain strode away 
meanwhile tom brixton gold game bag slung across shoulder speeding valley mountain gorge head pine tree diggings lay vigor activity youthful strength none exultation might supposed characterise successful thief 
contrary weight like lead seemed lie heart faces mother friend fred westly seemed flit continually gazing sorrowful expression 
fumes liquor drunk began dissipate shame depression spirit increased strength great though began give way 
time however placed many mile camp committed robbery 
valley opened wide almost boundless stretch comparatively level land covered forests dense concealed recesses would exceedingly difficult impossible white men trace especially men little acquainted woodcraft diggers 
besides region undulating form tops many eminences could see whole land observe approach enemies without seen 
feeling therefore comparatively safe paused mad flight went hands knees take long drink bubbling spring 
rising refreshed deep sigh slowly mounted top knoll bathed time first beams rising sun 
spot obtained view intermingled forest prairie lake river resplendent even mind moment diverted gloomy introspections glance admiration shot eyes chased wrinkles brow frown quickly returned glorious landscape forgotten thought dreadful condition returned overwhelming power 
day tom brixton faults kept within circle world laws 
well trained boyhood approval mother left england oregon goldfields company steady well principled friend playmate early childhood school 
two friends experienced three years varying fortune digger life sometimes working long periods successfully gradually increasing pile times toiling day day nothing living capital whole making men called good thing tom took gambling almost matter course led drinking 
process demoralisation continued seen boundary line last overstepped become thief outlaw 
period diggings judge lynch words hand speedy justice community miners order day stealing become exasperatingly common penalty appointed death judges cases prompt executioners

chapter two 
brixton hurrying guilty conscience deeper deeper dark woods covered spur mountains neighborhood pine tree diggings glancing back nervously time time expected pursuers close heels enemy advancing meet front little dreamed 
brown bear either enjoying morning walk look breakfast suddenly met face face stood hind legs good look 
tom coward indeed gifted average amount animal courage 
levelled rifle creature breast fired 
bear rushed nevertheless uninjured 
drawing revolver tom discharged two shots monster reached 
three shots taken effect bears noted tenacity life frequently able fight furious battle mortally wounded 
rifle ball touched heart revolver bullets gone deep chest yet showed little sign hurt 
knowing full well fate awaited stood wrestle bear youth turned run bear quick 
struck back felled earth 
strange say moment tom brixton ill gotten gains stood good stead 
question bear tremendous claws would sunk deep youth back probably broken spine arrested bag gold slung back 
although knocked slightly stunned brixton still unwounded even act falling presence mind draw long knife plunge haft creature side time twisting violently round fall back thus face foe 
position partly owing form ground bear found difficult grasp opponent awful embrace held claws seized left shoulder teeth 
rendered use revolver impossible fortunately brixton right arm still free drove keen knife second time deep animal sides 
whether mortal wound immediately kill 
tom felt hour come deadly fear came thought death recent life judgment flashed brain 
drew knife however make another desperate thrust 
bear great throat close face 
thought jugular vein made deadly thrust spot imagined run 
instantly flood warm blood deluged face breast time felt dreadful weight pressing death 
consciousness forsook 
desperate fight going miners pine tree camp scouring woods directions search fugitive 
said great indignation felt time thieves become daring cases theft multiplying 
severe penalties imposed culprits rest community without curing evil 
last death decided penalty act theft however trifling might 
men earnest proved summary execution next two offenders caught 
immediately thieving came abrupt end insomuch left bag gold exposed place men would gone way avoid one understand therefore indignation roused camp tom brixton revived practice cool impudent manner 
felt despite favorite many diggers must made example 
pursuit therefore organised extensive scale methodical manner 
among others friend fred westly took part 
cost diggers something thus give exciting work gold finding chase promised occupy time tax perseverance 
even refused join whole desire vengeance seemed general 
bully gashford object called virtue size energy desperate character tacitly appointed leader 
indeed would assumed position accorded made stuff produces either heroes highest type scoundrels deepest dye 
arranged pursuers proceed body mouth valley dividing several parties scatter abroad find thief trail follow 
miners much accustomed following trails engaged services several indians chanced camp time 
direction ye think likely precious chum taken asked gashford turning abruptly fred westly different parties start 
impossible tell

go ahead red reptile added giving sign indian head party selected lead 
indian went swinging walk amounting almost trot 
others followed suit forest soon swallowed dark embrace 
making selection gashford fallen mistake uncommon among scoundrels judging men 
knew westly fond guilty friend concluded would tell falsehood put pursuers false scent might favor escape 
also guessed fond guessing fred would answer question indicating direction thought probable friend taken 
guesses small extent right 
westly indeed earnestly hope friend would escape deemed intended punishment death unjustly severe knowing intimately character tendencies tom brixton mind tastes pretty shrewd guess direction taken far desiring throw pursuers scent main anxiety join party thought likely find fugitive find order might present defend sudden unnecessary violence
