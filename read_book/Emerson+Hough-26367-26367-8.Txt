buffalo ran ran wind downwind like deer 
remember 
take antelope 
old hunters always knew antelope shed horns deer scientists denied years happen see shed horns 
antelope buck horn pull hand month may left soft core exposed covered coarse black filaments like black hairs

took lewis clark thirty five days get mouth yellowstone done one might say 
railroad calls three hundred sixty seven miles 
well journal calls broke rob yet sticks right river 
began travel added john 
twenty eighteen twenty five seventeen miles day right along n mandan lot 
make six hundred forty one miles yellowstone marias 
eighteen miles day 
yet say river current much stiffer 
found stiff places said leader 
reason well paper sail canoes well great deal towing 
shores full sharp rocks going rough moccasins complained bitterly sore feet 
hardships made overestimate distances overestimate much 
tracking rat portage ice water arctic circle remember figured double actually done man wife corrected long married 
said twenty years said ten records 
well seems longer said 
way ten miles day stumbling tracking line called twenty 
seemed longer 
river commission measured distances accurately called seventeen hundred sixty miles mouth river mouth yellowstone eighteen hundred journal 
buford benton river six hundred forty one miles journal makes five hundred three 
first white men ca ons palisades us yonder one hundred thirty eight miles estimates one fourth real distance 
tendency overestimate distances almost universal among explorers set first distances ought reckoned factor error like dip magnetic needle 
best 
want remember first white men come river whereas last anyhow resumed rob old benton 
yes think even jesse agree stop sum central point every way worth standing place would passed river run 
heart buffalo country heart old blackfoot hunting range dreaded tribes early traders met 
breaks missouri right 
look vast plains 
buffalo pasture blackfeet 
crows lay yellowstone 
came bad lands upper breaks big river explorers gave names lot creeks buttes stick 
two stick judith marias 
clark called first judith river miss julia hancock virginia lady later married 
friends called judy clark figured ought judith 
way lewis called river near whose mouth standing maria river cousin miss maria wood 
clark river famous military days famous wheat belt judith basin lost possessive plain judith 
meriwether lewis still letters spelled marias river without possessive apostrophe 
stand even day names two virginia girls doubt remain water runs grass grows indians say 
even forgotten something uncle dick interrupted john 
said forks road 
mean yes 
later proved one great strategic points west 
know head steamboat navigation outfitting point bull trains supplied country west south north us 
old post famous 

reference really fort benton mouth marias river 
see nearly even day marias resembles missouri river 
suppose captain jess map nothing go came two rivers idea earth one coming closest columbia idea either headed would huh answered jesse hesitation 
know done 
yes asked indian girl sac gawea done 
knew country say 
jove bit bad jess come think 
look journal 
find precisely first time needed ask something could girl sick great falls 
thought going die wonder read gave way medicines 
head part time 
never asked thing choice rivers well spent week deciding time well spent 
sent small parties fork little way men thought marias right hand fork true missouri 
clark sent south fork clearer 
went thirty five miles 
gone twenty miles farther great falls minnetaree indians told falls eagle nest though said nothing river north 
chaboneau never 
wife nearly dead 
one could help 
lewis took men went marias sixty miles 
came back marias decided left hand fork judgment every man clark 
reasoning good 
men pointed right hand fork roily boiling rolling exactly like missouri come whereas fork clear 
lewis said showed marias ran plains country lead close rockies water would run clearer want skirt mountains northerly cross going west 
lewis old english map made man named arrowsmith based reports hudson bay trader named fidler gone little south saskatchewan made observations 
look journal see lewis thought mr fidler 
latter marked detached peak forty five degrees latitude 
yet lewis time setting latitude longitude frequent observations makes marias forty seven degrees twenty four minutes twelve eight tenths seconds 
says river must therefore turn much south rocky mountain permitted mr fidler passed along eastern border mountains far south nearly without even seeing capt clark says course w still appeared bear considerably w south think therefore shall find missouri enters rocky mountains north 
take liberty placing discoveries least southern extremity degree farther north rather suspect actual observations take least one degree north 
general course marias river w 
lewis also figured fidler map showed small streams coming west presumption strong little streams penetrate rocky mountains distance would afford rational grounds conjecture sources near navigable branch columbia 
right says little creeks may run river indians called medicine river 
sun river come falls lewis never seen minnetaree indians told long map making talks mandan winter quarters river near falls clear saw stream 
minnetarees told missouri river interlocked columbia 
straight west minnetarees figured went hunting head missouri passed river big south fork without mentioning 
indians said falls little south sunset mandans lewis latitude show still line ought hold 
lastly reasoned large river must penetrate deeply rockies wanted 
knew could rise dry plains 
relying minnetarees horse sense mr fidler lewis refused go farther north could figure big river penetrating rockies 
absolutely right well shrewd wise 
reasoning first shot voyageurs would gone marias 
cruzatte especially best riverman certain marias true missouri 
would maybe met blackfeet would never crossed rockies would meant failure death whereas cold headed careful young man meriwether lewis chain exact reasoning actual data went judgment entire party chose left hand fork know true missouri find hard enough follow head even day 
think boys 
begin see man must leader plenty army men western exploration since plenty engineers could spell 
records find one example responsibility handled quietly decisively 
must remember pressure 
would easy take united conviction old grizzled experienced voyageurs hunters 
well clark argued least known 
men took decision two leaders without whimper 
think personnel party must extraordinary 
leaders proved judgment later 
poor sac gawea expected die responsibility shoulders captains acted though doubts 
lewis solved ascended marias way home next year 
water getting swift 
knew nothing ahead load heavy 
hid biggest boat willows island mouth marias dug cache great deal outfit axes ammunition casks provisions much superfluous stuff 
dug bottle shaped old fur traders lined boughs grass hides filled put back cap sod dirt piled skins show

found eagle nest cottonwood island minnetarees told 
sac gawea got well gave ok delirium gone every man woman child party agreed leaders safe follow took one month get eighteen miles portage 
made five weeks lost direct travel

poor men also bad case many time held 
floggings side mandan maybe men captains learned something discipline 
leader ceased time turned hat hand ruined quadrangle adobe remnants old fort benton 
boys also moment remained silent
