preface 
may perhaps thought prefacing manual drawing ought expatiate reasons drawing learned reasons appear many weighty quickly state enforce 
reader permission volume large already waive discussion respecting importance subject touch points may appear questionable method treatment 
ii 
first place book calculated use children age twelve fourteen 
think advisable engage child voluntary practice art 
talent drawing continually scrawling paper get allowed scrawl free due praise given every appearance care truth efforts 
allowed amuse cheap colors almost soon sense enough wish 
merely daubs paper shapeless stains color box may taken away till knows better soon begins painting red coats soldiers striped flags ships etc colors command without restraining choice subject imaginative historical art military tendency children delight generally quite valuable way historical art delighted elders gently led parents try draw childish fashion may things see likes birds butterflies flowers fruit 
iii 
later years indulgence using color granted reward shown care progress drawings pencil 
limited number good amusing prints always within boy reach days cheap illustration hardly possess volume nursery tales without good wood cuts encouraged copy likes best kind firmly restricted prints books 
child many toys get tired break boy many prints merely dawdle scrawl limitation number possessions pleasure perfected attention concentrated 
parents need give trouble instructing far drawing concerned beyond insisting upon economical neat habits colors paper showing best way holding pencil rule far take notice work pointing line short long crooked compared copy accuracy first last thing look 
child shows talent inventing grouping figures parents neither check praise 
may laugh frankly show pleasure done show pleasure seeing well cheerful must praise clever would praise stout 
praise costs self denial namely attention hard work otherwise make work vanity sake always badly 
best books put hands illustrated george cruikshank richter 
see appendix 
age twelve fourteen quite time enough set youth girl serious work book think useful good hope may likewise persons advanced age wishing know something first principles art 
iv 
yet observe method study recommended brought forward absolutely best best present devise isolated student 
likely farther experience teaching may enable modify advantage several important respects sure main principles sound exercises useful rendered without master superintendence 
method differs however materially generally adopted drawing masters word two explanation may needed justify might otherwise thought willful eccentricity 
v manuals present published subject drawing directed far know one two objects 
either propose give student power dexterous sketching pencil water color emulate considerable distance slighter work second rate artists propose give accurate command mathematical forms may afterwards enable design rapidly cheaply manufactures 
drawing taught accomplishment first aim usually proposed second object kept chiefly view marlborough house branch government schools design 
vi 
fitness modes study adopted schools end specially intended judgment hardly yet possible seems much habit confusing art applied manufacture manufacture 
instance skill inventive workman designs molds beautiful cup skill true art skill cup copied afterwards multiplied thousandfold skill manufacture faculties enable one workman design elaborate original piece developed system instruction enable another produce maximum number approximate copies given time 
farther surely inexpedient reference purposes manufacture interfere education artist 
try first manufacture raphael let raphael direct manufacture 
design plate cup house palace whenever want design convenient rational way let anxiety reach platter cup interfere education raphael 
obtain first best work ablest hands irrespective consideration economy facility production 
leave trained artist determine far art popularized manufacture ennobled 
vii 
believe irrespective differences individual temper character excellence artist depends wholly refinement perception mainly master school teach powers invention distinguish man man powers perception distinguish school school 
great schools enforce delicacy drawing subtlety sight rule yet found without exception respecting art great art delicate 
viii 
therefore chief aim bent following system obtain first perfectly patient utmost pupil power delicate method work may insure seeing truly 
nearly convinced see keenly enough little difficulty drawing see even supposing difficulty still great believe sight important thing drawing would rather teach drawing pupils may learn love nature teach looking nature may learn draw 
surely also important thing young people unprofessional students know appreciate art others gain much power art 
modes sketching ordinarily taught inconsistent power judgment 
person trained superficial execution modern water color painting understand work titian leonardo must forever remain blind refinement men penciling precision thinking 
however slight degree manipulative power student may reach pursuing mode recommended letters answer go advised exercises without beginning understand masterly work means time gained proficiency pleasure looking painting great schools new perception exquisiteness natural scenery would repay much labor asked undergo 
ix 
labor nevertheless sufficiently irksome possible otherwise long pupil works unassisted master 
smooth straight road admits unembarrassed progress must fear dull well smooth hedges need close trim guide warn bring back erring traveler 
system followed work therefore first surprise somewhat sorrowfully familiar practice class working men college pupil master side extricate embarrassments first efforts may lead set draw solid object soon finds entertainment efforts interest difficulties 
course simplest object possible set eye sphere practically find child toy white leather ball better anything else gradations balls plaster paris use sometimes try strength pupils previous practice little delicate beginner perceive 
objected circle outline sphere one difficult lines draw 
want drawn 
study ball teach pupil way shade gives appearance projection 
learns satisfactorily sphere solid form terminated straight lines flat surfaces owes appearance projection perspective sphere without shade flat circle becomes merely added shade image solid ball fact striking learner whether circular outline true false 
therefore never allowed trouble makes ball look oval egg degree error simply pointed better next time better still next 
mind always fixed gradation shade outline left take due time care 
call outline sake immediate intelligibility strictly speaking merely edge shade pupil class ever allowed draw outline ordinary sense 
pointed first nature relieves one mass one tint another outlines none 
outline exercise second suggested letter recommended enable pupil draw outlines means unassisted test accuracy eye discipline hand 
master errors form extent shadows pointed easily outline handling gradually corrected details work 
solitary student find mistakes help traced limit test firmness hand exercise nothing firmness required considerations softness complexity etc entirely excluded 
x system adopted working men college recommended agree however one principle consider important special involved teaching namely attaching full importance first local color 
believe endeavor separate course instruction observation light shade local color always must always destructive student power accurate sight corrupts taste much retards progress 
occupy reader time discussion principle wish note distinctive one system far system 
recommendation pupil copy faithfully without alteration whatever natural object chooses study serviceable among reasons gets rid systematic rules altogether teaches people draw country lads learn ride without saddle stirrups main object first get pupils hold reins prettily sit like jackanapes never 
xi 
written instructions therefore always regret seen forced advise anything like monotonous formal discipline 
unassisted student formalities indispensable without hope sense secure advancement pleasure independent effort may render following even tedious exercises proposed possible solitary learner without weariness 
otherwise finds first steps painfully irksome desire consider whether acquirement great power pictorial expression thought worth toil whether likely natural order matters working world great gift attainable give price 
xii 
one task however difficulty student find imposed upon namely learning laws perspective 
would worth learn could easily without master help way perspective present explained treatises difficulty greater gain 
perspective slightest use except rudimentary work 
draw rounding line table perspective draw sweep sea bay foreshorten log wood foreshorten arm 
laws gross applied subtle form therefore must learn draw subtle forms eye certainly may draw simple ones 
great painters ever trouble perspective know laws draw everything eye naturally enough disdain easy parts work rules help difficult ones 
would take month labor draw imperfectly laws perspective great venetian draw perfectly five minutes throwing wreath leaves round head bending curves pattern among folds drapery 
true perspective first discovered everybody amused great painters put fine saloons arcades behind madonnas merely show could draw perspective even generally done catch public eye disdained perspective much though took greatest pains circlet crown rim crystal cup heart picture would twist capitals columns towers churches background wanton way wherever liked lines go provided left perspective enough please public 
xiii 
modern days doubt artist among us except david roberts knows much perspective would enable draw gothic arch scale given angle distance 
turner though professor perspective royal academy know professed never far remember drew single building true perspective life drew much perspective suited 
prout also knew nothing perspective twisted buildings turner whatever shapes liked 
justify would recommend student least treat perspective common civility pay court 
best way learn taking pane glass fixed frame set upright eye distance proposed sketch intended seen 
let eye placed fixed point opposite middle pane glass high low student likes brush end stick little body color adhere glass lines landscape may traced glass see 
traced true perspective 
glass sloped direction lines still true perspective perspective calculated sloping plane common perspective always supposes plane picture vertical 
good early practice accustom inclose subject sketching light frame wood held upright show may legitimately take picture choice narrow foreground near wide one farther also height tree building properly take etc

figure drawing nothing said following pages think figures chief subjects drawn good purpose amateur 
accessaries landscape drawn principles anything else

lastly directions given subsequently student found obscure stage recommended practice find difficulties enough provided may apply letter mr ward drawing master working men college great ormond street give required assistance lowest terms remunerate occupation time 
leisure general answer letters inquiry however much may desire mr ward always power referring question thinks necessary 
good hope however enough guidance given work prevent occurrence serious embarrassment believe student obeys directions find whole best answerer questions perseverance best drawing masters woods hills 

footnotes accurately appears one see error circle 
b student fond architecture wishes know perspective learn rough way mr runciman acacia road st john wood first drawing master owe many happy hours teach quickly easily rightly 
mr runciman died since written mr ward present address bedford chambers southampton street strand london wc elements drawing 
letter first practice 

dear reader whether book use depends wholly reason wishing learn draw 
desire possess graceful accomplishment able converse fluent manner drawing amuse listlessly listless hours help wish learn drawing may able set clearly usefully records things described words either assist memory convey distinct ideas people wish obtain quicker perceptions beauty natural world preserve something like true image beautiful things pass away must leave also wish understand minds great painters able appreciate work sincerely seeing loving merely taking thoughts people help better show help 

must understand first powers indeed noble desirable got without work 
much easier learn draw well learn play well musical instrument know takes three four years practice giving three four hours day acquire even ordinary command keys piano must think masterly command pencil knowledge may done acquired without painstaking short time 
kind drawing taught supposed taught schools term two perhaps rate hour practice week drawing 
performance dexterous always even evolutions paper black lead pencil profitless alike performer beholder unless matter vanity smallest possible vanity 
young person taught polite circles called drawing try copy commonest piece real work suppose lithograph titlepage new opera air wood cut cheapest illustrated newspaper day find entirely beaten 
yet common lithograph drawn coarse chalk much difficult manage pencil accomplished young lady supposed command wood cut drawn urgent haste half spoiled cutting afterwards done people nobody thinks artists praises power done daily bread artist pride simple handicraftsmen feel work live 

therefore think learn drawing new language without hard disagreeable labor 
hand ready willing pay price fear may unable get want special talent 
indeed true persons peculiar talent art draw instinctively get almost without teaching though never without toil 
true also inferior talent drawing many degrees take one person much longer time another attain results results thus painfully attained never quite satisfactory got greater ease faculties naturally adapted study 
never yet experiments made met person could learn draw general satisfactory available power every one learn drawing wishes nearly persons power learning french latin arithmetic decent useful degree lot life requires possess knowledge 

supposing ready take certain amount pains bear little irksomeness disappointments bravely promise hour practice day six months hour practice every day twelve months disposed whatever way find convenient hundred fifty hours practice give sufficient power drawing faithfully whatever want draw good judgment certain point people work hours one spare present may well begin 
exercise 
everything see world around presents eyes arrangement patches different colors variously shaded 
patches color appearance lines texture within piece cloth silk threads animal skin shows texture hairs whether case first broad aspect thing patch definite color first thing learned produce extents smooth color without texture 

done properly brush brush soft point causes much uncertainty touch unpracticed hand hardly possible learn draw first better take early practice instrument hard fine point may give support hand working subject delicate point attention may properly directed minute parts 
even best artists need occasionally study subjects pointed instrument order thus discipline attention beginner must content considerable period 
illustration fig 


also observe trouble differences color must able lay one color properly whatever gradations depth whatever shapes want 
try therefore first lay tints patches gray whatever depth want pointed instrument 
take finely pointed steel pen one gillott lithographic crowquills best piece quite smooth shining note paper cream laid get ink stood already time inkstand quite black thick without clogging pen 
take rule draw four straight lines inclose square nearly square large fig 

say nearly square least matter whether quite square object merely get space inclosed straight lines 

try fill square space crossed lines completely evenly shall look like square patch gray silk cloth cut laid white paper b 
cover quickly first straightish lines direction like troubling draw much closer neater square 
let quite dry retouching 
draw three four squares side side may always going one others drying 
cover lines others different direction let dry another direction still let dry 
always wait long enough run risk blotting draw lines quickly 
ought laid swiftly dash pen good writer try reach great speed first go edge square fault exercise 
yet better draw lines slowly pen leaves little dot ink end line dots spoil work 
draw line quickly stopping always nearly edge square 
ends lines go edge afterwards removed penknife till done whole work otherwise roughen paper next line goes edge makes blot 

gone whole three four times find parts square look darker parts 
try make lighter parts dark rest whole may equal depth darkness 
find examining work looks darkest lines closest much darker lines elsewhere therefore must put lines little scratches dots lines paler parts conspicuous dark lines scratch lightly penknife eye must attracted line particular 
carefully delicately fill little gaps holes better get faster two three squares perfectly great many badly 
tint gets closer begins look even work little ink pen hardly make mark paper last dark use edge penknife lightly time wear softly even tone 
find greatest difficulty consists getting evenness one bit always look darker another bit square granulated sandy look whole 
find paper quite rough mess give begin another square rest satisfied till done best every square 
tint last ought least close even b fig 

find however difficult get pale tint naturally ink lines necessary produce close tint blacken paper want 
must get difficulty much leaving lines wide apart trying draw excessively fine lightly swiftly cautious filling last passing penknife whole 
keeping several squares progress one time reserving pen light one ink nearly exhausted may get better 
paper ought last look lightly evenly toned lines distinctly visible 
exercise ii 

exercise shading tiresome well vary proceeding another time 
power shading rightly depends mainly lightness hand keenness sight qualities required drawing dependent merely lightness steadiness hand eye perfect power must made accurate well keen see shrewdly measure justly 

possess therefore cheap work botany containing outline plates leaves flowers matter whether bad good baxter british flowering plants quite good enough 
copy simplest outlines first soft pencil following eye nearly look right proportions rub correct always eye till think right got mind lay tracing paper book paper trace outline copying apply thus ascertained faults correct patiently till got nearly accurate may 
work soft pencil rub hard spoil surface paper never mind dirty paper gets roughen let false outlines alone really interfere true one 
good thing accustom hew shape drawing dirty piece paper 
got right take quill pen fine point rest hand book inch half thick hold pen long go pencil outline ink raising pen point seldom possible never leaning heavily one part line another 
outline drawings present day parts curves thickened give effect shade outlines bad serve well enough exercises provided imitate character better however choose book pure outlines 
least matter whether pen outline thin thick matters greatly equal heavier one place another 
power obtained drawing even line slowly direction dashing lines approximations penmanship bad 
pen walk slowly ground able moment stop turn direction like well managed horse 

soon copy every curve slowly accurately made satisfactory progress find difficulty slowness 
easy draw appears good line sweep hand called freedom real difficulty masterliness never letting hand free keeping entire control every part line 
exercise iii 

meantime always going shaded squares chiefly outline exercises taken rest 
illustration fig 

soon find command pen shading instrument lay pale dark tint choose try produce gradated spaces like fig 
dark tint passing gradually lighter ones 
nearly expression form drawing depends power gradating delicately gradation always skillful passes one tint another little paler 
draw therefore two parallel lines limits work fig 
try gradate shade evenly white black passing greatest possible distance yet every part band may visible change 
perception gradation deficient beginners say many artists probably time think gradation skillful enough quite patchy imperfect 
getting piece gray shaded ribbon comparing drawing may arrive early stages work wholesome dissatisfaction 
widen band little little get skillful give gradation lateral space accustom time look gradated spaces nature 
sky largest beautiful watch twilight sun try consider pane glass window look piece paper colored blue gray purple happens observe quietly continuously gradation extends space window one two feet square 
observe shades outside inside common white cup bowl make look round hollow folds white drapery thus gradually led observe subtle transitions light increases declines flat surfaces 
last eye gets keen true see gradation everything nature 

power yet awhile draw objects gradations varied complicated bad omen future progress use art made first thing aim little bit sky 
take narrow space evening sky usually see boughs tree two chimneys corner pane window like best sit try gradate little space white paper evenly gradated tenderly gradate without color color either may evenly get impatient spots lines ink look beauty sky sense gained beauty something thankful 
ought impatient pen ink great painters however delicate perception color fond peculiar effect light may got pen ink sketch wood cut gleaming white paper black lines gradate well pure black lines never gradate well pale ones 
looking common wood cuts cheap publications day may see gradation given sky leaving lines farther farther apart must make lines fine well far apart towards light try make long straight let cross irregularly directions easy hand depending nothing gradation effect 
point direction lines however shall tell presently meantime trouble 
exercise iv 

soon find gradate tolerably pen take h hh 
pencil using point produce shade darkest possible palest exactly manner pen lightening however india rubber instead penknife 
find pale tints shade thus easily producible great precision tenderness get dark power pen ink surface shade apt become glossy metallic dirty looking sandy 
persevere however trying bring evenness fine point removing single speck line may black point knife must scratch whole knife ink 
find texture speckled looking lighten india rubber recover sharp excessively fine touches pencil point bringing parts pale perfect evenness darker spots 
use point delicately cunningly work drawing butterfly wing 

stage progress may assured clever friend come hold hands mocking amazement ask could set niggling persevere sustain considerable persecution artistical acquaintances generally tell good drawing depends boldness 
never mind 
hear tell child beginning music lay little hand crash among keys imitation great masters yet might reasonably may tell bold present state knowledge 
bold sense undaunted yes bold sense careless confident exhibitory thousand times even beginner would bad advice made bold 
mischief may easily done quickly good beautiful work generally done slowly find boldness way flower bird wing painted nature bold work think ought never mind people say work pencil point patiently trust anything trust tell though kinds ways art large work large places small work narrow places slow work people wait quick work people one quality think one great good art agrees delicate art 
coarse art always bad art 
understand present know yet much tender thought subtle care great painters put touches first look coarse believe true find due time 

perhaps also troubled first essays pencil drawing noticing delicate gradations got instant chance touch india rubber hour labor point may wonder tell produce tints painfully might appears obtained ease 
two reasons first come draw forms must able gradate absolute precision whatever place direction wish wise vaguely india rubber secondly natural shadows less mingled gleams light 
darkness ground light little pebbles dust darkness foliage glitter leaves darkness flesh transparency stone granulation every case mingling light represented leaden tone get rubbing instrument known artists stump 
manage point properly indeed able much also instrument fingers retouch flat tints afterwards put life light done point 
labor therefore courageously 
exercise v illustration fig 


manage tint gradate tenderly pencil point get good large alphabet try tint letters shape pencil point 
outline first measure height extreme breadth compasses b c fig 
scratch shapes gradually letter inclosed within lines turner would called state forwardness 
satisfied shape letter draw pen ink lines firmly round tint remove touches outside limit first india rubber penknife may look clear right 
rub pencil inside outline letter retouch closing inked line 
straight lines outline ruled curved lines drawn eye hand soon find good practice getting curved letters bs cs etc stand quite straight come accurate form 

exercises irksome persisted alone neither necessary acquire perfect power 
entire master pencil brush ought indeed able draw form giotto circle skill expected consummate master pencil hand life day long hence force giotto proof skill quite possible draw beautifully without attaining even approximation power main point every line precisely intend wish line intended wished draw right 
always see rightly mean rightly shall get though hand may stagger little mean wrongly mean nothing matter firm hand 
therefore torment well would like work patiently sure every square letter give certain increase power soon draw letters pretty well amusing exercise 
exercise vi 

choose tree think pretty nearly bare leaves see sky pale wall light ground must strong light find looking hurt eyes must sunshine puzzled lights boughs 
tree must shade sky blue gray dull white 
wholly gray rainy day best practice 

see boughs tree dark sky 
consider many dark rivers laid map absolute accuracy without least thought roundness stems map flat shade scrawling pencil limbs letters correct alter rubbing never minding much paper dirtied destroying surface every bough exactly near utmost power bring right curvature thickness 
look white interstices much scrupulousness little estates survey draw maps important lawsuit involving heavy penalties cut least bit corner gave hedge anywhere deep curve try continually fancy whole tree nothing flat ramification white ground 
take trouble little twigs look like confused network mist leave drawing main branches far see distinctly object present draw tree learn 
got thing nearly right better make one good study twenty left unnecessarily inaccurate take pen put fine outline boughs letter taking care far possible put outline within edge shade make boughs thicker main use outline affirm whole clearly away little accidental roughnesses excrescences especially mark boughs cross come front points arrangement kind sketch unintelligible without outline 
may perfectly well happen nature less distinct outline make better kind sketch mark facts clearly 
temptation always slovenly careless outline like bridle forces indolence attention precision 
outline thickness fig 
represents ramification small stone pine endeavored represent pencil shading within outline could easily express wood cut nothing present indication foliage another place 
may also draw trees much larger figure like however large may keep outline delicate draw branches far enough outer sprays give quite slender ramification figure otherwise get good enough practice 
illustration fig 


many studies kind every one give new notion trees 
tired tree boughs take forms whatever drawn flat color one upon another patterns kind cloth flat china tiles instance executed two colors practice drawing right shape size eye filling shade depth required 
first meet difficulty representing depth color depth shade 
thus pattern ultramarine blue represented darker tint gray pattern yellow 

time begin learn mechanical use brush necessary order provide gradated scale color want 
means get acquainted ordinary skillful water color painter prevail show lay tints brush means yet long yet begin color brush often convenient pencil laying masses tints shade sooner know manage instrument better 
however opportunity seeing water color laid workman kind following directions help exercise vii 

get shilling cake prussian blue 
dip end water take drop rub white saucer till rub much color gets dark thick oily looking 
put two teaspoonfuls water color rubbed mix well camel hair brush three quarters inch long 

take piece smooth glossy bristol board pasteboard divide pencil rule squares large largest chess board need perfect squares nearly quickly guess 
rest pasteboard something sloping much ordinary desk dipping brush color mixed taking much liquid carry begin top one squares lay pond runlet color along top edge 
lead pond color gradually downwards faster one place another adding row bricks building along building instead dipping brush frequently keep color full great quantity paper run anywhere little stream 
never mind go quietly square till covered 
get bottom color lodge great wave 
ready piece blotting paper dry brush dry brush take superfluous color would sponge till looks even 

leading color find brush continually go edge square leave little gaps within 
endeavor retouch take much care great thing get color lie smoothly reaches alternate blots pale patches try therefore lead square fast possible attention limit able give 
use exercise indeed enable finally strike color limit perfect accuracy first thing get even power rightly striking edge comes time practice even greatest artists rarely quite perfectly 

done one square proceed another communicate 
thus done alternate squares chess board turn pasteboard upside begin first put another coat others 
use turning paper upside neutralize increase darkness towards bottom squares would otherwise take place ponding color 

resolved use blotting paper piece rag instead lips dry brush 
habit acquired save much partial poisoning 
take care however always draw brush root point otherwise spoil 
may even wipe would pen want dry without harm provided crush upwards 
get good brush first cherish serve longer better many bad ones 

done squares third time always trying keep edges neat possible 
color exhausted mix proportions two teaspoonfuls much grind drop done alternate squares three times paper getting damp dry slowly begin white squares bring tint way 
amount jagged dark line mark limits squares exact measure unskillfulness 

soon tire squares draw circles compasses draw straight lines irregularly across circles fill spaces produced straight line circumference draw simple shapes leaves according exercise 
ii fill lay color quite evenly shape want 

find course practice always put exactly quantity water color darker color difficult becomes lay evenly 
therefore gained definite degree power try fill forms required full brush dark tint instead laying several coats one another always taking care tint however dark quite liquid laid much absorbed prevent forming black line edge dries 
little experience teach apt color prevent needs always prevented great master water colors sometimes draw firm outline wants one simply letting color dry way edge 

however begin cover complicated forms darker color rapidity prevent tint drying irregularly led part part 
find following method useful 
lay color pale liquid pale indeed see paper 
lead outlines make precise form keeping thoroughly wet everywhere 
shape take darker color lay middle liquid color 
spread gradually branchy kind way may lead outlines already determined play brush till fills place well let dry flat pure single dash yet defining complicated forms accurately 

thus obtained power laying tolerably flat tint must try lay gradated one 
prepare color three four teaspoonfuls water mixed pour away two thirds keeping teaspoonful pale color 
sloping paper draw two pencil lines way leaving space width square chess board 
begin top paper lines struck first brushful color led little dip brush deep water mix color plate quickly much water brush takes one dip paler color lead tint farther 
dip water mix color thus lead tint always dipping water replenishing brush stirring color plate well quickly 
go color become pale see wash brush thoroughly water carry wave little farther absorb dry brush leave dry 

get bottom paper color gets pale may either take longer paper begin tint left another sheet sure exhaust pure whiteness last 
quite dry recommence top another similar mixture color go way 
continually color top paper dark cake prussian blue passes pure white paper end column perfectly smooth gradation one 

find first paper gets mottled wavy instead evenly gradated places taken water brush others mixed thoroughly plate led one tint far replenishing next 
practice enable well best artists always get gradations kind quite minds ever leave pictures without touching 

get power strike color quickly able gradate less compass beginning small quantity color adding drop water instead brushful finer brushes also may gradate less scale 
slight skill enable test relations color shade far necessary immediate progress done thus 
take cakes lake gamboge sepia blue black cobalt vermilion prepare gradated columns exactly done prussian blue lake blue black 
cut narrow slip way gradated color set three slips side side fasten rule lines equal distances across three divide fifty degrees number degrees light dark etc 
gradated rightly darkest part either red blue nearly equal power darkest part blue black degree black slip also accurately enough purpose balance weight degree similarly numbered red blue slip 
drawing objects crimson blue color match color compartment crimson blue scales gray compartment gray scale marked number gray must represent crimson blue light shade drawing 

next prepare scales gamboge cobalt vermilion 
find darken beyond certain point yellow scarlet long remain yellow scarlet approach black properly speaking dark yellow dark scarlet 
make scales full yellow blue scarlet half way passing gradually white 
afterwards use lake darken upper half vermilion gamboge prussian blue darken cobalt 
thus three scales passing white nearly black yellow orange sky blue scarlet 
mixing gamboge prussian blue may make another green mixing cobalt lake another violet sepia alone make forcible brown one many scales like passing black white different colors 
supposing scales properly gradated equally divided compartment degree gray represent chiaroscuro colors gray 
colors 

necessary however matter understand principle would never possible gradate scales truly make practically accurate serviceable even could unless ten thousand scales able change faster ever juggler changed cards could day measure tints much one side frost bitten apple 
fully understand principle see colors contain certain quantity darkness power dark relief white less pitch power may represented equivalent values gray soon able arrive shrewdly approximation glance eye without measuring scale 

must go pen drawing patterns shapes shade think pretty veinings marble tortoiseshell spots surfaces shells etc tenderly darknesses correspond colors find successfully time begin rounding 
exercise viii 

go garden road pick first round oval stone find white dark smoother better must shine 
draw table near window put stone suppose size fig 
better much larger piece white paper table front 
sit light may come left else shadow pencil point interferes sight work 
must let sun fall stone ordinary light therefore choose window sun come 
shut shutters windows room better much consequence 

draw stone draw anything mean anything drawable 
many things sea foam instance drawn idea less suggested draw stone rightly everything within reach art also within 
drawing depends primarily power representing roundness 
rest easy straightforward nothing else may able use 
nature made roundnesses roundness perfect globes variously curved surfaces 
boughs rounded leaves rounded stones rounded clouds rounded cheeks rounded curls rounded flatness natural world vacancy 
world round less except human work often flat indeed 
illustration fig 

therefore set steadily conquer round stone battle 

look stone antagonist boldly face 
see side next window lighter paper side farthest window darker paper light passes dark gradually shadow thrown right paper stone general appearance things less fig 
spots stone excepted presently 

remember always stated outset everything see nature seen far lighter darker things different color 
either seen patch one color ground another pale thing relieved dark thing dark thing pale thing 
put patches color shade exactly size shape gradations object ground produce appearance object ground 
best draughtsman titian paul veronese could soon able get power inferior way understand exceeding simplicity done 
suppose brown book white sheet paper red tablecloth 
nothing put spaces red white brown shape gradated dark light degrees drawing done 
look see try put brighter duller colors try put dash blot cover paper vigorous lines produce anything fact plain unaffected finished tranquillity thing need hope get 
nature show nothing set master 
forget try obey find obedience easier happier think 

real difficulties get refinement forms evenness gradations 
may depend upon dissatisfied work always coarse uneven 
may wrong probability wrong called great point 
edges true enough outline shades blotches scratches full white holes 
get tender true find powerful 

therefore think drawing must weak finely pointed pen hand 
till draw draw nothing draw draw log wood charred end 
true boldness power gained care 
even fencing dancing ultimate ease depends early precision commencement much singing drawing 

want copy sketch fig 
copy stone way sketch done 
end first measure extreme length stone compasses mark length paper points marked leave something like form stone light scrawling paper round b fig 
beginning kind 
rather leave much room high light little cautiously fill shade shutting light gradually putting dark slowly dark side 
need plague accuracy shape till practiced great deal impossible draw shape stone quite truly must gradually gain correctness means various exercises mainly present get stone look solid round much minding exact contor draw nearly right without vexation get right thus feeling way shade tried draw outline first 
see outline see certain space gradated shade spaces pieces shade imitate nearly scrawling paper till get right shape gradations nature 
really likely done well fight way little confusion sketch accurately traced outline 
instance sketched fossil sea urchin fig 
whose form though irregular required care following common stone going draw also another effect reflected light bringing dark side background laid first touches thought would better stop let see begun b 
beginning observed nothing determined less modify add diminish contor work lines suggest outline blended others want fill vacancies conquer irregularities sketch probably secure higher completion last half hour spent getting true outline beginning 

however take care get drawing dark 
order ascertain shades really cut round hole half size pea piece white paper color use draw 
hold bit paper hole stone pass paper backwards forwards see different portions stone subject hole 
find thus circular hole looks like one patches color accustomed match changing depth lets different pieces stone seen 
able thus actually match color stone part tinting paper beside circular opening 
find opening never looks quite black roundings stone given subdued grays 

probably find also parts stone paper lies look luminous opening little circle tells light spot instead dark spot 
imitate means getting light brighter white paper holding paper sloped towards light find many parts stone looked light hole look dark place paper position every part stone looks slightly dark little hole tell always spot shade drawing put light imitate match every gradation 
amazed find circumstances slight differences tint infinite delicacy gradation nature express form 
part subject obstinately show light hole part need hope imitate 
leave white 

done best get general form proceed finish imitating texture cracks stains stone closely note cracks fissures kind whether stones walls grain timber rocks thousand conditions present never expressible single black lines lines simple shadow 
crack must always complete system light shade however small scale 
reality little ravine dark shady side light sunny side usually shadow bottom 
one instances may well understand reason appearance often drawing aspects things subtle confused general explained endeavor explain sure lose sight others natural overestimate importance attention fixed causes us exaggerate merely scientific draughtsmen caricature third part nature miss two thirds 
best scholar whose eye keen see thing looks need therefore trouble reasons looks people acuteness perception destitute little pointing rule reason help especially master near 
never allow pupils ask reason anything watch work always show thing appearance missing master direct sight science may allowed stead 

generally every solid illumined object instance stone drawing light side turned towards light dark side turned away light shadow cast something else stone paper set upon 
may sometimes placed see light side shadow sometimes dark side shadow sometimes either without shadow positions solid objects show three stone 

hold hand edge towards sit side window flat hand turned window 
see one side hand distinctly lighted distinctly shade 
light side dark side seen shadow shadow detached perhaps table perhaps side room need look present 

take sheet note paper holding edgewise hold hand wave past side hand turned light paper course farther window 
see passes strong gleam light strike hand light considerably dark side 
light reflected light 
thrown back paper strikes first coming window surface hand ball would somebody threw window wall caught rebound 
next instead note paper take red book piece scarlet cloth 
see gleam light falling hand wave book reddened 
take blue book find gleam blue 
thus every object cast color back light reflects 

books papers reflect light hand every object room side reflects feebly colors mixing together form neutral light lets color hand distinctly seen object reflects light reflected light side hand would look black coal 

objects seen therefore general partly direct light partly light reflected objects around atmosphere clouds 
color light sides depends much direct light dark sides colors objects near 
therefore impossible say beforehand color object point surface color depending partly tint partly infinite combinations rays reflected things 
certain fact dark sides color changeful picture gives merely darker shades color light sides must assuredly bad 

lay hand flat white paper drawing 
see one side finger lighted one side dark shadow hand paper 
therefore three divisions shade seen 
although paper white hand rosy color somewhat darker white yet see shadow along finger casts darker flesh deep gray

lighter faster every dash better 
leave whole dry soon dry little color brush bring fine point fill little interstices one one make whole even fill larger gaps color always trying let edges first newly applied color exactly meet lap 
new color dries find places little paler first

exercise observe well repeat frequently whether get prints drawings well photographs 

last copy piece liber studiorum photographic substitute faithfully complete means power working nature subjects interest four different ways 
first 
full time subject one stay quiet make perfect light shade studies nearly perfect gray brown color kind reinforced defined pen 

secondly 
time short subject rich detail feel complete intelligibly light shade make hasty study effect give rest time reresque expression details 
subject seems interesting points understand try get five spare minutes go close make nearer memorandum ever bring details nearer sketch farther one may thus perfect experience aspect things know look tower cottage five hundred yards means sort tower cottage near also nearer sketch useful prevent future misinterpretation work 
time however far light shade study distance may carried always well reasons make also reresque near memoranda light shade drawing good much interesting detail must lost disguised 

hasty study effect may made easily quickly soft pencil dashed done one tolerably deep tone gray fix pencil 
fixing color wet take higher lights dry brush quite dry scratch highest lights penknife 
five minutes carefully applied much means 
course paper white 
like studies gray paper well get gradation taking wet tint laying cunningly little darker body color white unless consummately skillful 
objection making reresque memoranda gray yellow paper touching relieving white depend much white touches make sketch sake 

thirdly 
neither time careful study reresque detail sketch outline pencil dash shadows brush boldly trying much possibly get habit expedition decision laying color tints dry using every expedient practice suggested carrying chiaroscuro manageable moist material taking color dry brush scratching lights wooden handle brush rubbing fingers drying sponge etc 
color take pen mark outline characters vigorously manner liber studiorum 
kind study convenient carrying away pieces effect depend much refinement complexity strange shapes involved shadows sudden effects sky etc useful safeguard servile slow habits minute copying may induce although endeavor obtain velocity merely velocity sake dash display sake baneful despicable velocity dash compatible perfect drawing obtain certain results otherwise 
perfectly safe study occasionally speed decision continual course practice insure retaining accurate judgment tender touch 
speed circumstances rather fatiguing tempting find always beguiled rather elaboration negligence

fourthly 
find great use whatever kind landscape scenery passing get habit making memoranda shapes shadows 
find many objects essential interest neither deserving finished study reresque one may yet become singular value consequence fantastic shapes shadows happens often distant effect shadow much important element substance 
thus alpine bridge fig

saw still greater distances would appear fig 
b c diminishing last strange unintelligible spider like spot gray light hill side 
perfectly great painter throughout distances continually reduces objects shadow abstracts singular many persons unaccountable effect confused touches turner distances owing chiefly thorough accuracy intense meaning shadow abstracts 
illustration fig 


studies kind easily made haste f hb 
pencil requires hardness point insure drawing delicately enough forms shadows subtle sure somewhere generally everywhere 
pencil indeed precious instrument master pen brush pencil cunningly used draw line precision one gradation nevertheless unsatisfactory see sharp touches best detail depends getting gradually deadened time find places force wanted look shiny like fire grate recommend rather steady use pen brush color whenever time admits keeping small memorandum book breast pocket well cut sheathed pencil ready notes passing opportunities never without 

thus much respecting manner first draw nature 
may perhaps serviceable also note one two points respecting choice subjects study best special methods treating one means least difficulties first encounter peculiar instinct common far noticed beginners fix exactly unmanageable feature given scene 
many things every landscape drawn accomplished artists noticed nearly always beginner dash something though pleasing unfit picture drawn little pleasure 
slight protection evil genius beginners following general warnings may useful 

draw things love account associations least draw love merely get anything else draw 
try draw places love sure always entangled amongst neat brick walls iron railings gravel walks greenhouses quickset hedges besides continually led endeavor make drawing pretty complete fatal progress 
need never hope get least anxious drawing actually work upon look nice done 
care make right learn much possible 
though sitting friend parlor nothing else may draw anything practice even fire irons pattern carpet sure practice beloved carpet friendly poker tongs wish please friend drawing room 

also never make presents drawings 
course addressing beginner time may come work precious everybody resolute give away till know worth something soon worth anything know 
one asks present drawing send couple cakes color piece bristol board materials present value form spread one 
main reason rule however observance much protect great danger trying make drawings pretty 


never choice draw anything polished especially complicated form 
avoid brass rods curtain ornaments chandeliers plate glass fine steel 
shining knob piece furniture matter comes way fret look right choose things shine 

avoid neat things 
exceedingly difficult draw ugly drawn 
choose rough worn clumsy looking things much possible instance difficult profitless study newly painted thames wherry better study old empty coal barge lying ashore low tide general everything think ugly good draw 

avoid much possible studies one thing seen another 
constantly find thin tree standing chosen cottage turn river near branches entangled distance 
intensely difficult represent though tree must imaginarily cut well yet always look subjects fall definite masses network rather cottage dark tree beside one thin tree front rather mass wood soft blue rounded ragged copse confusion intricate stems 

avoid far possible country divided hedges 
perhaps nothing whole compass landscape utterly unpicturesque unmanageable ordinary english patchwork field hedge trees dotted independent spots gnawed straight cattle line 
still discouraged find chosen ill subject overmasters 
much better think entirely mastered 
first even time must prepared discomfortable failure nevertheless without wholesome result 

however told definitely avoid may perhaps help little saying seek 
general banks beautiful things reward work better large landscapes 
live lowland country must look places ground broken river edges decayed posts roots trees great good luck things within reach remnants stone quays steps mossy mill dams etc 
nearly every mile road chalk country present beautiful bits broken bank sides better form color high chalk cliffs

scenes avenue seine recommended buy engraving admit rivalship expression graceful rusticity cheerful peace beauty component lines 
drawing villages take great pains gardens rustic garden every way beautiful 
time draw rows cabbages hollyhocks broken fences wandering eglantines bossy roses better practice kept anything purer thoughts

village churches england often good subjects peculiar meanness awkwardness line 
old manor houses often pretty

think single cathedral england possible obtain one subject impressive drawing 
always discordant civility jarring vergerism 

live mountain hill country danger redundance subject 
resolved first place draw piece rounded rock variegated lichens quite rightly getting complete roundings patterns lichen true local color 
till use thinking sketching among hills done forms distant hills comparatively easy 

practiced little time subjects may accessible certainly find difficulties arising make wish ever master help difficulties vary according character mind one question occurring one person one another impossible anticipate would make large book answered anticipate must content work good hope nature time interpret much farther experience part make difficulties disappear others removed occasional observation artists work may come way 
nevertheless close letter without general remarks may useful somewhat advanced power remarks may think conveniently arranged three heads reference drawing vegetation water skies 

first vegetation 
may think perhaps said enough trees already yet done bid tried draw frequently enough carefully enough ready time hear little 
also recollect left question respecting mode expressing intricacy leafage partly unsettled first letter 
left wanted learn real structure leaves drawing troubled subtle considerations method drawing 
time imagine must found two principal things universal facts leaves namely always main tendencies lines indicate beautiful divergence growth according law radiation already referred second divergence never formal carried endless variety individual line 
must press facts attention little farther 

may perhaps surprised yet spoken works j harding especially happen met passages referring modern painters highly praised 
deservedly praised works modern draughtsman express wise energy trees laws growth speaking 
lithographic sketches truth general character obtained little cost time rival harding calame robert lithographic landscape sketchers altogether inferior power though sometimes little deeper meaning 
must take even harding model though may use works occasional reference afford buy lessons trees serviceable various ways present help explain point consideration

perfect acknowledgment expression three laws good drawing landscape consists 
first organic unity law whether radiation parallelism concurrent action rules masses herbs trees rocks clouds waves secondly individual liberty members subjected laws unity lastly mystery separate character less concealed 
say first must observance ruling organic law 
first distinction good artists bad artists 
common sketcher bad painter puts leaves trees moss tied sticks see lines action growth scatters shapeless clouds sky perceiving sweeps associated curves real clouds following fly breaks mountain side rugged fragments wholly unconscious lines force real rocks risen lines couch repose 
contrary main delight great draughtsman trace laws government tendency error always exaggeration authority rather denial 

secondly say show individual character liberty separate leaves clouds rocks 
herein great masters separate finally inferior ones men inferior genius ever express law sacrifice individuality 
thus salvator rosa great perception sweep foliage rolling clouds never draws single leaflet mist wreath accurately 
similarly gainsborough landscape great feeling masses form harmony color detail gives nothing meaningless touches even much species tree much less variety leafage ever discernible 
although expressions government individuality essential masterly work individuality essential difficult attainment therefore attainment separates great masters finally inferior ones 
essential matters beautiful arrangement visible things rules hold hold moral things 
lamentable unnatural thing see number men subject government actuated ruling principle associated common affection would lamentable thing still possible see number men oppressed assimilation individual hope character differences aim dissimilarities passion irregularities judgment society man could help another since none would feebler man admire another since none would stronger man grateful another since none could relieved man reverence another since none could instructed society every soul would syllable stammerer instead word speaker every man would walk frightful dream seeing specters everlasting multiplication gliding helplessly around speechless darkness 
therefore perpetual difference play change groups form essential even subdued great gathering law law needful perfection power difference needful life 

may noted passing enjoy pursuit analogies types ingenuity judgment discerning may always accurately ascertain noble characters piece painting merely considering noble characters man association fellows 
grace manner refinement habit society grace line refinement form association visible objects 
advantage harm may sharpness ruggedness quaintness dealings conversations men precisely relative degree advantage harm elements pictorial composition 
power liberty relaxation strengthen relieve human souls power precisely relative degree play laxity line strengthen refresh expression picture 
goodness greatness conceive arise companies men chastity thought regularity life simplicity custom balance authority precisely kind goodness greatness may given picture purity color severity forms symmetry masses 

need least afraid pushing analogies far

affection discord fretfulness quietness feebleness firmness luxury purity pride modesty habits every conceivable modification mingling may illustrated mathematical exactness conditions line color merely definable vices virtues also every conceivable shade human character passion righteous unrighteous majesty king innocent faultful simplicity shepherd boy 

pursuit subject belongs properly however investigation higher branches composition matters would quite useless treat book allude order may understand utmost noblenesses art concerned minute work set beginning 
closest attention noble execution possible express varieties individual character excellence portraiture depends whether masses mankind groups leaves 

able understand among matters wherein consists excellence wherein shortcoming tree drawing harding 
excellent far fondly observes truth work kind great laws growth action trees fails observe minor principal point rightly render one individual detail incident foliage 
fails mere carelessness incompletion necessity true drawing detail evermore impossible hand contracted habit execution 
noble draughtsman draws leaf stops says calmly leaf character give friend entirely suit considers friend ought determined draws friend 
process may quick lightning master great one sons giants may slow timid process always gone touch form ever added another good painter without mental determination affirmation 
hand got habit leaf necessitates leaf stop hand horse bit teeth rather time machine throwing leaves order pattern alike 
must stop hand however painfully make understand way shall never slip one touch another without orders otherwise master fingers 
may therefore study harding drawing take pleasure may properly admire dexterity applies habit hand well produces results whole satisfactory must never copy otherwise progress arrested 
utmost ever hope would sketch harding manner far inferior dexterity given life toil gain dexterity suppose things work besides drawing 
would also incapacitate ever understanding truly great work nature earnest complete study facts gradually come understand one love whether draw well 

yet say words respecting third law stated mystery law namely nothing ever seen perfectly fragments various conditions obscurity 
last fact renders visible objects nature complete type human nature 
observe first subordination secondly individuality lastly least essential character incomprehensibility perpetual lesson every serrated point shining vein escapes deceives sight among forest leaves little may hope discern clearly judge justly rents veins human heart much round us men actions spirits first think understand closer loving watchfulness would show full mystery never either fathomed withdrawn

expression final character landscape never completely reached except turner hope reach given much time practice art

second place consider little modes representing water important feature landscape hardly said anything yet 
water expressed common drawings conventional lines whose horizontality supposed convey idea surface 
paintings white dashes bars light used purpose 
expedients vain absurd

give time necessary draw reflections disturbing see breeze current disturb get effect water patience draw reflections expedient give true effect 
picture pool needs nearly much delicate drawing picture pool except least motion water horizontal lines images diffused broken vertical ones remain decisive oblique ones decisive proportion steepness 

close studies soon teach thing need told watch carefully lines disturbance surface bird swims across fish rises current plays round stone reed obstacle 
take greatest pains get curves lines true whole value careful drawing reflections may lost admitting single false curve ripple wild duck breast

taking pains work softer reflections drawn motion water touches nearly horizontal may hurry indicate place play images vertical lines

instinct eye nothing else 

little study nature get puzzled great differences aspect reflected image object casting wish know law reflection simply suppose objects water actually reversed appearance fact beneath water precisely form relative position topsy turvy 
whatever could see place stand solid objects reversed water see reflection always true perspective solid objects reversed 
quite understand looking water take mirror lay horizontally table put books papers upon draw reflections moving watching reflections alter chiefly reflected colors shades differ colors shades brought oppositions

look water better see objects look along eye low see reflection objects 
hence color given space surface stream entirely change stand still spot merely stoop raise head thus colors water painted indication position spectator connected inseparably perspective shores 
beautiful results know mountain streams water shallow stones bottom rich reddish orange black water seen angle exactly divides visible colors stones sky sky clear full blue 
resulting purple obtained blending blue orange red broken play innumerable gradations stones indescribably lovely 

seems complicated enough already strong color clear water green blue swiss lakes phenomena doubly involved darker reflections become color water 
reflection black gondola instance venice never black pure dark green 
farther color water three kinds one seen surface kind milky bloom next seen waves let light edges third shown change color objects seen water 
thus wave makes white object look clear blue seen take red violet colored bloom surface made pure emerald green transmitted sunshine edges 
however much concerned present tell partly preparation afterwards say color partly may approach lakes streams reverence study carefully things hoping express horizontal dashes white tremulous blots

ought love color think nothing quite beautiful perfect without really love sake merely desirous color think painting finer thing drawing chance may color well 
nevertheless need hope ever produce anything pleasant helps memory useful suggestive sketches color unless mean wholly artist 
may time vocations leave disposal produce finished beautiful masterly drawings light shade

hear said body color looks chalky opaque likely think yet assured though certain effects glow transparencies gloom reached without transparent color glows glooms noblest aim art 
many years study various results fresco oil painting italy body color transparent color england entirely convinced greatest things done art must done dead color 
habit depending varnish lucid tints transparency makes painter comparatively lose sight nobler translucence obtained breaking various colors amidst even correggio exquisite play hue joined exquisite transparency delight depth almost always leads painter mean false chiaroscuro leads like dark backgrounds instead luminous ones enjoy general quality color grandeur composition confined light rather open sunshine really greatest thoughts greatest men always far remember reached dead color noblest oil pictures tintoret veronese likest frescoes 

besides fact though sometimes little chalky coarse looking body color sketch infinitely liker nature transparent color bloom mist distance accurately instantly represented film opaque blue quite accurately think nothing else ground rocks buildings earthy solid surface course always truer finished carefully wrought work transparent tints ever 

one thing however must steadily caution 
kinds color equally illegitimate think allow alter pleasure blunder ease 
vehicle method color admits alteration repentance must right never might well hope catch rifle bullet hand put straight going wrong recover tint spoiled

drawing body color tend teach method prevent falling pestilent habit sponging get texture trick nearly ruined modern water color school art 
sometimes places skillful artist roughen paper little get certain conditions dusty color ease could otherwise sometimes skillfully rased piece paper midst transparent tints answer nearly purpose chalky body color representing surfaces rocks building 
artifices kind always treacherous tyro hands tempting trust better always work white gray paper smooth silk never disturb surface color paper except finally scratch highest lights using transparent colors 

said body color drawing teach use color better working merely transparent tints process easier one complete one also involves working transparent tints best way 
think use body color may make kind mess like yet get 
avail characters material enable nearly imitate processes nature 
thus suppose red rocky cliff sketch blue clouds floating 
paint cliff first firmly take blue mixing tint great part skill needed laid red thickness required effect mist warm rock color showing blue cloud color may bring exactly hue want upper tint therefore must mixed colder want lay varying strike getting forms mist rightly done exquisite quality color warm tint showing particles

whenever lay mass color sure however large may however small shall gradated 
color exists nature ordinary circumstances without gradation 
see fault inexperience see due time practice enough 
general may see 
birch trunk instance rosy gray must gradated roundness stem till meets shaded side similarly shaded side gradated reflected light 
accordingly whether adding water white paint unequal force touch pleasure according texture wish produce must every tint lay make little paler one part another get even gradation two depths 
like laying formal law recipe find merely assertion natural fact 
indeed physically impossible meet ungradated piece color supremely improbable better get habit asking invariably going copy tint gradated way gradated least ninety nine hundred instances able answer decisively careful glance though gradation may subtle see first 
matter small touch color may though larger smallest pin head one part darker rest bad touch merely natural fact color gradated preciousness pleasantness color depends qualities gradation colors curvature lines felt beautiful pure instinct every human mind considered types expressing law gradual change progress human soul 
difference mere beauty gradated ungradated color may seen easily laying even tint rose color paper putting rose leaf beside 
victorious beauty rose compared flowers depends wholly delicacy quantity color gradations flowers either less rich gradation many folds leaf less tender patched veined instead flushed 


observe enough general color gradated made merely paler darker one place another 
generally color changes diminishes merely darker one spot also purer one spot anywhere else 
least follow darkest spots purest still less lightest purest 
often two gradations less cross one passing one direction paleness darkness another another direction purity dullness almost always however reconciled must never satisfied piece color got say every piece blue lay must quite blue given spot large spot must gradated less pure blue grayish blue greenish blue purplish blue rest space occupies 
must one three ways either color wet mix color subdue adding gradually little little else color quite dry strike gradated touch another color leaving point first tint visible else lay subduing tints small touches exercise tinting chess board 
methods something tell separately distinct subject gradation must quit without pressing upon pre minent necessity introducing everywhere 
profound dislike anything like habit hand yet one instance feel almost tempted encourage get habit never touching paper color without securing gradation 
turner largest oil pictures perhaps six seven feet long four five high find one spot color large grain wheat ungradated find practice brilliancy hue vigor light even aspect transparency shade essentially dependent character alone hardness coldness opacity resulting far equality color nature color 
give mud city crossing ocher gravel pit little whitening coal dust paint luminous picture give time gradate mud subdue dust though red ruby blue gentian snow light amber gold paint luminous picture keep masses colors unbroken purity unvarying depth 


next note three processes gradation characters obtained mixing color wet 
may confused first telling lay hues separate patches telling mix hues together lay separate masses laid colors distinctly oppose given limit hues mixed palpitate one fade one 
better err little distinct side 
thus told paint dark light sides birch trunk separately though reality two tints change trunk turns away light gradually one laid separately need farther touching harmonize narrow space marked distinctly way trunk easier safer therefore keep separate first 
whereas often happens whole beauty two colors depend one continued well playing midst blue green often water blue gray purple scarlet sky hundreds instances beautiful truthful results may obtained laying one color wet judging wisely far spread blending brush somewhat thicker consistence wet body color observe never mix way two mixtures let color lay always simple compound tint 

b laying one color another 
lay solid touch vermilion quite dry strike little wet carmine quickly obtain much brilliant red mixing carmine vermilion 
similarly lay dark color first strike little blue white body color lightly get beautiful gray mixing color blue white 
perfect painting artifices kind continually used would trust much apt make think much quality color 
like depend little dead colors simply laid observe always less color work better always laid red color want purple one mix purple palette lay thick overpower red take little thin blue palette lay lightly red let red seen thus produce required purple want green hue blue one lay quantity green blue little yellow always bringing color service far possibly 
however color beneath wholly opposed one lay suppose green laid scarlet must either remove required parts color daintily first knife water else lay solid white massively leave dry glaze white upper color 
better general laying upper color thick conquer ground fact transparent color 
thus strike warm boughs leaves trees blue sky intricate places left laying blue better lay first solid white glaze sienna ocher mix sienna white though course process longer troublesome 
nevertheless forms touches required delicate glazing impossible 
must mix warm color thick use often necessary delicate grasses fine threads light foreground work 

c breaking one color small points another 
important processes good modern oil water color painting need hope attain great skill 
well laborious requires skill delicacy hand acquired unceasing practice 
find advantage noting following points 
distant effects rich subject wood rippled water broken clouds much may done touches crumbling dashes rather dry color colors afterwards put cunningly interstices 
practice subject evidently calls eye enjoy higher qualities color 
process fact carrying principle separate colors utmost possible refinement using atoms color juxtaposition instead large spaces 
note filling minute interstices kind want color fill show brightly better put rather positive point little white left beside round interstice put pale tint color whole interstice 
yellow orange hardly show pale small spaces show brightly firm touches however small white beside 

b color darkened superimposed portions another many cases better lay uppermost color rather vigorous small touches like finely chopped straw one lay tint two reasons first play two colors together pleasant eye second much expression form may got wise administration upper dark touches 
distant mountains may made pines broken crags villages stones whatever choose clouds may indicate direction rain roll outline cloud masses water minor waves 
noble effects dark atmosphere got good water color drawing two expedients interlacing colors retouching lower one fine darker drawing upper 
sponging washing dark atmospheric effect barbarous mere tyro work though often useful passages delicate atmospheric light 

c time practice production mixed tints interlaced touches pure colors formed use process parts sketches wish get rich luscious effects 
study works william hunt old water color society respect continually make frequent memoranda variegations flowers painting flower completely laying ground color one petal painting spots studious precision series single petals lilies geraniums tulips etc numbered proper reference position flower interesting many grounds besides art 
careful get gradated distribution spots well followed calceolarias foxgloves like work odd indefinite hues spots minute grains pure interlaced color otherwise never get richness bloom 
surprised find first universality law gradation much insisted upon secondly nature economical fine colors told 
would think way paints colors cost something enormous give single pure touch petal turns light bell subdued petal subdued even showiest flower 
thought bright blue look close dusty gray green purple every color world single gleam streak pure blue center 
colors 
sometimes really thought miserliness intolerable gentian instance way economizes ultramarine bell little bad 

next respecting general tone 
said sake students tax laid black white pigments mean colorist must lay tax begin use true color say must use little make much 
better test color tones good made white picture precious black conspicuous 

say first white precious 
mean merely glittering brilliant easy scratch white seagulls black clouds dot clumsy foliage chalky dew white well managed ought strangely delicious tender well bright like inlaid mother pearl white roses washed milk 
eye ought seek rest brilliant though may feel space strange heavenly paleness midst flushing colors 
effect reach general depth middle tint absolutely refusing allow white exist except need keeping white subdued gray except points chief luster 

secondly must make black conspicuous 
however small point black may ought catch eye otherwise work heavy shadow 
ordinary shadows color never black approaching black evidently always luminous nature black look strange among never occurring except black object small points indicative intense shade center masses shadow 
shadows absolutely negative gray however may beautifully used white gold still though black thus subdued strength becomes spacious always conspicuous spectator notice gray neutrality wonder enjoy intensely account gold color white relieves 
great colorists velasquez greatest master black chords 
black precious people crimson 

however white black must make valuable must give rare worth every color use white black ought separate quaintly rest colors continually passing one evidently companions gay world white black neutral gray stand monkishly aloof midst 
may melt crimson purple purple blue blue green must melt black 
however try said give preciousness colors especially never using grain work giving hue highest value opposition 
fine coloring like fine drawing delicate delicate last see color putting putting much 
ought feel change wrought general tone touches color individually pale seen one atom color whole picture unnecessary atom hurts 

notice also nearly good compound colors odd colors 
shall look hue good painter work ten minutes know call 
thought brown presently feel red next somehow yellow presently afterwards blue 
try copy always find color warm cold color box seem affinity yet pure laid single touch single color 

choice harmony colors general choose harmonize instinct never 
need examples utterly harsh horrible color may find plenty given treatises upon coloring illustrate laws harmony want color beautifully color best pleases quiet times catch eye look clever difficult color way color may pleasant happy thoughtful 
look much morning evening sky much simple flowers dog roses wood hyacinths violets poppies thistles heather like nature arranges woods fields 
ever scientific person tells two colors discordant make note two colors put together whenever 
actually heard people say blue green discordant two colors nature seems intend never separated never felt either full beauty without peacock neck blue sky green leaves blue wave green lights precisely loveliest things next clouds sunrise colored world 
good eye colors soon find constantly nature puts purple green together purple scarlet green blue yellow neutral gray like strikes color concords general tones works innumerable subordinate ones gradually come like find new beautiful chords color work every day 
enjoy depend upon paint certain point right least enjoy certain paint wrong 
color give intense pleasure let alone depend upon tormenting eyes senses people feel color whenever touch unkind improper 

find also power coloring depend much state health right balance mind fatigued ill see colors well ill tempered choose well thus though infallibly test character individuals color power great sign mental health nations state intellectual decline coloring always gets dull 
must also take great care misled affected talk colors people gift numbers eager voluble probably never lives received one genuine color sensation 
modern religionists school overbeck like people eat slate pencil chalk assure everybody nicer purer strawberries plums 

take care also never misled idea color help display form color always disguises form meant 

favorite dogma among modern writers color warm colors reds yellows approach express nearness cold colors blue gray retire express distance 
far case expression distance world great gold orange twilight sky 
colors absolutely inexpressive respecting distance 
quality depth delicacy etc expresses distance tint 
blue bandbox set shelf yellow one look inch farther red orange cloud upper sky always appear beyond blue cloud close us reality 
quite true certain objects blue sign distance blue retiring color mist air blue therefore warm color strength light enough pierce mist lost subdued blue blue account retiring color brown retiring color stones seen brown water deeper lie browner look yellow retiring color objects seen london fog farther yellower look 
neither blue yellow red smallest power expressing either nearness distance express peculiar circumstances render moment place signs nearness distance 
thus vivid orange orange sign nearness put orange great way color look bright vivid orange sky sign distance get color orange cloud near 
purple violet hyacinth sign nearness closer look purple see 
purple mountain sign distance mountain close purple green gray 
may indeed generally assumed tender pale color less express distance powerful dark color nearness even always 
heathery hills usually give pale tender purple near intense dark purple far away rose color sunset snow pale snow feet deep full snow distance green swiss lake pale clear waves beach intense emerald sunstreak six miles shore 
case foreground strong light much water white surface casting intense reflections colors may perfectly delicate pale faint distance shadow may relieve whole foreground intense darks purple blue green ultramarine blue 
whole quite hopeless absurd expect help laws rial perspective 
look natural effects set fully faithfully never alter color look right place 
put color strong strong though far faint faint though close 
suppose nature always means know exactly far one thing another certainly intends always enjoy coloring wish always measure space 
would hard put every time painted sun setting express miles distance rial perspective 

however think one law distance claims considered constant one namely dullness heaviness color less indicative nearness 
distant color pure color may bright clear lovely opaque soiled air light coming us earthy imperfect color purify harmonize hence bad colorist peculiarly incapable expressing distance 
course mean use bad colors foreground way making come forward failure color put place failure color distance away remoteness dull colored foreground still foreground though ill painted ill painted distance merely dull distance distance 

one thing advise namely never color petulantly hurriedly 
indeed able attend properly coloring get anything like quantity form could chiaroscuro sketch nevertheless dash rush work lazily may always get enough form satisfactory 
extra quarter hour distributed quietness course whole study may make difference quite intelligible drawing slovenly obscure one 
determine well beforehand outline piece color paper guide without nervousness far form required dry consider thoroughly touches needed complete laying one surprised find masterly work soon look compared hurried ill considered sketch 
process know least sketching time really gained precipitation 
gained caution gained sorts ways truth form force light always added intelligent shapely laying shadow colors 
may often make simple flat tint rightly gradated edged express complicated piece subject without single retouch 
two swiss cottages instance balconies glittering windows general character shingly eaves expressed fig 
one tint gray dispersed spots lines ought able lay without thrice dipping brush without single touch tint dry

without colored illustrations tell must leave follow subject help may receive water color drawings accessible little treatises art published lately water color painters

may get valuable hints mixture colors find useful artifice process explained nearly books written help idle amateurs meretricious skill full precepts principles may part interpreted precise negatives acted upon advantage 
praise boldness safe attendant spirit beginner caution advise velocity first condition success deliberation plead generalization foundations power must laid knowledge speciality 

last place things tell respecting dangerous nobleness consummate art composition 
though quite unnecessary yet awhile attempt may inexpedient attempt ought know means look enjoy art others 
composition means literally simply putting several things together make one thing nature goodness share producing 
thus musician composes air putting notes together certain relations poet composes poem putting thoughts words pleasant order painter picture putting thoughts forms colors pleasant order 
cases observe intended unity must result composition 
pavior said compose heap stones empties cart sower handful seed scatters hand 
essence composition everything determined place perform intended part act part advantageously everything connected 

composition understood pure sense type arts mankind providential government world 
exhibition order given notes colors forms advantage perfect fellowship discipline contentment 
well composed air note however short low spared least necessary greatest note however prolonged tedious others prepare benefited duration note however high tyrannous others prepare benefited exaltation note however low overpowered others prepare sympathize humility result every note value position assigned never possessed separation others would instantly deprived 

similarly good poem word thought enhances value precede follow every syllable loveliness depends much abstract sound position 
look word dictionary hardly recognize 
much great picture every line color arranged advantage rest 
none inessential however slight none independent however forcible 
enough truly represent natural objects must fit certain places gather certain harmonious groups instance red chimney cottage merely set place chimney may affect certain way pleasurable eye pieces green blue parts picture ought see work masterly merely positions quantities patches green red blue even distance renders perfectly impossible determine colors represent see whether red chimney old woman cloak whether blue smoke sky water 

seems appointed order remind us great laws divine government human polity composition arts strongly affect every order mind however unlearned thoughtless 
hence popular delight rhythm meter simple musical melodies 
also appointed power composition fine arts exclusive attribute great intellect 
men less copy see less remember powers reflection investigation also common us decision inferiority rests questions degree 
better memory b c reflects profoundly gift composition given one man thousand highest range occur three four times century 

follows general truths impossible give rules enable compose 
might much easily receive rules enable witty 
possible witty rule wit would cease either admirable amusing possible compose melody rule mozart cimarosa need born possible compose pictures rule titian veronese would ordinary men 
essence composition lies precisely fact unteachable operation individual mind range power exalted others 
though one invent rule simple laws arrangement well know though enable produce good picture often assist set forth goodness may work telling way could done otherwise tracing work good composers may better understand grasp imagination power possesses materials 
shall briefly state chief laws 

law principality 

great object composition always secure unity make many things one whole first mode effected determining one feature shall important rest others shall group subordinate positions 
illustration fig 

simplest law ordinary ornamentation 
thus group two leaves fig 
unsatisfactory leading leaf b prettier head master leaf c satisfactory still subordination members head leaf made manifest gradual loss size fall back 
hence part pleasure greek honeysuckle ornament others 

thus also good pictures always one light larger brighter lights one figure prominent figures one mass color dominant masses general find much benefit sketch manage shall one light cottage wall one blue cloud sky may attract eye leading light leading gloom others 
observance rule often cunningly concealed great composers force hardly first traceable generally find vulgar pictures law strikingly manifest 

may simply illustrated musical melody instance phrases illustration one note upper g rules whole passage full energy concentrated 
passages corresponding completely subordinated compositions painting apt wearisome often repeated 
phrase illustration difficult say principal note 
last bar slightly dominant equal current power running whole passages rarely weary 
principle holds vast scales arrangement grandest compositions paul veronese marriage cana raphaels disputa easy fix principal figure commonly figure really chief catch eye first gradually felt conspicuous gaze 
thus titian grand composition cornaro family figure meant principal youth fifteen sixteen whose portrait evidently painter object make interesting possible 
grand madonna st george drifting banner many figures occupy center picture first catch eye little little led away gleam pearly light lower corner find head shines upon turn eyes 

every good picture nearly laws design less exemplified whole easier way explaining analyze one composition thoroughly give instances various works 
shall therefore take one turner simplest allow us speak easily decompose illustrate law proceed 
illustration fig 

fig 
rude sketch arrangement whole subject old bridge moselle coblentz town coblentz right ehrenbreitstein left 
leading master feature course tower bridge 
kept principal important group side boats right ehrenbreitstein beyond 
boats large mass forcible color broken small divisions tower simple therefore still leads 
ehrenbreitstein noble mass reduced rial perspective color contend tower therefore holds eye becomes key picture 
shall see presently objects seem first contend mastery made occultly increase pre minence 

law repetition 

another important means expressing unity mark kind sympathy among different objects perhaps pleasantest surprising kind sympathy one group imitates repeats another way balance symmetry subordinately like far away broken echo 
prout insisted much law writings composition think even authoritatively present minds great composers law principality 
quite curious see pains turner sometimes takes echo important passage color pembroke castle instance two fishing boats one red another white sail 
line beach two fish precisely relative positions one red one white 
observable uses artifice chiefly pictures wishes obtain expression repose notice plate scarborough series harbors england already occasion dwell point extract note one two sentences explain principle 
composition chosen illustration reduplication employed singular extent 
tower leading feature first repeated low echo left put finger lower tower see picture spoiled 
spires coblentz arranged couples arranged reality matter composing great picture must play towers till come right fearlessly chessmen instead cathedrals 
dual arrangement towers would easily seen little one pretends make triad last group right faint hardly discernible takes attention artifice helped mast head boat however instantly duplicate put stern 
large boat near echo beyond 
echo divided two two smaller boats two figures two figures also sitting together great rudder lies half water half aground 
finally great mass ehrenbreitstein appears first answering form almost facsimile bank girl sitting bank absolutely essential completion picture object whole series 
done deepen effect repose 

symmetry balance parts masses nearly equal opposition one conditions treatment law repetition 
opposition symmetrical object like things reflecting balance contrary natures like day night like natures like forms one side leaf set like reflection water 
symmetry nature however never formal accurate 
takes greatest care secure difference corresponding things parts things approximation accurate symmetry permitted animals motions secure perpetual difference balancing parts 
stand mirror hold arms precisely position side head upright body straight divide hair exactly middle get nearly exactly shape ear see effect accurate symmetry see less grace power human form result interference motion life symmetry reconciliation balance changefulness 
position seen mirror highest type symmetry understood modern architects 

many sacred compositions living symmetry balance harmonious opposites one profoundest sources power almost works early painters angelico perugino giotto etc furnish notable instances 
madonna perugino national gallery angel michael one side raphael beautiful example 
landscape principle balance less carried proportion wish painter express disciplined calmness 
bad compositions bad architecture formal tree one side answering tree good compositions graceful statues always easy sometimes hardly traceable 
coblentz however much difficulty seeing boats one side tower figures set nearly equal balance tower central mass uniting 

law continuity 

another important pleasurable way expressing unity giving orderly succession number objects less similar 
succession interesting connected gradual change aspect character objects 
thus succession pillars cathedral aisle interesting retire perspective becoming obscure distance succession mountain promontories one behind another flanks valley succession clouds fading farther farther towards horizon promontory cloud different shape yet evidently following calm appointed order 
change shape size objects continuity repetition monotony 
change shape suggests idea individually free able escape like law rules yet submitting 
illustration fig 


leave chosen illustrative composition moment take another still expressive law 
one turner tender studies sketch calais sands sunset delicate expression wave cloud use try reach kind outline wood cut rough sketch fig 
enough give idea arrangement 
aim painter give intensest expression repose together enchanted lulling monotonous motion cloud wave 
clouds moving innumerable ranks sun meeting towards point horizon set tidal waves gain winding currents upon sand stealthy haste cross quietly edges folding one another meet like little piece ruffled silk leaping little two children kiss clap hands going silent hurry drawing pointed arches sand thin edges intersect parting 
would enough expressed without line old pier timbers black weeds strained bent storm waves seeming stoop following one another like dark ghosts escaping slowly cruelty pursuing sea 

need hope point reader illustration law continuance subject chosen general illustration 
simply gradual succession retiring arches bridge induced turner paint subject principle led always seize subjects including long bridges wherever could find especially observe unequal bridges highest arch one side rather center 
reason irrespective general laws composition connected nature rivers may well stop minute tell let rest study composition 

rivers small large agree one character like lean little one side bear channels deepest middle always one bank sun upon another get cool one shingly shore play may shallow foolish childlike another steep shore pause purify get strength waves fully together due occasion 
rivers way like wise men keep one side life play another work brilliant chattering transparent ease yet take deep counsel side set main purpose 
rivers divided also like wicked good men good rivers serviceable deep places along banks ships sail wicked rivers go scooping irregularly banks get full strangling eddies boat row without twisted rocks pools like wells one get water kelpie lives bottom wicked good rivers agree two kinds sides 
natural way village stone mason therefore throws bridge strong stream course build great door let cat little doors let kittens great arch great current give room flood time little arches little currents along shallow shore 
even without prudential respect floods great current would simple economy work stone smaller arches less material want flanks 
two arches span river supposing butments depth cheaper one great deal current shallow village mason makes arches many low water gets deeper becomes troublesome build piers bottom throws arches wider last comes deep stream build bottom throws largest arch leap another little one gains opposite shore 
course arches wider must higher stand roadway must rise arches widen 
thus general type bridge highest widest arch towards one side train minor arches running flat shore usually steep bank river side next large arch always course flat shore side small ones bend river assuredly concave towards flat cutting round sweep steep bank steep bank still assuredly cutting shore steep end bridge 
kind bridge sympathizing spirit river marking nature thing deal conquer ideal bridge endeavors thing grand engineer manner level roadway equal arches barbarous monotonous forms ugly mind perceives cost uselessly thrown away sake formality 
illustration fig 


well return continuity 
see turnerian bridge fig 
absolutely perfect type still farther interesting main arch crowned watch tower 
want note especially perhaps case real bridge entirely turner find though arches diminish gradually one regularly diminished different shapes sizes see clearly fig 
larger diagram fig 
leaf ease 
indeed also part ideal bridge lateral currents near shore course irregular size simple builder would naturally vary arches accordingly also bottom rocky build piers rocks came 
part bridge ideal necessity noble composition irregularity introduced turner 
raises object thus treated lower vulgar unity rigid law greater unity clouds waves trees human souls different obedient harmonious service 

law curvature 

however another point noticed bridge turner slope away unequally sides slopes gradual though subtle curve 
substitute straight line curve drawing one rule base tower side ends bridge fig 
effacing curve instantly see design suffered grievously 
may ascertain experiment beautiful objects whatsoever thus terminated delicately curved lines except straight line indispensable use stability complete system straight lines throughout form necessary stability crystals beauty exists color transparency form 
cut shape crystal like white wax wood put beside white lily feel force curvature purity irrespective added color interfering elements beauty 
illustration fig 


well curves beautiful straight lines necessary good composition continuities object mass color possible curves rather straight lines angular ones 
perhaps one simplest prettiest examples graceful continuity kind line traced moment corks net drawn nearly every person less attracted beauty dotted line 
almost always possible secure continuity arrangement boundaries objects like bridge arches corks net actually connected still noble interesting kind continuity among features appear first entirely separate 
thus towers ehrenbreitstein left fig 
appear first independent give profile larger scale fig 
reader may easily perceive subtle cadence harmony among 
reason bounded one grand curve traced dotted line seven towers four precisely touch curve others falling hack keep eye discovering easily 
illustration fig 


always possible obtain continuities kind drawing large forests mountain forms essential truth 
towers ehrenbreitstein might might reality fall curve assuredly basalt rock stand mountain forms cloven absolute precipice covered straight slopes shales less governed great curves one aims nature work produce 
reader must already know able sketch among mountains let merely draw carefully outlines low hills accessible tolerably steep woods grow 
steeper shore thames maidenhead downs brighton dover even nearer croydon addington hills easily accessible londoner soon find constant graceful curvature 
graceful curvature distinguished ungraceful two characters first moderation say close approach straightness part course secondly variation say never remaining equal degree different parts course 

variation twofold good curves

thus fig

also waves clouds nobly formed masses 
thus another essential difference good bad drawing good bad sculpture depends quantity refinement minor curvatures carried good work great lines 
strictly speaking however variation large curves composition large curves small ones increase quantity beautiful element change nature 

law radiation 

hitherto concerned binding various objects beautiful lines processions 
next point consider may unite lines processions make groups

bring together one view principles ascertained trees shall find may summed four great laws perfect vegetable form appointed express four laws noble balance authority 

support one living root 

radiation tendency force one given point either root stated connection 

liberty bough seek livelihood happiness according needs irregularities action play work either stretching get required nourishment light rain finding sufficient breathing place among branches knotting gathering get strength load fruitful blossoms may lay upon stress storm tossed luxuriance leaves playing hither thither fitful sunshine may tempt young shoots undecided states mind future life 

imperative requirement bough stop within certain limits expressive kindly fellowship fraternity boughs neighborhood work according power magnitude state health bring general perfectness great curve circumferent stateliness whole tree

typically expresses healthy human actions spring radiantly like rays single heart motive beautiful systems action taking place motive lies root whole life action clearly seen proceed also many beautiful secondary systems action taking place motives deep central beautiful subordinate connection central life motive 
laws think find equally significative draw trees various states health hardship every day struck beauty types present truths essential mankind know see vegetation earth necessary life first purifying air us food necessary joy places earth trees leaves say meant teach us contemplate read hear lovely language written spoken us frightful black letters dull sentences fair green shadowy shapes waving words blossomed brightness odoriferous wit sweet whispers unintrusive wisdom playful morality 

well sorry leave wood whatever reader may leave must shall compose pictures day 
law radiation enforcing unison action arising proceeding given point perhaps principles composition influential producing beauty groups form 
laws make forcible interesting generally chief rendering beautiful 
arrangement masses pictures constantly obeyed great composers like law principality careful concealment imperativeness point lines main curvature directed often far away picture 
sometimes however system curves employed definitely exalt concurrence value leading object law becomes traceable enough 

instance us principal object seen tower bridge turner determined system curvature origin top tower 
diagram fig 
p compared fig 
p show done 
one curve joins two towers continued back figure sitting bank piece bent timber 
limiting curve great importance turner drawn considerable part edge timber carefully led eye sitting girl white spots indications ledge bank passage tops towers missed 

next curve begun drawn carefully half inch course rudder taken basket heads figures leads accurately tower angle 
gunwales boats begin next two curves meet point centralized long reflection continues vertical lines 

subordinated first system curves another begun small crossing bar wood inserted angle behind rudder continued bottom bank figure sits interrupted forcibly beyond taken water line leading bridge foot passing delicate shadows arches easily shown rude diagram towards extremity bridge 
important curve indicating force sweep river indeed old times large arches antiquity bridge told us long tongue land either carted rubbish washed minor stream interrupted curve used landing place boats embarkation merchandise bales bundles laid heap immediately beneath great tower 
common composer would put bales one side turner knows better uses foundation tower adding importance precisely sculptured base adorns pillar farther increases aspect height throwing reflection far nearer water 
great composers feeling sustaining vertical masses constantly find prout using artifice dexterously see instance figure wheelbarrow great tower sketch st nicholas prague white group figures tower sketch augsburg veronese titian tintoret continually put principal figures bases pillars 
turner found secret early prominent instance composition principle drawing turin superga hakewell italy 
chose fig 
already given illustrate foliage drawing chiefly another instance precisely arrangement serve convince intentional 
vertical formed larger tree continued figure farmer one smaller trees stick 
lines interior mass bushes radiate law radiation point behind farmer head outline curves carried repeated law continuity curves dog boy way note remarkable instance use darkest lines towards light less guiding eye right order bring finally keep windsor central object picture bridge tower coblentz 
wall boy climbs answers purpose contrasting direction character greater curves thus corresponding nearly possible minor tongue land coblentz 
however introduces us another law must consider separately 

law contrast 

course character everything best manifested contrast 
rest enjoyed labor sound heard clearly must rise silence light exhibited darkness darkness light things 
art every color opponent color brought near relieve completely also every form line may made striking eye opponent form line near curved line set straight one massy form slight one good work nearly double value given color form would uncombined given contrast 
case however manifest use artifice vulgarizes picture 
great painters commonly visibly admit violent contrast 
introduce stealth intermediate links tender change allowing indeed opposition tell upon mind surprise shock 

thus rock ehrenbreitstein fig 
main current lines downwards convex swell suddenly stopped lowest tower counter series beds directed nearly straight across 
adverse force sets relieves great curvature reconciled series radiating lines first sympathize oblique bar gradually get steeper till meet join fall great curve 
passage however intentionally monotonous ever introduced good artist without slight counter current kind much indeed great composers feel necessity even things purposely ill unsatisfactorily order give greater value well places 
skillful poet versification called bad inferior lines inferior could better feels equally weighty would real sense weight anywhere equally melodious melody would fatiguing purposely introduces laboring discordant verse full ring may felt main sentence finished sweetness chosen rhythm 
continually painting inferior artists destroy work giving much think good great painter gives enough enjoyed passes opposite kind enjoyment inferior state enjoyment gives passage rich involved exquisitely wrought color passes away slight pale simple color paints minute two intense decision suddenly becomes spectator thinks slovenly slovenly could taken decision much good paints great space picture forms rounded melting tenderness suddenly think freak gives bit jagged sharp leafless blackthorn 
perhaps exquisite piece subtle contrast world painting arrow point laid sharp white side among flowing hair correggio antiope 
quite singular little contrast sometimes serve make entire group forms interesting would otherwise valueless 
good deal picturesque material instance top old tower fig 
tiles stones sloping roof disagreeably mingled would unsatisfactory happened iron ring inner wall vigorous black circular line precisely opposes square angular characters battlements roof 
draw tower without ring see difference make 
illustration fig 


one important applications law contrast association law continuity causing unexpected gentle break continuous series 
artifice perpetual music perpetual also good illumination way little surprises change prepared current borders chains ornamental design one subtle characteristics work good periods 
take instance bar ornament two written columns early fourteenth century ms first glance suppose quite monotonous way composed winding tendril alternately blue leaf scarlet bud 
presently however see order observe law principality one large scarlet leaf instead bud nearly half way forms center whole rod begin examine order leaves find varied carefully 
let stand scarlet bud b blue leaf c two blue leaves one stalk stalk without leaf r large red leaf 
counting ground order begins follows b b b b b b b b think shall two b way suddenly becomes b b r b b b think going b continued becomes b b b b b c b b think surely going b continued behold runs away end quick b b b b b b often however designer satisfied one surprise never saw good illuminated border without one least series kind ever introduced great composer painting without snap somewhere 
pretty one turner drawing rome large balustrade foreground hakewell italy series single baluster struck line showing street gap simply makes whole composition right otherwise would stiff absurd 

look back fig 
see arrangement battlements simple instance use variation 
whole top tower though actually three sides square strikes eye continuous series five masses 
first two left somewhat square blank next two higher richer tiles seen slopes 
groups couples enough monotony series make change pleasant last battlement therefore little higher first two little lower second two different shape either 
hide finger see ugly formal four battlements look 

figure several simple illustrations laws tracing 
thus whole shape walls mass square well still sake contrast oppose element curvature ring lines roof sharpness hence pleasure eye takes projecting point roof 
also walls thick sturdy well contrast strength weakness therefore enjoy evident decrepitude roof sinks 
whole mass nearly white want contrasting shadow somewhere get piece decrepitude 
shade tiles wall forms another pointed mass necessary first law repetition 
hide inferior angle finger see ugly looks 
sense law symmetry though might hardly suppose share feeling look battlements certain pleasure opposed slopes top one side left right 
still less would think law radiation anything matter take extreme point black shadow left center follow first low curve eaves wall lead continue point tower cornice follow second curve top tiles wall strike top right hand battlement draw curve highest point angled battlement left points roof dark echo see whole top tower radiates lowest dark point 
curvatures crossing main ones keep conspicuous 
follow curve upper roof take top highest battlement stones indicated right hand side tower extended bottom order get less direct expression sympathy irregular stones may capable general flow curves left right 

may readily believe first laws indeed involved trifling piece composition 
study longer discover laws many obeyed powerful composers every touch literally never dash pencil carrying appointed purposes kind twenty various ways much difference way intention authority one great composers ruling colors common painter confused general directing march army old lady carried feet mob 

law interchange 

closely connected law contrast law enforces unity opposite things giving portion character 
instance divide shield two masses color way suppose blue white put bar figure animal partly one division partly find pleasant eye make part animal blue comes upon white half white comes upon blue half 
done heraldry partly sake perfect intelligibility yet sake delight interchange color since ornamentation whatever practice continual ages good design 

sometimes alternation merely reversal contrasts red time one side blue red shall pass blue side blue red kind alternation takes place simply four quartered shields subtle pieces treatment little bit color carried dovetailed together 
one curious facts impress upon drawn time carefully nature light shade appearance intentional artifice contrasts alternate kind produced artistry darken tree trunk long comes light sky throw sunlight precisely spot comes dark hill similarly treat masses shade color great follow closely every one looks drawing attention think inventing artificially unnaturally delightful interchanges shadow could possibly devised human wit 

find law interchange insisted upon length prout lessons light shade seems principles composition one conscious many others obeys instinct formally accepts forcibly declares 
typical purpose law interchange course teach us opposite natures may helped strengthened receiving far impress reflection imparted power 

law consistency 

remembered next place contrast exhibits characters things often neutralizes paralyzes power 
number white things may shown clearly white opposition black thing want full power gathered light black thing may seriously way 
thus contrast displays things unity sympathy employ concentrating power several mass 
art merely affairs life wisdom man continually called upon reconcile opposite methods exhibiting using materials power 
change gives pleasantness consistency value change refreshed perseverance strengthened 

hence many compositions address spectator aggregate force color line contrasts either many noble pictures painted almost exclusively various tones red gray gold instantly striking breadth flush glow tender coldness qualities exhibited slight subtle use contrast 
similarly form compositions associate massive rugged forms others slight graceful ones interruptions lines contrary character 
general compositions possess higher sublimity mingled elements 
tell special tale summon definite state feeling grand compositions merely please eye 

unity breadth character generally attaches works greatest men separate pictures separate aims 
gray color set somber sharp forms soft loud passages low bright picture delicate sadness somber picture single ray relief stern picture one tender group lines soft calm picture one rock angle flank 
hence variety work well impressiveness 
principal bearing law however separate masses divisions picture character whole composition may broken various please must certainly tendency consistent assemblage divisions 
army may act several points act effectually somewhere formed regular masses wholly skirmishers picture may various tendencies must somewhere united coherent masses 
good composers always associating colors great groups binding forms together encompassing lines securing various dexterities expedient call breadth say large gathering kind thing one place light gathered light darkness darkness color color 
however done introducing false lights false colors absurd monstrous skill painter consists obtaining breadth rational arrangement objects forced wanton treatment 
easy matter paint one thing white another black brown easy matter assemble circumstances naturally produce white one place brown another 
generally speaking however breadth result sufficient degree fidelity study nature always broad paint colors true relations paint majestic masses 
find work look broken scattered probability ill composed untrue 

opposite quality breadth division scattering light color certain contrasting charm occasionally introduced exquisite effect good composers 
still never mere scattering order discernible scattering real source pleasure mere multitude constellation multitude 
broken lights work good painter wander like flocks upon hills unshepherded speaking life peace broken lights bad painter fall like hailstones capable mischief leaving wished also dissolution 

law harmony 

last law strictly speaking much one composition truth must guide composition properly therefore stated place 
good drawing seen abstract natural facts represent would must continually falling short whether force quantity nature 
suppose means time admit giving depth color scene obliged paint paler 
paint colors proportionately paler equal quantity tint washed away still obtain harmonious though equally forcible statement natural fact 
take away colors unequally leave tints nearly deep nature others much subdued longer true statement 
say observer fancy colors little deeper actual fact 
however adds imagination takes away something sure still wrong 
picture harmony 

happen however much frequently darken whole system colors make paler 
remember first studies color nature leave passages light bright imitated white paper 
completing picture becomes necessary put color colors must made darker fixed relation 
deepen proportionately though whole scene darker reality looking reality lower light darken tints leave others undarkened picture harmony give impression truth 

indeed possible deepen colors much relieve lights natural degree would merely sink colors tried broad mass blackness quite possible lower harmoniously yet parts picture others allow show light want visible relief 
well harmonized pictures done gradually deepening tone picture towards lighter parts without materially lowering dark parts tendency pictures course include large masses middle tints 
principal point observed deepen individual tints without dirtying obscuring 
easy lower tone picture washing gray brown easy see effect landscape colors thus universally polluted black using black convex mirror one pestilent inventions falsifying nature degrading art ever put artist hand 
thing required darken pale yellow mixing gray deepen pure yellow darken crimson mixing black making deeper richer crimson thus required effect could seen nature pieces glass color every object landscape every minor hue made colors could see real landscape deep gorgeousness varied glass 
glass work say put deep blue pale blue deep gold pale gold proportion need may paint forcibly choose work still manner titian caravaggio spagnoletto black slaves painting 

supposing scales color told prepare order show relations color gray quite accurately made numerous enough would nothing order obtain deeper tone given mass color substitute hues hue many degrees deeper scale wanted say wanted deepen whole two degrees substituting yellow yellow red 
red hues object nature far numerous degrees subtle admit mechanical process 
still may see principle whole matter clearly taking group colors scale arranging prettily washing gray represents treatment nature black mirror 
arrange group colors tints five six degrees deeper scale represent treatment nature titian 

however feel way fully right thing working nature 
best subject begin piece study kind good thick tree trunk seen blue sky white clouds 
paint clouds true tenderly gradated white give sky bold full blue bringing well paint trunk leaves grandly dark glowing dark green brown see bear 
afterwards proceed complicated studies matching colors carefully first old method deepening color tint careful things keep truth equal change colors connected dark light sides object 
much aspect sense harmony gained precision observe relation colors dark sides light sides influence modifying reflections mere accuracy added depth independent colors 

harmony tone generally called important artist regard 
kinds harmonies picture according mode production 
even harmony touch 
paint one part rapidly forcibly another part slowly delicately division picture may right separately agree together whole effectless valueless harmony 
similarly paint one part yellow light warm day another gray light cold day though may sunlight may well toned relative shadows truly cast neither look like light destroy power harmony 
broad definable instances discordance extent harmony good work much subtle definition depending draughtsman carrying everything draws balancing harmonious point finish color depth tone intensity moral feeling style touch considered never allowing lean emphatically detached parts exalt one thing expense another feel acutely one place coldly another

though explain may always render sensitive higher qualities discipline generally give character especially regard choice incidents kind composition sort easier artistical arrangements lines colors every sort nobler addressed deeper feelings 

instance datur hora quieti last vignette rogers poems plow foreground three purposes 
first purpose meet stream sunlight river make brighter opposition dark object whatever would done

incident turner adopted swoop angry sea gull dog yelps drawing back wave rises feet bird shrieks within foot face 
unexpected boldness type anger ocean element warns us sea advance surely abandoned plow told us ceased labor day 

however much selection single incidents kind feeling regulates arrangement whole subject mind great composer known
