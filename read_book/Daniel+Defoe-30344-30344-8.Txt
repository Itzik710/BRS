second edition appeared till defoe death occurred 
years various editions fortunate mistress came 
defoe indicated end chief characters clearly usually stories several later editions carried history heroine 
probably none continuations defoe though one edition attributed 
reason literary merit included present edition 
continuation defoe attested various ways 
first place tells history roxana death july date defoe would likely fix died april 
moreover statement sixty four died agree statement beginning defoe narrative ten years old 
must born consequently would sixty nine 
discrepancy however ceases important consider general confusion dates part book certainly defoe 
title page announces heroine known name lady roxana time king charles ii 
must known name child eleven twelve ten parents fled england charles ii 
died february 
moreover married till fifteen lived eight years husband mistress successively friendly jeweller prince dutch merchant 
yet career returned london time become noted toast among charles ii 
courtiers entertain house monarch duke monmouth 
stronger argument different authorship difference style continuation roxana earlier narrative 
continuation defoe best known mannerisms lacking two instances show 
critics often called attention fact fright instead frighten favorite word defoe 
frighten fright verb used continuation 
furthermore pointed previous introduction defoe fond making characters smile show either kindliness shrewd penetration 
smile continuation 
differences original story fortunate mistress continuation 
former better narrative latter moves quicker real 
yet manifest attempt continuation imitate manner substance story proper 
dialogue example roxana quakeress modelled dialogues defoe fond 
fairly successful attempt copy defoe circumstantiality amount detail continuation makes graphic much fiction given world 
finally understanding reproducing characters roxana amy anonymous author done remarkably well 
character roxana daughter less true defoe conception girl drew actuated natural affection seeking mother less interest 
character dutch merchant likewise changed better continuation 
developed vindictiveness former meetings seemed foreign nature 
said fortunate mistress defoe come nearer usual writing day call novel reason success usual making characters real 
though many still wooden lifeless types rather individuals yet prince quakeress dutch merchant occasionally wake life rather unfortunate daughter yet amy roxana 
exception moll flanders last two vitalised personages defoe invented 
pair furthermore defoe seems interested bringing contrast characters 
servant amy thrown another mistress might totally different woman 
vulgarity servant would retained circumstances even promoted maid companion roxana unreasoning devotion mistress combined weakness character led amy vicious 
roxana part full independence initiative woman without rather without acting acting interests mistress amy different creature 
like defoe principal characters roxana eminently practical cold blooded selfish 
first pang parting five children seldom thinks except encumbrances provide decently without personal inconvenience even slight sacrifice sake one much 
towards men dealings towards friendly quakeress minories shows calculating reticence unfeminine 
continuator story endowed heroine wholly characteristic selfishness made hearing amy death feel less sorrow miserable fate friend loss adviser 
yet roxana capable fine feeling proved tears joy happy change fortunes bring realistic love scene prince regard supposed paint cheeks 
shipwreck threatens amy emotion repentance due much thought degraded amy level thoughts flagrant sins 
capable feeling gratitude shows generosity quakeress 
rage remorse suspecting daughter murdered emotion several times seeing children roxana shows true woman 
short though part monumentally selfish yet saved impossible several displays noble emotion 
one surprises student defoe thick skinned mercantile writer vulgarest great men letters early eighteenth century seems known woman heart better man least succeeded making two three women characters alive men 
another surprise writing women defoe often seems ahead age 
argument roxana dutch merchant woman independence roxana talks like character problem play novel day 
perhaps defoe credit credit said elsewhere woman well bred well taught furnished accomplishments knowledge behavior creature without comparison society emblem sublime enjoyments man one portion nothing rejoice thankful 
reading words one regret defoe try create heroines virtuous moll flanders roxana 
drawing characters defoe fortunate mistress comes nearer usual producing novel 
narrative less loosely constructed others except robinson crusoe journal plague year easier give structure 
story solitary desert island story visitation pestilence nature subject made author course tolerably plain fortunate mistress proper course means well marked 
credit due defoe therefore book far entirely inorganised taken sufficient pains ending would much structure many good novels 
strongly defined plot true general character introduced heard scene impresses mind heroine likely important sequel 
story seems working logical conclusion unexpectedly comes end 
defoe apparently grew tired reason wound abruptly meager information fate roxana amy fell dreadful course calamities
