small questions presented adjustment two countries particular importance easily arranged 
days seemed gone strained sensitiveness continually giving rise senseless bickerings every trilling breeze seemed fan smouldering fires jealousy 
two great english speaking nations appeared finally realized absolute folly continual disputes countries whose destiny ideals completely accord whose interests main identical

long hours artificially heated rooms something particularly soothing fresh sweetness early spring morning 
something seemed reminded however faintly mornings land perfume flowers window boxes perhaps absence hideous roar traffic faint aromatic scent lime trees park heavy recent rain 
quietest hour twenty four hour almost dawn 
night wayfarers passed away great army toilers yet slumbered 
one sad eyed woman stumbled walked slowly piccadilly 
lifted hat involuntary gesture laugh changed sob 
turned round emptied pockets silver hand hurrying away quickly eyes might dwell upon face 
coward always murmured little wearily knew weakness lay invincible repugnance ugly things life 
passed however spirits rose 
caught breath lilac scent closed florist shop 
looked skies housetops faintly blue growing clearer every moment 
almost fancied looked eyes strange girl recalled unexpected yet delightful frankness love abstract truth fascinating 
oh much said western world much said whose part live yet never much brief night walk silent streets realize absolutely unfitted even temporary sojourner vast city
