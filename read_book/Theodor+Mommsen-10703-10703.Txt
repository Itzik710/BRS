political qualities phoenicians like rest aramaean nations compared indo germans lacked instinct political life noble idea self governing freedom 
flourishing times sidon tyre land phoenicians perpetual apple contention powers ruled euphrates nile subject sometimes assyrians sometimes egyptians 
half power hellenic cities would made independent prudent men sidon calculated closing caravan routes east ports egypt would cost heaviest tribute punctually paid taxes might happen nineveh memphis even could avoid helped ships fight battles kings

settlements factories 
moment view deal buying selling natives acquire extensive territories distant lands carry slow difficult work colonization 
avoided war even rivals allowed supplanted egypt greece italy east sicily almost without resistance great naval battles fought early times supremacy western mediterranean alalia cumae etruscans phoenicians bore brunt struggle greeks 
rivalry could avoided compromised matter best could attempt ever made phoenicians conquer caere massilia

occasion earlier times took field offensive great sicilian expedition african phoenicians ended defeat himera gelo syracuse simply dutiful subjects great king order avoid taking part campaign hellenes east entered lists hellenes west syrian kinsmen fact obliged year share defeat persians salamis 
result cowardice navigation unknown waters armed vessels requires brave hearts found among phoenicians often showed 
still less result lack tenacity idiosyncrasy national feeling contrary aramaeans defended nationality weapons intellect well blood allurements greek civilization coercive measures eastern western despots obstinacy indo germanic people ever equalled us occidentals seems sometimes sometimes less human 
result want political instinct amidst lively sense ties race amidst faithful attachment city fathers formed essential feature character phoenicians

carthage paid even times prosperity ground rent space occupied city native berbers tribe maxyes maxitani although sea desert sufficiently protected city assault eastern powers carthage appears recognized although nominally supremacy great king paid tribute occasionally order secure commercial communications tyre east 
disposition submissive cringing circumstances occurred compelled phoenicians adopt energetic policy 
stream hellenic migration pouring ceaselessly towards west already dislodged phoenicians greece proper italy preparing supplant also sicily spain even libya 
phoenicians make stand somewhere willing totally crushed 
case deal greek traders great king submission suffice secure continuance commerce industry former footing liable merely tax tribute 
massilia cyrene already founded whole east sicily already hands greeks full time phoenicians think serious resistance 
carthaginians undertook task long obstinate wars set limit advance cyrenaeans hellenism unable establish west desert tripolis 
carthaginian aid moreover phoenician settlers western point sicily defended greeks readily gladly submitted protection powerful cognate city 
important successes occurred second century rome saved phoenicians south western portion mediterranean served give city achieved hegemony nation alter time political position 
carthage longer mere mercantile city aimed dominion libya part mediterranean could avoid 
probable custom employing mercenaries contributed materially successes 
custom came vogue greece somewhere middle fourth century rome among orientals carians especially far older perhaps phoenicians began 
system foreign recruiting war converted vast pecuniary speculation quite keeping character habits phoenicians 
carthaginian dominion africa probably reflex influence successes abroad first led carthaginians change character occupation africa tenure hire sufferance one proprietorship conquest

carthaginians could without restriction extract produce rich libyan soil system akin modern planters slaves chains cultivated land find single citizens possessing many twenty thousand 

agricultural villages surrounding region agriculture appears introduced among libyans early period probably anterior phoenician settlement presumably egypt subdued force arms free libyan farmers transformed fellahs paid lords fourth part produce soil tribute subjected regular system recruiting formation home carthaginian army 
hostilities constantly occurring roving pastoral tribes nomades borders chain fortified posts secured territory enclosed nomades slowly driven back deserts mountains compelled recognize carthaginian supremacy pay tribute furnish contingents

liable however either recruiting land tax contributed definite amount men money little leptis instance paying enormous sum annually talents pounds moreover lived footing equality law carthaginians could marry equal terms 
utica alone escaped similar fate walls independence preserved less perhaps power pious feeling carthaginians towards ancient protectors fact phoenicians cherished relations remarkable feeling reverence presenting thorough contrast indifference greeks

fall etruscan power fall usually case forced alliances carthage hardly exerted power avert miscarriage great projects alcibiades syracuse stood forth indisputably first greek naval power rulers syracuse naturally begin aspire dominion sicily lower italy time tyrrhene adriatic seas carthaginians also compelled adopt energetic policy 
immediate result long obstinate conflicts equally powerful infamous antagonist dionysius syracuse annihilation weakening intervening sicilian states result parties interest accomplishing division island syracusans carthaginians 
flourishing cities island selinus himera agrigentum gela messana utterly destroyed carthaginians course unhappy conflicts dionysius displeased see hellenism destroyed suppressed leaning support foreign mercenaries enlisted italy gaul spain might rule greater security provinces lay desolate occupied military colonies

constitution carthage council magistrates aristotle died fifty years commencement first punic war describes constitution carthage changed monarchy aristocracy democracy inclining towards oligarchy designates names 
conduct affairs immediately vested hands council ancients like spartan gerusia consisted two kings nominated annually citizens twenty eight gerusiasts also appears chosen annually citizens 
council mainly transacted business state making instance preliminary arrangements war appointing levies enlistments nominating general associating number gerusiasts sub commanders regularly taken despatches addressed 
doubtful whether side small council existed larger one rate much importance 
little special influence seem belonged kings acted chiefly supreme judges frequently named shofetes praetores 
power general greater 
isocrates senior contemporary aristotle says carthaginians oligarchical government home monarchical government field thus office carthaginian general may correctly described roman writers dictatorship although gerusiasts attached must practically least restricted power laid office regular official reckoning unknown among romans awaited 
existed fixed term office general reason doubtless different annual king aristotle also expressly distinguishes 
combination however several offices one person unusual among carthaginians therefore surprising often person appears general shofete 
judges gerusia magistrates subordinate corporation hundred four round numbers hundred judges main bulwark carthaginian oligarchy 
place original constitution carthage like spartan ephorate originated aristocratic opposition monarchical elements constitution 
public offices purchasable number members forming supreme board small single carthaginian family eminent others wealth military renown clan mago threatened unite hands management state peace war administration justice 
led nearly time decemvirs alteration constitution appointment new board 
know holding quaestorship gave title admission body judges candidate nevertheless elected certain self electing boards five pentarchies judges although presumably law chosen year year practically remained office longer period indeed life reason usually called senators greeks romans 
obscure details recognize clearly nature body oligarchical board constituted aristocratic cooptation isolated characteristic indication found fact carthage special baths judges common baths citizens 
primarily intended act political jurymen summoned generals particular beyond doubt shofetes gerusiasts also circumstances required reckoning resigning office inflicted even capital punishment pleasure often reckless cruelty 
course every instance administrative functionaries subjected control another body real center power passed controlled controlling authority easy understand one hand latter came interfere matters administration gerusia instance submitted important despatches first judges people hand fear control home regularly meted award according success hampered carthaginian statesman general council action 
citizens body citizens carthage though expressly restricted sparta attitude passive bystanders business state appears slight amount practical influence elections gerusia system open corruption rule nomination general people consulted nomination really made proposal part gerusia questions went people gerusia thought fit could otherwise agree 
assemblies people judicial functions unknown carthage 
powerlessness citizens probably main resulted political organization carthaginian mess associations mentioned connection compared spartan pheiditia probably guilds oligarchical management 
mention made even distinction burgesses city manual labourers leads us infer latter held inferior position perhaps beyond pale law 
character government comprehensive view several elements carthaginian constitution appears government capitalists might naturally arise burgess community middle class moderate means consisted one hand urban rabble without property living hand mouth hand great merchants planters genteel overseers 
system repairing fortunes decayed grandees expense subjects despatching tax assessors taskwork overseers dependent communities infallible token rotten urban oligarchy wanting carthage aristotle describes main cause tried durability carthaginian constitution 
time revolution worth mentioning taken place carthage either 
multitude remained without leaders consequence material advantages governing oligarchy able offer ambitious necessitous men rank satisfied crumbs form electoral corruption otherwise fell table rich 
democratic opposition indeed could fail government emerge time first punic war still quite powerless 
later period partly influence defeats sustained political influence appears increase far rapidly influence similar party period rome popular assemblies began give ultimate decision political questions broke omnipotence carthaginian oligarchy 
termination hannibalic war even enacted proposal hannibal member council hundred could hold office two consecutive years thereby complete democracy introduced certainly existing circumstances means saving carthage still time 
opposition swayed strong patriotic reforming enthusiasm fact withal overlooked rested corrupt rotten basis 
body citizens carthage compared well informed greeks people alexandria disorderly extent well deserved powerless might well asked good could arise revolutions carthage boys helped make 
capital power carthage financial point view carthage held every respect first place among states antiquity 
time peloponnesian war phoenician city according testimony first greek historians financially superior greek states revenues compared great king polybius calls wealthiest city world 
intelligent character carthaginian husbandry case subsequently rome generals statesmen disdain scientifically practice teach attested agronomic treatise carthaginian mago universally regarded later greek roman farmers fundamental code rational husbandry translated greek edited also latin command roman senate officially recommended italian landholders 
characteristic feature close connection phoenician management land capital quoted leading maxim phoenician husbandry one never acquire land could thoroughly manage 
rich resources country horses oxen sheep goats libya reason nomad economy perhaps excelled time polybius testifies lands earth great advantage carthaginians 
instructors romans art profitably working soil likewise art turning good account subjects virtue carthage reaped indirectly rents best part europe rich portions byzacitis lesser syrtis surpassingly productive region northern africa 
commerce always regarded carthage honorable pursuit shipping manufactures commerce rendered flourishing brought even natural course things golden harvests annually settlers already indicated skilfully extensive evergrowing system monopoly foreign also inland commerce western mediterranean whole carrying trade west east concentrated single harbor 
science art carthage afterwards rome seem mainly dependent hellenic influences appear neglected 
respectable phoenician literature conquest city found rich treasures art created true carthage carried sicilian temples considerable libraries 
even intellect service capital prominent features literature chiefly agronomic geographical treatises work mago already mentioned account admiral hanno voyage along west coast africa originally deposited publicly one carthaginian temples still extant translation 
even general diffusion certain attainments particularly knowledge foreign languages carthage epoch probably stood almost level rome empire forms evidence thoroughly practical turn given hellenic culture carthage 
absolutely impossible form conception mass capital accumulated london antiquity notion least may gained sources public revenue fact spite costly system carthage organized wars spite careless faithless administration state property contributions subjects customs revenue completely covered expenditure direct taxes levied citizens even second punic war power state already broken current expenses payment rome yearly instalment pounds could met without levying tax merely somewhat stricter management finances fourteen years peace state proffered immediate payment thirty six remaining instalments 
merely sum total revenues evinced superiority financial administration carthage 
economical principles later advanced epoch found us carthage alone considerable states antiquity 
mention made foreign state loans monetary system find along gold silver mention token money intrinsic value species currency used elsewhere antiquity 
fact government resolved mere mercantile speculation never would state solved problem brilliantly carthage 
comparison carthage rome economy let us compare respective resources carthage rome 
agricultural mercantile cities nothing art science substantially altogether subordinate altogether practical position except respect carthage made greater progress rome 
carthage moneyed interest preponderated landed rome time landed still preponderated moneyed agriculturists carthage universally large landlords slave holders rome period great mass burgesses still tilled fields person 
majority population rome held property therefore conservative majority carthage held property therefore accessible gold rich well cry democrats reform 
carthage already prevailed opulence marks powerful commercial cities manners police rome still maintained least externally severity frugality olden times 
ambassadors carthage returned rome told colleagues relations intimacy among roman senators surpassed conception single set silver plate sufficed whole senate reappeared every house envoys invited 
sneer significant token difference economic conditions either side 
constitution constitution aristocratic judges governed carthage senate rome system police control 
strict state dependence governing board carthage held individual magistrate injunction citizens absolutely refrain learning greek language converse greek medium public interpreter originated spirit system government rome comparison cruel harshness absolute precision bordering silliness carthaginian state tutelage roman system fining censure appears mild reasonable 
roman senate opened doors eminent capacity best sense represented nation able also trust need fear magistrates 
carthaginian senate hand based jealous control administration government represented exclusively leading families essence mistrust therefore could neither confident people would follow whither led free dread usurpations part magistrates 
hence steady course roman policy never receded step times misfortune never threw away favors fortune negligence indifference whereas carthaginians desisted struggle last effort might perhaps saved weary forgetful great national duties allowed half completed building fall pieces begin years anew 
hence capable magistrate rome ordinarily good understanding government carthage frequently decided feud masters home forced resist unconstitutional means make common cause opposing party reform 
treatment subject carthage rome ruled communities lineage kindred numerous others alien race 
rome received citizenship one district another rendered even legally accessible latin communities carthage first maintained exclusiveness permit dependent districts even cherish hope day placed upon equal footing 
rome granted communities kindred lineage share fruits victory especially acquired domains sought conferring material advantages rich noble gain least party interest subject states 
carthage retained produce victories even deprived privileged cities freedom trade 
rome rule wholly take away independence even subject communities imposed fixed tribute none carthage despatched overseers everywhere loaded even old phoenician cities heavy tribute subject tribes practically treated state slaves 
way compass carthagino african state single community exception utica would politically materially benefited fall carthage romano italic one much lose gain rebelling government careful avoid injuring material interests never least extreme measures challenged political opposition conflict 
carthaginian statesmen believed attached interests carthage phoenician subjects greater dread libyan revolt landholders means token money transferred mercantile calculation sphere apply 
experience proved roman symmachy notwithstanding seemingly looser bond connection kept together pyrrhus like wall rock whereas carthaginian fell pieces like gossamer web soon hostile army set foot african soil 
landing agathocles regulus likewise mercenary war spirit prevailed africa illustrated fact libyan women voluntarily contributed ornaments mercenaries war carthage 
sicily alone carthaginians appear exercised milder rule attained account better results 
granted subjects quarter comparative freedom foreign trade allowed conduct internal commerce probably outset exclusively metallic currency far greater freedom movement generally allowed permitted sardinians libyans 
syracuse fallen carthaginian hands policy would doubtless soon changed 
result take place owing well calculated mildness carthaginian government unhappy distractions sicilian greeks actually existed sicily party really friendly phoenicians example even island passed romans philinus agrigentum wrote history great war thoroughly phoenician spirit 
nevertheless whole sicilians must subjects hellenes least averse phoenician masters samnites tarentines romans 
finance financial point view state revenues carthage doubtless far surpassed rome advantage partly neutralized facts sources carthaginian revenue tribute customs dried far sooner needed rome carthaginian mode conducting war far costly roman 
military system military resources romans carthaginians different yet many respects unequally balanced 
citizens carthage still conquest city amounted including women children probably least numerous close fifth century century able case need set foot burgess army hoplites 
beginning fifth century rome similar circumstances sent field burgess army equally strong great extensions burgess domain course century number full burgesses capable bearing arms must least doubled 
far number men capable bearing arms rome excelled effective condition burgess soldier 
anxious carthaginian government induce citizens take part military service could neither furnish artisan manufacturer bodily vigor husbandman overcome native aversion phoenicians warfare 
fifth century still fought sicilian armies sacred band carthaginians guard general sixth single carthaginian officers excepted met carthaginian armies e g spain 
roman farmers took places muster roll also field battle 
cognate races communities latins rendered romans less service burgess troops liby phoenicians little adapted war carthaginians may easily supposed still less desirous disappeared armies towns bound furnish contingents presumably redeemed obligation payment money 
spanish army mentioned composed men single troop cavalry men consisted partly liby phoenicians 
flower carthaginian armies formed libyan subjects whose recruits capable trained able officers good infantry whose light cavalry unsurpassed kind 
added forces less dependent tribes libya spain famous slingers baleares seem held intermediate position allied contingents mercenary troops finally case need hired soldiery enlisted abroad 
far numbers concerned army might without difficulty raised almost desired strength ability officers acquaintance arms courage might capable coping rome 
however dangerously long interval elapse event mercenaries required ere could got ready roman militia able moment take field main matter nothing keep together armies carthage military honor personal advantage romans united ties bound common fatherland 
carthaginian officer ordinary type estimated mercenaries even libyan farmers much men modern warfare estimate cannon balls hence disgraceful proceedings betrayal libyan troops general himilco followed dangerous insurrection libyans hence proverbial cry punic faith carthaginians small injury 
carthage experienced full measure evils armies fellahs mercenaries could bring upon state found paid serfs dangerous foes 
carthaginian government could fail perceive defects military system certainly sought remedy every available means 
insisted maintaining full chests full magazines might time able equip mercenaries 
bestowed great care elements among ancients represented modern artillery construction machines find carthaginians regularly superior siceliots use elephants superseded warfare earlier war chariots casemates carthage stalls elephants 
could venture fortify dependent cities obliged submit occupation towns villages well open country hostile army landed africa thorough contrast state italy subject towns retained walls chain roman fortresses commanded whole peninsula 
fortification capital expended resources money art several occasions nothing strength walls saved state whereas rome held political military position secure never underwent formal siege 
lastly main bulwark state war marine lavished utmost care 
building well management vessels carthaginians excelled greeks carthage ships first built three banks oars carthaginian war vessels period mostly quinqueremes ordinarily better sailors greek rowers public slaves never stirred galleys excellently trained captains expert fearless 
respect carthage decidedly superior romans ships greek allies still fewer unable even show open sea fleet time without rival ruled western mediterranean 
conclusion sum results comparison resources two great powers judgment expressed sagacious impartial greek perhaps borne carthage rome struggle began whole equally matched 
omit add carthage put forth efforts intellect wealth capable provide artificial means attack defense unable satisfactory way make fundamental wants land army symmachy resting self supporting basis 
rome could seriously attacked italy carthage libya one could fail see little could one fail perceive carthage could long run escape attack 
fleets yet times infancy navigation permanent heirloom nations could fitted wherever trees iron water 
clear several times tested africa even powerful maritime states able prevent enemies weaker sea landing 
agathocles shown way thither roman general could follow course italy entrance invading army simply began war event libya put end converting siege unless special accidents intervene even obstinate heroic courage must finally succumb

remarks roman conduct war let us pause moment conflict extended dominion rome beyond circling sea encloses peninsula 
one longest severe romans ever waged many soldiers fought decisive battle unborn contest began 
nevertheless despite incomparably noble incidents presented scarcely name war romans managed wretchedly vacillation military political point view 
could hardly otherwise 
contest occurred amidst transition political system transition italian policy longer sufficed policy befitting great state yet found 
roman senate roman military system excellently organized purely italian policy 
wars policy provoked purely continental wars always rested capital situated middle peninsula ultimate basis operations proximately chain roman fortresses 
problems solved mainly tactical strategical marches operations occupied subordinate battles held first place fortress warfare infancy sea naval war hardly crossed men thoughts even incidentally 
easily understand especially bear mind battles period naked weapon predominated really hand hand encounter proved decisive deliberative assembly might direct operations one burgomaster might command troops

last years war hamilcar able pay sicilian mercenaries formerly resources vainly requested money might sent home might told send forces africa paid

natives districts ruled dependent carthage knew feelings provoked throughout districts slaughter decreed government expedition regulus fearful pressure taxation knew also character government never kept faith never pardoned well aware awaited disperse homes pay exacted mutiny 
carthaginians long digging mine supplied men could explode 
like wildfire revolution spread garrison garrison village village libyan women contributed ornaments pay wages mercenaries number carthaginian citizens amongst distinguished officers sicilian army became victims infuriated multitude carthage already besieged two sides carthaginian army marching city totally routed consequence blundering unskilful leader 
romans thus saw hated still dreaded foe involved greater danger ever brought foe roman wars began regret conclusion peace reality precipitate least appeared forget exhausted time state powerful standing carthaginian rival 
shame indeed forbade entering communication openly carthaginian rebels fact gave exceptional permission carthaginians levy recruits war italy prohibited italian mariners dealing libyans 
may doubted whether government rome earnest acts friendly alliance spite dealings african insurgents roman mariners continued hamilcar extremity peril recalled command carthaginian army seized imprisoned number italian captains concerned dealings senate interceded carthaginian government procured release 
insurgents appeared recognize romans natural allies 
garrisons sardinia like rest carthaginian army declared favor insurgents offered possession island romans saw unable hold attacks un conquered mountaineers interior similar offers came even community utica likewise taken part revolt hard pressed arms hamilcar 
latter suggestion declined romans chiefly doubtless acceptance would carried beyond natural boundaries italy therefore farther roman government disposed go hand entertained offers sardinian mutineers took portion sardinia hands carthaginians

carthaginians whose troubles reached height period occupation sardinia silent time unwarrantable violence peril contrary expectations probably contrary hopes romans averted genius hamilcar carthage reinstated full sovereignty africa carthaginian envoys immediately appeared rome require restitution sardinia 
romans inclined restore booty replied frivolous rate irrelevant complaints sorts injuries alleged carthaginians inflicted roman traders hastened declare war principle politics power measure right appeared naked effrontery

islands lost libya ferment state weakened utmost twenty four years struggle rome dreadful civil war raged nearly five years obliged submit repeated entreaties phoenicians bound pay rome compensation talents pounds warlike preparations wantonly occasioned romans reluctantly desisted war 
thus romans acquired sardinia almost without struggle added corsica ancient possession etruscans perhaps detached roman garrisons still remained last war 
sardinia however still rugged corsica romans restricted phoenicians done occupation coasts 
natives interior continually engaged war speak correctly hunting like wild beasts baited dogs carried captured slave market undertook real conquest 
occupied islands account security italy 
confederacy possessed three large islands might call tyrrhene sea 
method administration transmarine possessions provincial praetors acquisition islands western sea italy introduced state administration rome distinction appearance originated mere considerations convenience almost accidentally nevertheless came deepest importance time following distinction continental transmarine forms administration use appellations afterwards current distinction italy provinces 
hitherto two chief magistrates community consuls legally defined sphere action contrary official field extended far roman government 
course however practice made division functions course also bound every particular department duties enactments existing regard jurisdiction instance roman citizens every case left praetor latin autonomous communities existing treaties respected 
four quaestors since distributed throughout italy formally least restrict consular authority italy rome regarded simply auxiliary magistrates dependent consuls 
mode administration appears first extended also territories taken carthage sicily sardinia governed years quaestors superintendence consuls romans must soon become practically convinced indispensable superior magistrates specially appointed transmarine regions 
obliged abandon concentration roman jurisdiction person praetor community became enlarged send remote districts deputy judges concentration administrative military power person consuls abandoned 
new transmarine regions viz 
sicily sardinia corsica annexed appointed special auxiliary consul rank title inferior consul equal praetor otherwise like consul earlier times praetorship instituted sphere action commander chief chief magistrate supreme judge

segesta halicyae first towns carthaginian sicily joined roman alliance centuripa inland town east island destined keep watch syracusan territory neighborhood halaesa northern coast first free greek towns join romans panormus hitherto capital carthaginian destined become roman sicily 
romans thus applied sicily ancient principle policy subdividing dependent communities carefully graduated classes different privileges average sardinian sicilian communities position allies manifest relation tributary subjection 
italy provinces true thorough distinction communities furnished contingents paid tribute least furnish contingents law necessarily coincident distinction italy provinces 
transmarine communities might belong italian confederacy mamertines example substantially level italian sabellians existed legal obstacle establishment even new communities latin rights sicily sardinia country beyond apennines

thus transmarine possessions merely placed footing land held subjects destined remain footing time come whereas official field recently marked law consuls thing continental territory romans become new extended italy reach alps ionian sea

nevertheless felt capital would imprudent put fidelity allies test without roman army keep field 
dictator quintus fabius combined two supplementary legions formed rome army ariminum hannibal marched past roman fortress luceria towards arpi roman standards appeared right flank aeca

news successes course lost nothing telling storm broke forth capital quintus fabius 
altogether unwarranted 
prudent part rome abide defensive expect success mainly cutting enemy means subsistence yet something strange system defense starving enemy laid waste central italy without opposition beneath eyes roman army equal numbers provisioned sufficiently winter organized method foraging greatest scale

thus roman army hazardous division two separate corps appropriately obviated divided two sections placed leaders notoriously followed quite opposite plans war 
quintus fabius course adhered ever methodical inaction marcus minucius compelled justify field battle title dictator made hasty attack inadequate forces would annihilated colleague averted greater misfortune seasonable interposition fresh corps 
last turn matters justified measure system passive resistance 
reality hannibal completely attained campaign arms could attain single material operation frustrated either impetuous deliberate opponent foraging though unattended difficulty yet main successful army passed winter without complaint camp gerunium 
cunctator saved rome compact structure confederacy less perhaps national hatred phoenician hero regarded part occidentals

besides legion praetor lucius postumius destined valley po order possible draw celts serving army hannibal homes 
resolutions judicious everything depended coming equally judicious decision respecting supreme command 
stiff carriage quintus fabius attacks demagogues provoked rendered dictatorship senate generally unpopular ever amongst people without connivance leaders foolish report circulated senate intentionally prolonging war

four new legions corresponding contingent italians brought roman army rose infantry half burgesses half allies cavalry one third burgesses two thirds allies whereas hannibal army numbered cavalry infantry 
hannibal wished nothing much battle merely general reasons explained specially wide apulian plain allowed develop whole superiority cavalry providing supplies numerous army would soon spite excellent cavalry rendered difficult proximity enemy twice strong resting chain fortresses
