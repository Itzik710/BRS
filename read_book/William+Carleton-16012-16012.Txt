moment man acquainted inhabitants two countries know english vernacular ireland spoken far purity grammatical precision heard beyond channel 
habit defending termed bulls apologizing us injustice miss edgeworth writing essay upon subject wrote essay upon never exist 
observations easily account view us always taken dramatic portion english literature 
irishman drawn every instance object ridicule consequently contempt incontrovertibly true man laugh soon despise 
every point view wrong principally political one 
time england englishmen knew little ireland consequently principal opportunities afforded appreciating character found stage 
course natural erroneous estimate us formed influence everywhere else 
sympathize laugh object time irishman found undeservedly object coarse unjust ridicule unnatural requite prejudice principles feelings englishmen quite strong entertained 
ridicule confined stage directed us presence better opportunities knowing us would comparatively harmless 
case 
passed stage recesses private life wrought feelings became prejudice irishman consequently looked upon treated made absurdity cunning compound knave fool fit punished knavery laughed folly 
far therefore portion english literature attempted describe language habits irishmen unconsciously creating unfriendly feeling two countries feeling happy say fast disappearing requires full fair acquaintance order removed ever 
present indeed mutual positions civil commercial political different half century ago even recent period 
progress science astonishing improvements steam machinery completely removed obstructions impeded intercourse two nations scarcely considered divided 
natural consequence knowledge improved always happen generous people begin see one neither knave fool churl boor 
thus mutual respect arisen mutual intercourse hitherto approached distrust beginning perceive spite political religious prejudices matter stimulated truthful experience life event create nothing good confidence countries 
causes however led causes every state society exercise quick powerful influence minds men allude literature 
irishman made stand forth butt ridicule neighbors first undertook vindication maria edgeworth

national works like healthful true produced knew country exhibiting irishmen blundering buffoons english stage men capable thinking clearly feeling deeply works say enable generous people english undoubtedly divest prejudices long entertained us natural gratifying 
achieved great object aided achieving unquestionably rendered services important nature countries well literature general 
yet whilst highly gifted individuals named succeeded making countrymen respected one circumstance nothwithstanding every exhibition genius love country still remained reproach character nation 
nearly century completely mercy british neighbors probably amused expense greater license assured sense impunity inasmuch knew utterly destitute national literature 
unfortunately fact could disputed 
last half century come far ireland use plain metaphor instead producing native intellect home consumption forced subsist upon scanty supplies could procured sister kingdom 
reproach added great strength general prejudice us 
nation may produce one man ten men eminence succeed impressing mind upon spirit intellect country create taste literature science matter highly may appreciated strangers reached exalted purposes genius

literature men women genius uniformly carried talents english market whilst labored home dark privations literary famine 
truth within last ten twelve years irish author never thought publishing country consequence literary men followed example great landlords became absentees drained country intellectual wealth precisely others exhausted rents 
thus ireland stand singular anomaly adding distinguished names literature great britain whilst remained incapable presenting anything world beyond school book pamphlet even latter well known subject considered important author man talent station society certain published london 
precisely state country two first volumes traits stories irish peasantry given public house messrs gurry co sackville street 
appeared author consequence originating irish press entertained expectation would read excite interest whatever either england scotland 
however without strong confidence notwithstanding wild uncleared state country time far native literature concerned two little pioneers would work way least moderate success

rapid sale success first series encouraged author bring second different bookseller 
spirit publishing beginning extend talent country put motion 
popularity second effort surpassed first author gratification knowing generosity public feeling opinion accorded still higher position critics day without dissentient voice 
still case first effort saw honest pride country countrymen placed highest value upon works best understood 
time literary taste metropolis began feel first symptoms life 
yet however faint 
two three periodicals attempted though considerable merit conducted able men none believe reached year growth 
dublin literary gazette national magazine dublin monthly magazine dublin university review perished infancy however unworthy success ireland fast becoming reading consequently thinking country 
every one author contributed satisfaction able say publication projected purely advancement literature country given aid pen whether received remuneration 
indeed consciousness success works humble means inciting others similar exertion country thus giving first impulse literature one part created enthusiastic interest die 
notwithstanding failure periodicals mentioned clear intellect country beginning feel strength put forth power 
national spirit rose narrow distinctions creed party began form first impulses early enthusiasm periodical established necessary name dublin university magazine work unsurpassed magazine day moreover without ever departing principles bond union literary men every class time time enriched pages contributions 
neutral spot country party feeling runs high roman catholic priest protestant parson whig tory radical divested respective prejudices meet amicable spirit

number ability importance works issued dublin press within last eight ten years could enumerated would exhibit rapid progress national mind satisfy reader ireland years able sustain native literature lofty generous beneficial country world boast

words upon moral physical condition people may unsuitable close especially sake may wish acquire knowledge general character previous perusal following volume 
task true one difficulty years ago 
much light thrown irish character great names already enumerated equally high omitted 
subject would impossible overlook names lever maxwell otway forget mellow hearth light chimney corner tone happy dialogue legendary truth characterize exquisite fairy legends crofton croker 
much difficulty task say removed writers remains enough still behind justify giving short dissertation upon habits feelings countrymen 
whose physical state deplorably wretched may supposed tone morals either high pure yet consider circumstance lengthened period placed undeniable irishman remarkably moral man 
let us suppose instance england scotland great body people couple three centuries never received adequate proper education case let us ask moral aspect society either country would day merely thing considered 
irishman educated actually punished attempting acquire knowledge first place second punished also ignorance created absence 
words penal laws rendered education criminal caused unhappy people suffer crimes proper knowledge would prevented committing 
like depriving man sight afterwards causing punished stumbling 
beyond question time wars elizabeth introduction reformation recently fixed system wholesome education country 
people possessed strong political religious prejudices left state physical destitution moral ignorance calculated produce ten times amount crime committed 
wonder condition social errors dangerous theories generated neglect poverty ignorance combined give country character turbulence outrage causes produce effects country standard personal domestic comfort low ireland doubt historian would much darker catalogue crime record 
irishman fact mute patient circumstances would driven better fed comfortable englishman open outrage contempt authority 
god forbid moment become apologist crime much less crimes countrymen beyond question principles upon country governed leave present day many evil consequences behind 
penal code sure abolished many political effects among people 
consequences yet departed country hereditary hatred laws unconsciously descended father son ceased regulate conduct opinions 
thousands ignorant ever thing penal code existed yet feeling law survives although source transmitted may forgotten 
easily account much political violence crime moments great excitement produce among us need feel surprised state things continued manifest injury people baneful effects agitation 
period therefore putting character country fairly upon trial yet arrived although willing take irishman find would shrink even present moment comparing neighbors 
political sins consequences left heirloom result state things occasion 
setting aside man found country carried privations penalties many best virtues nature countries man commits great crime always great criminal whole heart hardened debased ireland 
agrarian political outrage often perpetrated men possess best virtues humanity whose hearts individuals actually abhor crime 
moral standard doubt dreadfully erroneous correct christian one emanating better system education shall substituted people think feel impossible utterly prevent occurrence great evils 
must wait thirty forty years rising perhaps subsequent generation shall educated wild destructive prejudices fully estimate degree excellence national character may arrive

know questionable defense say principally crimes originate agrarian political vengeance 
indeed believe far circumstance looked upon defense ought considered aggravation guilt inasmuch beyond doubt least far manly thing inflict injury upon enemy face face influence immediate resentment crouch like cowardly assassin behind hedge coolly murder without one moment preparation means whatsoever defense 
description crime man one generous drop blood veins think without shame indignation 
unhappily however security human life every crime kind results dark tyranny secret confederacies lower classes organized natural appetite shedding blood 
individually irish loathe murder much people world circumstances us often happens irishman free agent far contrary frequently made instrument system must become either obedient slave victim 
even however although nothing ought said palliate cowardly unmanly crime assassination yet something certainly advanced account state feeling time time frequent occurrence came habitual among people familiarity became stripped criminality horror 
idle would dishonest deny fact lower irish comparatively recent period treated apathy gross neglect class could ought look sympathy protection 
conferring elective franchise upon forty shilling freeholders words upon paupers added absence proper education means acquiring generated fraudulent subdivision small holdings bribery perjury corruption state moral feeling among poorer classes could productive much crime 
yet notwithstanding shameful prostitution morals comfort purposes political ambition personal aggrandizement general peaceable enduring people act unjustifiable severity oppression person middleman agent hardhearted landlord drove houseless upon world fell back upon darker crimes speaking 
ask could expected state things generated indeed wondered set men completely neglected duties old landlords ireland weapons turned moral profligacy first put hands corrupted

discussed think sufficient candor impartiality portion national character appears worst weakest eyes neighbors attempted show pre existing circumstances originating unwise policy much calling existence shaping evil impulses come agreeable task consideration social domestic virtues 
irishman immeasurably outstrips competitors 
hospitality habit principle indeed quick generous temperament ninety cases hundred feeling precedes reflection others prompts virtue 
stranger friendless suffering hunger thirst time sufficient passport heart purse merely thing virtue also manner constitutes charm runs conduct 
natural politeness sincerity manner man mistake fact truth felt thousand times make feel acceptance favor kindness bestows compliment rather 
delicate ingenuity diminishes nature amount kindness proves common man either heart intellect fails lie like lucifer absolutely seduce acceptance hospitality assistance 
speak exclusively peasantry 
certainly domestic life man exquisitely affectionate humanized irishman 
national imagination active national heart warm follows naturally tender strong domestic relations 
unlike people nations grief loud lasting vehement deep whilst shadow chequered laughter mirth cheerful disposition still moments seclusion bedside prayer grave loved put forth half life vivid power recollection sometimes almost beyond belief 
irish however naturally refined people mean refinement appreciates cherishes whatever nature manifested influence softer arts music poetry 
effect music upon irish heart ought know well man need tell barbarous cruel people ever possessed national music beautiful pathetic 
music nation manifestation general feeling creates although doubt one formed perpetuates reproduces 
wonder domestic feelings irish singularly affectionate strong consider spite every obstruction kept softening influence music poetry 
music poetry essentially whether streaming summer still glens poured forth winter hearth still soft melancholy spirit stirring thousand tender associations must necessarily touch improve heart 
reason heart becomes remarkably eloquent poetical moved sorrow 
many time seen keener commence wail corpse near relative degrees risen simple wail cry high mournful recitative extemporized excitement moment sentiments highly figurative impressive 
aided much genius language possesses finest copious vocabulary world expression either sorrow love 
said irish notwithstanding deep susceptibility sorrow light hearted people strictly true 
however one fact natural consequence man instance ever possessed higher order humor whose temperament naturally melancholy country world clearly establishes point ireland 
melancholy mirth simply proximate state frequently flash together separate quickly alternation blending case may whilst felt spectators yet stands beyond known rules philosophy solve 
one acquainted ireland knows country mirth lighter sorrow deeper smile tear seen frequently face moment 
mirth however levity sorrow gloom reason none dreary desponding reactions take place france especially frequently terminate suicide 
recreations irish varied highly intellectual cast 
latter however altogether disappeared country events fast disappearing 
old harper hardly seen senachie exists dim faded representative old chronicler palmy days prophecy man unfortunately survived failure best cherished predictions 
poor old prophet stock trade nearly exhausted little remains slaughter take place mill louth human blood miller six fingers two thumbs hand collateral prognostication bloody event 
amusement derived persons undoubtedly imaginative character gives sufficient proof national intellect duly cultivated difficult say position literary country ireland might stood day 
present national recreations though still sufficiently varied numerous neither strongly marked diversified formerly 
fun love sure essential principle irish character nothing happen matter solemn sorrowful may allowed proceed without 
ireland house death sure merriest one neighborhood mirth kindly considerately introduced motives sympathy words alleviation mourners sorrow 
thing may said association religion 
whoever witnessed station ireland made blessed lake holy well understand 
places quite usual see young men women devoutly circumambulating well lake bare knees marks penitence contrition strongly impressed upon faces whilst hour two individuals may found tent dancing ecstatic vehemence music bagpipe fiddle 
things however found trust may say faithfully depicted following volume together many important features general character would dwell detailed fully parts works wish deprive force novelty occur appear heavy repetition 
conclusion endeavored success already determined voice country give panorama irish life among people comprising one view strong points general character loves sorrows superstitions piety amusements crimes virtues say solemn truth painted honestly without reference existence particular creed party
