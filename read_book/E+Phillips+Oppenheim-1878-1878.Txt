man woman stood face face light badinage passing suddenly ended man sin stripped bare mercilessly exposed woman accuser passionately eloquent pouring scorn upon mute victim 
audience knew woman play know love man sinned save terrible danger hovered near life 
curtain fell woman leaving room final taunt flung shoulder man seated table looking steadfastly fire fixed unseeing eyes 
audience drew little breath applauded orchestra struck buzz conversation began 
ernestine first noticed absorbed man side become 
hands gripping arms stall eyes fixed upon spot somewhere behind curtain sudden little drama played though indeed could pierce heavy upholstery see beyond room air seemed quivering still vehemence woman outpoured scorn 
ernestine spoke last sound voice brought back start present

music violins balcony blended soft gay voices women 
ernestine side every one good humored enjoying hospitality 
one face table reminder instability fortunes face grown hate last hours passionate concentrated hatred 
yet man race people connections known many making new friends reviving old ties every moment 
brief lull conversation clear soft voice suddenly reached trent ears 
telling story 
africa saying country surprises 
attra seems city hopeless exile white people 
last time used notice every day old man making pretence working kitchen garden attached little white mission house basle society depot 
always seemed leaning spade always gazing seawards intent fascinated way 
one told history last 
englishman good position got trouble younger days served term years prison 
came sooner disgrace family published false account death sailed disguised name africa 
lived ever since growing older sinking lower often near fortune always missing slave bad habits weak dissolute like ever keeping voluntary sacrifice ever unconquerable longing one last glimpse country people 
saw many months ago still still eyes turned seawards wistful droop head 
somehow help thinking old man also hero 
tinkling glasses sort murmuring whispered conversation ceased francis story 
every one little affected soft throbbing violins upon balcony almost relief 
little murmur sympathetic remarks amongst trent sat head table white set face red fire eyes

nothing life make worthy woman love surely nothing could ever make possible woman ernestine wendermott ever care 
wealth africa could never make anything different 
yet sat realized knew writing life failure 
beside desire things cared life 
already weary financial warfare city life palled upon 
looked around magnificent room mansion agents bought furnished
