later father zahm notre dame university indiana maurice egan president appointed minister denmark 
occasion question father zahm returned trip across andes amazon came propose left presidency go paraguay interior south america 
time wished go africa subject dropped time time afterward talked 
five years later spring accepted invitations conveyed governments argentina brazil address certain learned bodies countries 
occurred instead making conventional tourist trip purely sea round south america finished lectures would come north middle continent valley amazon decided write father zahm tell intentions 
however desired see authorities american museum natural history new york city find whether cared take couple naturalists brazil make collecting trip museum 
accordingly wrote frank chapman curator ornithology museum accepted invitation lunch museum one day early june 
lunch addition various naturalists astonishment also found father zahm soon saw told intending make south american trip 
appeared made mind would take actually come see mr chapman find latter could recommend naturalist go said would accompany 
chapman pleased found intended go paraguay across valley amazon much ground pass covered collectors 
saw henry fairfield osborn president museum wrote museum would pleased send couple naturalists approval chapman would choose 
men chapman recommended messrs george k cherrie leo e miller 
gladly accepted 
former attend chiefly ornithology latter mammalogy expedition help

one night weeks later obliged leave camping place intended spend night baby fretful cries attracted jaguar prowled nearer nearer twilight thought safest put open river seek new resting place 
cherrie spent twenty two years collecting american tropics 
like field naturalists met unusually efficient fearless man willy nilly forced times vary career taking part insurrections 
twice behind bars consequence one occasion spending three months prison certain south american state expecting day taken shot 
another state interlude ornithological pursuits followed career gun runner acting two half years

much difficulty experienced exploring forests torrential rains steaming heat rank growth vegetation becomes almost impenetrable streams difficult navigation white men suffer much terrible insect scourges deadly diseases modern science discovered due largely insect bites 
fauna flora however great interest 
american museum particularly anxious obtain collections divide headwaters paraguay amazon southern affluents amazon 
purpose ascend paraguay nearly possible head navigation thence cross sources one affluents amazon possible descend canoes built spot 
paraguay regularly navigated high boats go 
starting point trip asuncion state paraguay 
exact plan operations necessarily little indefinite reaching rio de janeiro minister foreign affairs mr lauro muller kind enough take great personal interest trip informed arranged headwaters paraguay town caceres would met brazilian army colonel chiefly indian blood colonel rondon 
colonel rondon quarter century foremost explorer brazilian hinterland 
time manaos lieutenants caceres notified coming 
important still mr lauro muller efficient public servant man wide cultivation quality reminded john hay offered help make trip much consequence originally intended 
taken keen interest exploration development interior brazil believed expedition could used means toward spreading abroad general knowledge country 
told would co operate every way cared undertake leadership serious expedition unexplored portion western matto grosso attempt descent river flowed nobody knew whither best informed men believed would prove big river utterly unknown geographers 
eagerly gladly accepted felt help trip could made much scientific value substantial addition could made geographical knowledge one least known parts south america 
accordingly arranged colonel rondon assistants scientists meet corumba attempt descent river already come across headwaters 
travel brazil uruguay argentine chile six weeks fulfil speaking engagements 
fiala cherrie miller sigg left rio continuing buenos aires boat come new york 
buenos aires went paraguay corumba awaited 
two naturalists went first collecting possible fiala sigg traveled leisurely heavy baggage 
followed witnessed incident worthy note standpoint naturalist possible importance us trip take 
south america even australia africa almost much india country poisonous snakes 
india although degree snakes responsible serious mortality among human beings 
one interesting evidences modern advance brazil establishment near sao paulo institution especially study poisonous snakes secure antidotes poison develop enemies snakes 
wished take interior us bottles anti venom serum expedition always certain danger snakes 
one trips cherrie lost native follower snake bite 
man bitten alone forest although reached camp poison already working could give intelligible account occurred died short time 
poisonous snakes several different families poisonous ones dangerous man belong two great families colubrine snakes vipers 
colubrine snakes entirely harmless common snakes meet everywhere 
cobras instance develop whole perhaps formidable snakes 
poisonous colubrine snakes new world ring snakes coral snakes genus elaps found extreme southern united states southward argentine 
coral snakes vicious small teeth penetrate even ordinary clothing 
dangerous actually trodden one bare feet seized hand 
harmless snakes like color sometimes kept pets behooves every man keeps pet handles snake sure genus belongs 
great bulk poisonous snakes america including really dangerous ones belong division widely spread family vipers known pit vipers 
south america include two distinct subfamilies genera whether called families subfamilies genera would depend suppose largely upon varying personal views individual describer subject herpetological nomenclature 
one genus includes rattlesnakes big brazilian species dangerous southern united states 
large majority species individuals dangerous snakes tropical america included genus lachecis 
active vicious aggressive snakes without rattles 
exceedingly poisonous 
grow large size indeed among largest poisonous snakes world rivals respect diamond rattlesnake florida one african mambas indian hamadryad snake eating cobra 
fer de lance dreaded martinique equally dangerous bushmaster guiana included genus 
dozen species known brazil biggest one identical guiana bushmaster common one jararaca identical practically identical fer de lance 
snakes genus like rattlesnakes old world vipers puff adders possess long poison fangs strike clothes human garment except stout leather 
moreover aggressive snakes world except possibly cobras 
addition numerous source really frightful danger scantily clad men work fields forests reason abroad night 
poison venomous serpents least uniform quality 
contrary natural forces use term vague exact present day knowledge permits developed many different families snakes poisoned fangs worked two three totally different fashions 
unlike vipers colubrine poisonous snakes small fangs poison though whole even deadly entirely different effects owes deadliness entirely different qualities 
even within family wide differences 
jararaca extraordinary quantity yellow venom spurted long poison fangs 
poison secreted large glands among vipers give head peculiar ace spades shape 
rattlesnake yields much smaller quantity white venom quantity quantity white venom deadly 
great quantity venom injected long fangs jararaca bushmaster fellows renders bite generally fatal 
moreover even two allied genera pit vipers differences action poison sufficiently marked easily recognizable render effective anti venomous serum slightly different 
however near enough alike make difference practice comparatively small consequence 
practice serum used neutralize effect either seen later snake immune one kind venom also immune 
effect venom poisonous colubrine snakes totally different although full deadly effect poison rattlesnake jararaca 
serum antidote regards colubrines 
animal immune bite one may immune bite 
bite cobra colubrine poisonous snake painful immediate effects bite one big vipers 
victim suffers 
greater effect nerve centres less swelling wound whereas blood rattlesnake victim coagulates blood victim elapine snake one poisonous american colubrines becomes watery incapable coagulation 
snakes highly specialized every way including prey 
live exclusively warm blooded animals mammals birds 
live exclusively batrachians others lizards insects 
species live exclusively snakes 
include one formidable venomous snake indian hamadryad giant cobra several non poisonous snakes 
africa killed small cobra contained within snake inches shorter far could find snakes habitual diet african cobras 
poisonous snakes use venom kill victims also kill possible foe think menaces 
good tempered fight injured seriously alarmed 
others excessively irritable rare occasions even attack accord entirely unprovoked unthreatened 
reaching sao paulo southward journey rio montevideo drove instituto serumtherapico designed study effects venom poisonous brazilian snakes 
director doctor vital brazil performed extraordinary work whose experiments investigations utmost value brazil ultimately recognized utmost value humanity large 
know institution similar kind anywhere 
fine modern building best appliances experiments carried kinds serpents living dead object discovering properties several kinds venom developing various anti venom serums nullify effects different venoms 
every effort made teach people large practical demonstration open field lessons thus learned laboratory 
one notable result diminution mortality snake bites province sao paulo 
connection institute right laboratory doctor large serpentarium quantities common poisonous non poisonous snakes kept rarer ones 
devoted considerable time effort find natural enemies poisonous snakes country discovered formidable enemy many dangerous brazilian snakes non poisonous entirely harmless rather uncommon brazilian snake mussurama 
interesting things doctor showed us far interesting opportunity witnessing action mussurama toward dangerous snake 
doctor first showed us specimens various important snakes poisonous non poisonous alcohol 
showed us preparations different kinds venom different anti venom serums presenting us latter use journey 
able produce two distinct kinds anti venom serum one neutralize virulent poison rattlesnake bite neutralize poison different snakes lachecis genus 
poisons somewhat different moreover appear differences poisons different species lachecis cases poison nearly colorless others jararaca whose poison saw yellow 
vital difference poisons pit vipers poisons colubrine snakes cobra coral snake 
yet doctor able develop anti venom serum neutralize poison colubrine snakes 
practically matter little consequence brazil brazilian coral snakes dangerous mishandled one whose bare skin exposed bite 
numerous accidents fatalities continually occurring brazil almost always laid account several species lachecis single species rattlesnake 
finally doctor took us lecture room show us conducted experiments 
various snakes boxes one side room care skilful impassive assistant handled cool fearless caution doctor 
poisonous ones taken means long handled steel hook 
necessary insert snake lift ground 
unable escape unable strike strike unless coiled give support leverage 
table snakes laid fairly large smooth differing way ordinary table 
number us room including two three photographers 
doctor first put table non poisonous vicious truculent colubrine snake 
struck right left us 
doctor picked opened mouth showed fangs handed 
also opened mouth examined teeth put whereupon temper much ruffled struck violently two three times 
action temper snake quite vicious irritable poisonous snakes 
yet entirely harmless 
one innumerable mysteries nature present absolutely insoluble snakes vicious others absolutely placid good tempered 
removing vicious harmless snake doctor warned us get away table attendant put succession big lachecis kind called bushmaster big rattlesnake 
coiled menacingly formidable brute ready attack anything approached 
attendant adroitly dropped iron crook neck succession seized right behind head held toward doctor 
snake mouth case wide open great fangs erect evident 
would possible held african ring necked cobra fashion ring neck would ejected venom fangs eyes onlookers 
danger case doctor inserted shallow glass saucer mouth snake behind fangs permitted eject poison squeezed remaining poison poison bags fangs 
big lachecis came large quantity yellow venom liquid speedily crystallized number minute crystals 
rattlesnake yielded much less quantity white venom doctor assured us far active yellow lachecis venom 
snake returned box unharmed 
doctor took box presented fine handsome nearly black snake individual species called mussurama 
eyes perhaps interesting serpent world 
big snake four five feet long sometimes even longer nearly black lighter friendly placid temper 
lives exclusively snakes completely immune poison lachecis rattlesnake groups contain really dangerous snakes america 
doctor brazil told conducted many experiments interesting snake 
common prefers wet places live 
lays eggs female remains coiled eggs object apparently warm prevent great evaporation 
eat moulting cold weather 
otherwise eat small snake every five six days big one every fortnight 
widest difference among poisonous non poisonous snakes alone nervousness irascibility also ability accustom way surroundings 
many species non poisonous snakes entirely harmless man animal except small prey nevertheless vicious truculent striking right left biting freely smallest provocation case species doctor previously placed specimen table 
moreover many snakes entirely harmless vicious ones nervous uneasy greatest difficulty induced eat captivity slightest disturbance interference prevent eating 
snakes however mussurama perhaps best example good captives time fearless showing complete indifference observed handled feeding 
united states beautiful attractive snake king snake much habits mussurama 
friendly toward mankind poisonous handled freely 
feeds serpents kill rattlesnake big immune rattlesnake venom 
mr ditmars bronx zoo made many interesting experiments king snakes 
possession 
good natured generally handled impunity known bite whereas doctor brazil informed almost impossible make mussurama bite man 
king snake feed greedily snakes presence man knew one case partly swallowed another snake small boy pocket 
immune viper poison immune colubrine poison 
couple years ago informed case one king snakes put enclosure indian snake eating cobra hamadryad size 
killed cobra made effort swallow soon showed effects cobra poison 
believe afterward died unfortunately mislaid notes remember details incident 
doctor brazil informed mussurama like king snake immune colubrine poison 
mussurama possession impunity killed eaten several rattlesnakes representatives lachecis genus also killed ate venomous coral snake shortly afterward died effects poison 
one many puzzles nature american serpents kill poisonous serpents grown immune poison dangerous american poisonous serpents pit vipers become immune poison coral snakes commonly distributed throughout range 
yet judging one instance mentioned doctor brazil attack master coral snakes although conflict end results death 
would interesting find whether attack exceptional whether mussurama species learned avoid coral snake 
exceptional instance highly curious would also go far explain failure mussurama become plentiful 
benefit acquainted subject may mention poison poisonous snake dangerous species unless injected large doses ten times would normally injected bite deadly snakes poisonous non poisonous save regards species eat poisonous snakes 
indian hamadryad giant cobra exclusively snake eater 
evidently draws sharp distinction poisonous non poisonous snakes mr ditmars recorded two individuals bronx zoo habitually fed harmless snakes attack eagerly refused attack copperhead thrown cage evidently afraid pit viper 
would interesting find hamadryad afraid prey pit vipers also whether prey small relative true cobra may well even immune viper poison immune poison close ally smaller cobra 
many questions would speedily settled doctor brazil given opportunity test 
must remembered moreover researches absorbing value standpoint pure science also real utilitarian worth 
collecting breeding mussurama 
favorite prey mussurama common therefore dangerous poisonous snake brazil jararaca known martinique fer de lance 
martinique elsewhere snake object terror times genuine scourge 
surely would worth authorities martinique import specimens mussurama island 
mortality snake bite british india great 
surely would well worth able indian government copy brazil create institute doctor vital brazil curator 
first sight seems extraordinary poisonous serpents dreaded irresistible animals utterly helpless creatures prey 
explanation easy 
highly specialized creature higher specialization apt proportionately helpless peculiar specialized traits effectively nullified opponent 
eminently case dangerous poisonous snakes 
highly peculiar specialization carried highest point 
rely attack defense purely poison fangs 
means methods attack defense atrophied 
neither crush tear teeth constrict bodies 
poison fangs slender delicate save poison wound inflicted trivial character 
consequence helpless presence animal poison affect 
several mammals immune snake bite including various species hedgehog pig mongoose mammals kill pouncing unawares avoiding stroke sheer quickness movement probably case snake eating birds 
mongoose quick cases least mentioned one african game trails permits bitten poisonous snakes treating bite utter indifference 
extensive experiments made determine species mongoose immune cobra viper poison 
hedgehogs determined actual experiments pay heed viper poison even bitten tender places tongue lips eat snake radish 
even among animals immune poison different species differently affected different kinds snake poisons 
species resistant others poisons wide variation amount immunity displays given venom 
one species quickly killed poison one species snake fairly resistant poison another whereas another species conditions may directly reversed 
mussurama doctor brazil handed fine specimen perhaps four half feet long 
lifted smooth lithe bulk hands let twist coils rested ease arms glided fro length sinuous grace kind showed slightest trace either nervousness bad temper 
meanwhile doctor bade attendant put table big jararaca fer de lance accordingly done 
jararaca three feet half perhaps nearly four feet long nine inches shorter mussurama 
latter continued hold arms behaved friendly impassive indifference moving easily fro hands twice hiding head sleeve body coat 
doctor quite sure mussurama would behave recently eaten small snake unless hungry pays attention whatever venomous snakes even attack bite 
however fortunately proved still good appetite 
jararaca alert vicious 
partly coiled table threatening bystanders 
put big black serpent table four five feet enemy headed direction 
soon let go hands glided toward threatening formidable looking lance head lay stretched half coil 
mussurama displayed slightest sign excitement 
apparently trusted little eyes began run head along body jararaca darting flickering tongue feel nosed way toward head antagonist 
placid actions first suppose meant attack slightest exhibition anger excitement 
jararaca began fight 
showed fear whatever foe irritable temper aroused proximity actions like flash drew back head struck burying fangs forward part mussurama body 
immediately latter struck return counter attack instantaneous difficult see happened 
tremendous writhing struggling part jararaca leaning knot two serpents twisted saw mussurama seized jararaca lower jaw putting head completely wide gaping mouth poisonous snake 
long fangs top mussurama head appeared well could see driven mussurama without slightest effect 
fangs curved back jaw fact particularly noted effort offensive abandoned poisonous snake 
meanwhile mussurama chewing hard gradually shifted grip little little got top head jararaca mouth lower jaw jararaca spread one side 
venomous serpent helpless fearsome master wild life forest deadly foe humankind held grip death 
cold baleful serpent eyes shone evil ever

vain writhed struggled 
nothing availed 
twice mussurama took turn round middle body opponent seem press hard apparently used coils chiefly order get better grip crush head antagonist hold latter place 
crushing done teeth repeated bites made effort muscles stood mussurama neck 
took two coils round neck jararaca proceeded deliberately try break backbone opponent twisting head round 
purpose twisted head neck round lighter colored surface uppermost indeed one time looked made almost complete single spiral revolution body 
never moment relaxed grip except shift slightly jaws 
minutes jararaca dead head crushed although body continued move convulsively 
satisfied opponent dead mussurama began try get head mouth

finally head taken completely inside swallowed 
mussurama proceeded deliberately unbroken speed devour opponent simple process crawling outside body tail jararaca writhing struggling last

mussurama totally indifferent presence totally indifferent handled meal going 
several times replaced combatants middle table writhed edge finally photographers found could get good pictures held mussurama white background partially swallowed snake mouth feast went uninterruptedly

trip intended hunting trip scientific expedition 
starting trip traveling argentine received certain pieces first hand information concerning natural history jaguar cougar puma worth recording 
facts jaguar new sense casting new light character although interesting facts behavior puma one district patagonia great interest give entirely new side life history 
traveling time doctor francisco p moreno buenos aires 
doctor moreno present day member national board education argentine man worked every way benefit country perhaps especially benefit children first introduced jacob riis argentine know deep affectionate intimacy jacob riis 
also eminent man science done admirable work geologist geographer 
one period connection duties boundary commissioner survey chile argentine worked years patagonia 
made extraordinary discovery patagonian cave still fresh fragments skin remains mylodon aberrant horse known onohipidium huge south american tiger macrauchenia extinct animals 
discovery showed strange representatives giant south american pleistocene fauna lasted within comparatively thousand years time man substantially spaniards found flourished continent 
incidentally discovery tended show fauna lasted much later south america case corresponding faunas parts world therefore tended disprove claims advanced doctor ameghino extreme age geologically fauna extreme antiquity man american continent 
one day doctor moreno handed copy outlook containing account cougar hunt arizona saying noticed little faith cougars attacking men although explicitly stated attacks sometimes occurred 
told yes found cougar practically harmless man undoubtedly authentic instances attacks men exceptional could practice wholly disregarded 
thereupon doctor moreno showed scar face told attacked badly mauled puma undoubtedly trying prey started career man eater 
interesting 
often met men knew men seen men said attacked pumas first time ever come across man attacked 
doctor moreno said eminent citizen eminent scientific man account occurred unquestionably scientifically accurate statement facts 
give exactly doctor told paraphrasing letter sent including one two answers questions put 
doctor way stated known mr hudson author naturalist plata latter knew nothing whatever pumas personal experience accepted facts utterly wild fables 
undoubtedly said doctor puma south america like puma north america general rule cowardly animal never attacks man rarely makes efficient defense attacked 
indian white hunters fear parts country harmlessness man proverbial 
one particular spot southern patagonia cougars doctor personal knowledge years dangerous foes man 
curious local change habits way nothing unprecedented regards wild animals 
portions range informed mr lord smith asiatic tiger hardly forced fight man never preys throughout range dangerous beast often turns man eater 
waters sharks habitual man eaters others never touch men rivers lakes crocodiles caymans dangerous others practically harmless seen africa 
march doctor moreno party men working boundary commission number patagonian horse indians encamped weeks beside lake viedma visited white men century rarely visited even indians 
one morning sunrise left camp south shore lake make topographical sketch lake 
unarmed carried prismatic compass leather case strap 
cold wrapped poncho guanaco hide round neck head 
walked hundred yards puma female sprang behind knocked

continually however tried taking advantage cover sneak one side behind attack 
finally got near camp abandoned pursuit went small patch bushes 
raised alarm indian rode set fire bushes windward side 
cougar broke bushes indian rode threw bolas twisted around hind legs struggling free brained second bolas 
doctor injuries rather painful serious 
twenty one years later april camped lake north shore foot basaltic cliff

fortunately man wrapped blanket night cold injured 
puma never found killed 
time surveyor doctor moreno party swede named arneberg attacked similar fashion 
doctor time 
mr arneberg asleep forest near lake san martin 
cougar bit clawed tore mouth breaking three teeth 
man rescued puma also escaped 
doctor stated particular locality indians elsewhere paid heed whatever puma never let women go wood fuel unless two three together 
several occasions women gone alone killed pumas 
evidently one locality habit least occasional man eating become chronic species elsewhere cowardly man least dangerous big cats 
observations doctor moreno peculiar value far know first trustworthy accounts cougar attacked man save circumstances exceptional make attack signify little similar exceptional instances attack various species wild animals normally dangerous man 
jaguar however long known dangerous foe attacked also become man eater 
therefore instances attacks furnished merely corroborative value 
excellent zoological gardens buenos aires curator doctor onelli naturalist note showed us big male jaguar trapped chaco already begun career man eater killed three persons 
killed two eaten animal trapped consequence alarm excited death third victim

cattle often killed 
jaguar meddle big bull cautious attacking herd accompanied bull times wild game scarce kill every domestic animal

morning january th started tapir hunt 
tapirs hunted canoes dwell thick jungle take water hounds follow 
region extensive papyrus swamps big lagoons back river often tapirs fled refuge throwing hounds 
places exceedingly difficult get best chance keep river canoes paddle toward spot direction hounds noise seemed heading 
started four canoes 
three indian dugouts low water 
fourth canadian canoe beauty light safe roomy made thin slats wood cement covered canvas 
colonel rondon fiala camera went canoe together two paddlers 
paddlers natives poorer class 
good men 
bowsman nearly pure white blood steersman nearly pure negro blood evidently stronger character better man two 
canoes carried couple fazendeiros ranchmen come caceres dogs 
dugouts manned indian half caste paddlers fazendeiros nearly pure white blood also times paddled vigorously 
dressed substantially similar clothes difference camaradas poorer men laborers tatters

alike courteous friendly 
hounds first carried two dugouts let loose banks 
went stream couple hours swift current paddlers making good headway pointed paddles broad blade paddle tipped long point could thrust mud keep low dugout bank 
tropical forest came almost like wall tall trees laced together vines spaces trunks filled low dense jungle 
places could penetrated man machete 
exceptions trees unknown native names told nothing 
foliage thick among exceptions cecropias growing preference new formed alluvial soil bare trees whose rather scanty leaf bunches informed favorite food sloths

colonel strolled one direction returning hour later squirrel naturalists 
meanwhile fiala went palm wood papyrus swamp 
many trails led woods especially along borders swamp although principal makers evidently cattle yet footprints tapir deer 
tapir makes footprint much like small rhinoceros one odd toed ungulates 
could hear dogs evidently scattered running various trails 
worthless lot cur hounds 
would chase tapir deer anything else ran away long trail easy follow stanch even animals fled would nothing whatever animals formidable 
standing marsh heard something coming along one game paths 
moment buck bigger species bush deer appeared pretty graceful creature 
stopped darted back soon saw us giving us chance shot another moment caught glimpses running full speed back among palms 
covered opening two tree trunks 
good luck buck appeared right place giving time hold well ahead fire

leaden portion bullet proper mushroom umbrella shape stopped neck skin farther side 
effective bullet 
miller particularly wished specimens various species bush deer mutual relationships yet satisfactorily worked 
old buck

also seeds berries nuts sometimes found deer stomachs 
species abundant neighborhood solitary habits going herds 
time rut past bucks longer sought fawns born yearlings left mothers animal usually went 
chased apt take water

possible habit kept alive seeking refuge occasion big peccaries among beasts ordinarily preys 
hung buck tree 
colonel returned long afterward one paddlers watching river called us tapir water good distance stream two boats 
jumped canoe two paddlers dug blades water drove strong current edging opposite bank 
tapir coming stream great rate queer head water dugouts closing rapidly paddlers uttering loud cries 
tapir turned slightly one side long slightly upturned snout strongly pronounced arch crest along head upper neck gave marked unusual aspect

antonio parecis said fish never came heavy rapids falls jump 
could hope correct case rapids would encounter future would rarely serious necessitate dragging heavy dugouts overland 
passing rapids hitherto encountered meant severe labor danger

worst rapids ahead us

immediately afterward walkers set march downstream looking good canoe trees 
quarter hour followed canoes

soon found fresh indian sign actually heard indians latter fled panic 
came little indian fishing village abandoned

following day th men began work canoes 
ill fated big canoe made wood hard difficult work heavy chips sank like lead water 
trees araputangas wood easier work floated 
great buttresses flanges jutted trunks base bore big hard nuts fruits stood erect ends branches 
first tree felled proved rotten moreover chopped smashed number lesser trees kitchen overthrowing everything inflicting serious damage 
hardworking willing tough though camaradas naturally skill northern lumberjacks 
hoped finish two canoes three days 
space cleared forest tents 
among taller trees grew huge leafed pacovas wild bananas 
bathed swam river although caught piranhas 
carregadores ants swarmed around camp 
many nearest holes could stopped fire night got tents ate things could ill spare 
early morning column foraging ants appeared drove back also fire 
sky overcast sun hot spread everything dry 
many wonderful butterflies round birds 
yet early morning late afternoon attractive bird music woods 
two best performers old friend false bellbird series ringing whistles shy attractive ant thrush 
latter walked much ground dainty movements curtseying raising tail accent sequence although tone time song resembled white throated sparrow 
three weeks since started river doubt 
come along winding course kilometres descent somewhere neighborhood metres 
slow progress 
could tell physical obstacles ahead us whether indians would actively hostile 
river normally describes course parabola steep descent upper part hoped future encounter many difficult rapids already encountered therefore would make better time hope destined failure

next day lyra kermit camaradas brought five canoes left camp 
four days accomplished work incredible labor utmost importance first glance seemed absolute impossibility avoid abandoning canoes found river sank cataract broken torrent bottom canyon like gorge steep mountains 
april started wondering soon strike rapids mountains ahead whether reasonable time aneroid indicated low necessarily plain could make journey least days without rapids 
exactly month going uninterrupted succession rapids 
month come kilometres descended nearly metres figures approximate fairly accurate 
lost four canoes started one built life one man life dog death probability saved life colonel rondon 
straight line northward toward supposed destination made mile quarter day cost bitter toil party much risk party risk hardship party 
camaradas downhearted naturally enough occasionally asked one us really believed ever get alive cheer best could 
change work time 
made three kilometres day 
party walked time dugouts carried luggage struck head series rapids take next two three days 
river rushed wild gorge chasm canyon two mountains 
sides steep mere rock walls although places covered luxuriant growth trees bushes clung crevices green moss naked rock hardly seen 
rondon lyra kermit front found small level spot beach sand sent back word camp spent several hours exploring country ahead 
canoes run empty loads carried painfully along face cliffs bad trail found rather hard follow although carrying nothing rifle cartridge bag 
explorers returned information mountains stretched ahead us rapids far gone 
could hope aneroid hopelessly kilter therefore fairly soon find comparatively level country 
severe toil rather limited food supply telling strength well spirits men lyra kermit addition work performed much actual physical labor 
next day rd april began descent sinister rapids chasm 
colonel rondon gone summit mountain order find better trail burden bearers hopeless go along face cliffs 
exploring expedition engaged necessity involves hard dangerous labor perils many kinds 
follow stream unknown river broken innumerable cataracts rapids rushing mountains existence never even guessed bears resemblance whatever following even fairly dangerous river thoroughly explored become sort highway experienced pilots secured guides portages pioneered trails chopped every dangerous feature rapids known beforehand 
case one could foretell river would cleave way steep mountain chains cutting narrow clefts cliff walls rose almost sheer either hand 
rushing river thus canyons used say west mountains steep becomes almost impossible bring canoes river utterly impossible portage along cliff sides even bring loads mountain task extraordinary labor difficulty 
moreover one tell many times task repeated end whether food hold every hour work rapids fraught possibility gravest disaster yet imperatively necessary attempt done uninhabited wilderness else wilderness tenanted unfriendly savages failure get means death disease starvation 
wholesale disasters south american exploring parties frequent 
first recent effort descend one unknown rivers amazon brazilian highlands resulted disaster 
undertaken party large brazilian engineer officer colonel telles peres

lyra kermit cherrie four men worked canoes half way canyon

lyra water days 
clothes never dry

bruises feet legs become sores 
bodies insect bites become festering wounds indeed case us 
poisonous ants biting flies ticks wasps bees perpetual torment 
however one yet bitten venomous serpent scorpion centipede although killed three within camp limits 
conditions whatever evil men natures comes front 
day strange terrible tragedy occurred 
one camaradas man pure european blood man named julio already spoken 
powerful fellow importunately eager come expedition reputation good worker 
like many men higher standing idea expedition really meant strain toil hardship danger nature showed true depths selfishness cowardice ferocity 
shirked work 
shammed sickness 
nothing could make share yet unlike self respecting fellows always shamelessly begging favors 
kermit one party smoked continually giving little tobacco camaradas worked especially well 
good men ask julio shirked every labor always always vain demanding 
colonel rondon lyra kermit tried get work order anything threaten leave wilderness 
threw tasks comrades moreover stole food well 
expedition theft food comes next murder crime rights punished 
could trust cut palms gather nuts would stay eat ought gone common store 
finally men several occasions detected stealing food 
alone whole party thanks stolen food kept full flesh bodily vigor 
one best men huge negro named paixao paishon corporal acting sergeant engineer corps 
way literally torn trousers pieces wore tatters pair old drawers gave spare trousers lightened loads 
stern disciplinarian 
one evening detected julio stealing food smashed mouth 
julio came crying us face working fear malignant hatred investigation told gotten uncommonly lightly 
men three four carbines sometimes carried owners 
morning outset portage pedrinho discovered julio stealing men dried meat 
shortly afterward paishon rebuked usual lagging behind 
time reached place canoes tied bank taken one time 
sitting waiting last loads brought along trail 
pedrinho still camp left 
paishon brought load left ground carbine beside returned trail another load 
julio came put load picked carbine walked back trail muttering showing excitement 
thought nothing always muttering occasionally one men saw monkey big bird tried shoot never surprising see man carbine 
minute heard shot short time three four men came trail tell us paishon dead shot julio fled woods 
colonel rondon lyra ahead sent messenger directed cherrie kermit stay guard canoes provisions started trail doctor absolutely cool plucky man revolver rifle couple camaradas 
soon passed dead body poor paishon 
lay huddle pool blood fallen shot heart 
feared julio run amuck intended merely take lives died would begin pedrinho alone unarmed camp left 
accordingly pushed followed companions looking sharply right left came camp doctor quietly walked remarking eyes better colonel sight point rifle 
however others soon joined us welcome news found carbine 
murderer stood one side path killed victim dozen paces deliberate malignant purpose 
evidently murderous hatred given way innate cowardice perhaps hearing one coming along path fled panic terror wilderness 
tree knocked carbine hand 
footsteps showed going rods started return doubtless carbine fled probably body discovered 
questionable whether would live reach indian villages probably goal 
man feel remorse never common feeling surely murderer living hell fever famine leering shadows made way empty desolation wilderness 
franca cook quoted melancholy proverbial philosophy people proverb man knows heart one expressed deep conviction weird ghostly belief never encountered paishon following julio follow dies paishon fell forward hands knees murdered man falls like ghost follow slayer long slayer lives 
attempt pursue murderer 
could legally put death although soldier cold blood deliberately killed fellow soldier 
near civilization would done best bring turn justice 
wilderness many weeks journey ahead us could tell 
food running low sickness beginning appear among men courage strength gradually ebbing 
first duty save lives health men expedition honestly performing still perform much perilous labor 
brought murderer would guarded night day expedition always loaded firearms would continually opportunity temptation make effort seize food weapon escape perhaps murdering good man 
could shackled climbing along cliff slopes could shackled canoes always chance upset drowning standing guard would additional severe penalty weary honest men already exhausted overwork 
expedition peril wise take every chance possible would help secure success 
whether murderer lived died wilderness moment compared duty everything secure safety rest party 
two days following always watch return could readily killed one else rolling rocks men working cliff sides bottom gorge 
see morning third day 
passed last rapids chasm four boats going stream appeared behind trees bank called wished surrender taken aboard murderer arrant craven heart strange mixture ferocity cowardice 
colonel rondon boat far advance stop answer 
kept similar fashion rear boats intention taking murderer aboard jeopardy members party unless colonel rondon told would done pursuance duty officer army servant government brazil 
first halt colonel rondon came told view duty stopped wished first consult chief expedition 
answered reasons enumerated believe justice good men expedition jeopardize safety taking murderer along responsibility mine refuse take colonel rondon superior officer murderer enlisted men army officers expedition return responsible actions governmental superiors laws brazil view responsibility must act sense duty bade 
accordingly next camp sent back two men expert woodsmen find murderer bring 
failed find 
note account circumstances connected murder read approved correct six members expedition 
anticipated narrative wish recur horror necessary 
return story 
found julio fled returned scene tragedy 
murdered man lay handkerchief thrown face

next day made another long portage round rapids camped night still hot wet sunless atmosphere gorge
