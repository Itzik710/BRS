preface 
strong proof diffusive tendency every thing country america never yet collected fleet 
nothing wanting display power 
fleet requires one commander feeling fast spreading country ought commanders unless spirit unconstitutional innovation usurpation prevalent washington controlled may expect hear proposals send committee congress sea command squadron 
sincerely hope first experiment may made coast africa 
said napoleon never could made understand fleets obey orders accuracy time place corps arm e 
made allowances winds currents least comprehend important circumstance efficiency fleet necessarily confined rate sailing dullest ships 
may expected squadron ten sail shall average vessels respect number vessels one half fast remainder dull 
one brigade march fast another vessels 
efficiency marine therefore depends rather working qualities number ships 
perhaps best fleet ever sailed english flag nelson fought battle nile 
consisted twelve thirteen small seventy fours approved qualities commanded officer known merit 
respects efficient reliable 
men hallowell hood trowbridge foley ball others ships great spirit nelson satisfied 
knew whatever seamen could comparatively little force could achieve 
enemy discovered anchor though night approaching vessels good deal scattered determined put qualities mentioned highest proof attack 
done without order battle directed commander get close alongside enemy possible best proof high confidence ships commanders 
known early accounts man oe uvring nile nelson reasoning subject anchoring inside doubling enemies pure fiction 
life southey relates feature day pure fiction indeed portions work scarcely less importance 
fact came writer late commodore charles valentine morris sir alexander ball early part century 
day would done proclaim tenacious public opinion errors since time naval officers rank written subject stripped nile trafalgar c poetry give world plain nautical probable accounts great achievements 
truth relates battles little like previously published accounts well could 
nelson knew great superiority english seamen facility repairing damages high advantage possessed fleets country exercise assumed right impress practice put best seamen country whole world less mercy 
great merit nile appreciation advantages extraordinary decision led go action nightfall rather give enemy time prepare meet shock 
known french taken great measure surprise 
large portion crews shore get ships scarce vessel clear decks tumbling mess chests bags c inside batteries rendering measure useless english doubled line 
doubling french line anchoring inside putting two ships upon one gave nelson high reputation tactician 
merit man oe uvre belongs exclusively one captains 
fleet went without order keeping much windward shoals would permit nelson ordered vanguard hove take pilot fisherman 
enabled foley hood one two pass fast ship 
critical moment thought occurred foley think officer pass head french line keep dead away anchor inside 
others followed completely placing enemies two fires 
sir samuel hood anchored ship zealous inner bow weatherly french ship poured fire virtually unresisting enemy 
notwithstanding great skill manifested english mode attack two decked ship english fleet able make sail following morning 
nelson led upon american fleet upon french nile would seen reason repent boldness experiment 
something like attempted lake champlain though greatly diminished scale english virtually defeated anchored 
reader feels interest subjects probably detect secret process mind foregoing facts insinuated fiction

events relate occurred near middle last century previously even struggle fashion america call old french war 
opening scene tale however must sought hemisphere coast mother country 
middle eighteenth century american colonies models loyalty war allusion causing great expenditure induced ministry recourse system taxation terminated revolution 
family quarrel yet commenced 
intensely occupied conflict terminated gloriously british arms advantageously british american possessions inhabitants provinces perhaps never better disposed metropolitan state period write 
early predilections seemed gaining strength instead becoming weaker nature calm known succeed tempest blind attachment colony parent country precursor alienation violent disunion soon follow 
although superiority english seamen well established conflicts took place years naval warfare period means possessed decided character became stamped quarter century later 
times british marine appears improved quality enemies deteriorated 
year however greek met greek verity came tug war 
great change came navies europe merely consequence revolutions drove experienced men exile rendering armies important even existence different states threw nautical enterprises shade gave engrossing direction courage talent another quarter 
france struggling first independence next mastery continent marine secondary object vienna berlin moscow easily entered without aid 
similar causes must referred explanation seeming invincibility english arms sea late great conflicts europe invincibility apparent real however many well established defeats even intermingled thousand victories 
time numbers could furnish succor nature day separation america full share exploits english marine 
gentry colonies willingly placed sons royal navy many bit square bunting flying royal mast heads king ships nineteenth century distinguishing symbols flag officers look birth places among 
course chequered life brought collision great diversity rank professions characters often falls lot one individual thrown contact less eight english admirals american birth never yet good fortune meet countryman rank bestowed government 
one occasion englishman filled highest civil office connected marine nation observed us man knew british navy feel entire confidence entrusting important command one translated admirals thought unavoidably passed mind favorite commander done well adhering conventional instead clinging natural allegiance inasmuch might toiled half century service native land rewarded rank would merely put level colonel army much longer short sighted policy grievous injustice continue man say safe believe last legislator influence learns simple truth fancied reluctance popular constituencies right oftener exists apprehensions representatives reality 
tale 
england enjoys wide spread reputation fogs little know much fog may add natural scenery never witnessed magical effects caused beautiful landscape coquette eye playful capricious changes 
opening scene one much derided fogs though let always remembered fog june november

good many wychecombes england wonder family tell hundredth cousin good heir first born son 
failing nearer kin

learning line baronets name every pretender family would apt call son wycherly 
line shortly ended brother returned sir wycherly sighing 
wish might mistaken tom prove filius call 
mr baron wychecombe much esprit de corps moral principle man strict integrity things related meum tuum 
particularly rigid notions concerning transmission real estate rights primogeniture 
world taken little interest private history lawyer sons born elevation bench passed public widower family promising boys 
one hundred acquaintances even suspected fact nothing would easier imposed brother inducing make legal mystification caused tom wychecombe succeed property question indisputable title 
would great difficulty even son assuming maintaining right baronetcy inasmuch would competitor crown officers particularly rigid inquiring claims assumed title brought political privileges 
still far indulging project 
appeared wychecombe estate ought go principles usually governed matters although submitted dictum common law regarded provision excluded half blood inheriting deference english common law lawyer saw felt failing direct line wychecombe ought revert descendants sir michael second son plain reason much derived person acquired estate brother wycherly 
descendants females even interfere opinion would existed escheat devise favor filius nillius descendant filius nullius half blood possessed every possible advantage
