somehow new tale every week half zest stories fresh book came house rare much prized chances though paper smooth blue red lovely half nice draw paint sylvia helping remains mary rubbings making illuminations nay lily spoiling everything armyn charlie laughing remembered ingredients pleasure would hardly heart go drawing could still send pictorial stories sylvia receive remarks 
lady ethelindas flounces kate drawings heroines always clergymen daughters colonists cutting trees making butter
