large native beasts discovered warlock terran explorers 
four five different species none proved hostile unprovoked 
mean somewhere back wild lands shann heading heretofore unknowns perhaps slyer vicious wolverines aroused rage 
dreams afforded prime source camp discussion dispute 
shann brushed coarse sand boots thought dreams 
exist could start argument time making definite statement peculiar sort dreaming reported first scout set ship world 
circe system warlock second three planets first scouted four years ago one explorers traveling solo survey service 
everyone knew first scouts weird breed almost mutation terran stock reports rife strange observations 
alarming one concerning circe yellow sun sol three planets rare 
witch world nearest orbit circe hot human occupancy without drastic costly world changing

speeded process declaring warlock open 
ragnar thorvald protested decision last gone back headquarters supply ship month ago make last appeal careful study 
shann stopped brushing sand tough fabric knee

wild dreams born minute two realized ensuing months 
probably dreams always wild ones reported first scout warlock 
shann grinned wryly short period childish hope half confidence could big things 
one thorvald ever noticed shann existence survey camp garth 
garth thorvald far less impressive one could say smudged copy brother 
swaggering arrogance ragnar never showed garth cadet first mission intent upon making shann realize unbridgeable gulf labor hand officer

always sure could take garth mixed 
loosed tight rein kept temper offered challenge would lost chance survey 
garth proved able talk way scrape even minor derelictions duty far ranked shann 
laborer tyr swallow could dish hope next assignment would member young thorvald team

two terrans warlock need know 
thorvald staring back blankness non recognition

thorvald made weapon quick twist 
shann utter astonishment survey officer walked back kneel beside dead throg 
worked grip blaster alien lax claws inspected result care one arranging special highly important display 
shann protest became vocal 
need us far good right thorvald paused added impatience roughening voice disliked need making explanations reason us advertise alive 
throgs found blaster missing start thinking looking around 
want breathing spell play quarry one hunts 
put way action make sense 
shann regretted loss arm superior weapons 
could loot plateship either 
silence turned started trudge southward without waiting thorvald catch 
away blasted area wolverines ranged ahead clumsy gallop covered ground surprising rate speed 
shann knew curiosity made scouts surpassing human men followed would ample warning danger come 
without reference silent trail companion sent animals toward another strip woodland would give cover coming throg flyer 
hours advanced began cast proper night camp 
woods ought give usable site 
water wood thorvald said breaking silence first time since left wrecks

native race warlock 
thorvald tossed improvised stone ax hand hand 
throgs know implications possibilities idea struck home shann 
began understand thorvald might planning 
going native race 
shann made statement instead question saw watching new intentness last recognized person instead rank file low rank survey personnel 
going native race thorvald affirmed 
shann resheathed knife went search pond beach suitable stone use place 
even made harder work clumsy chopping thorvald 
worried one sapling another hands skinned breath came painful gusts aching ribs 
thorvald gone another task ripping end long tough vine powdery surface thick leaf masses fallen years 
officer lashed together tops poles planted splintered butts ground achieved crudely conical erection 
leafy branches woven back forth framework entrance one might crawl hands knees left facing lakeside 
shelter completed compact efficient totally unlike anything shann ever seen certainly far removed domes camp

old form thorvald replied native primitive race terra 
certainly beetle heads come across like 
going stay otherwise pretty heavy work one night lodging 
thorvald tested shelter sharp shake 
matted leaves whispered framework held

evidence support play 
even throg dense enough believe natives would make cross country trip without leaving evidence passing 
shann sat sigh made effort suppress

already survey officer busy new problem 
need weapons stunners force ax knives shann pointed 
add would liked could blaster

regulation shann countered defensively 
regulation thorvald agreed 
set stones row tossed supply bag companion 
late hunt tonight 
well go easy rations get 
thorvald know supply cache could raid throgs answered matter factly 
eat kind food reason leave camp supplies untouched 
camp first time thorvald lips curved shadow smile neither joyous warming 
native raid invaders camp 
could natural better make soon 
shann proposed sheer madness 
ancient service corps terra thorvald answered motto something like improbable impossible takes little longer 
think going sulk around bush let throgs claim warlock one pirate bases without opposition since future shann visualized ready enough admit truth shade tone officer voice kept saying aloud 

sortie five days later came south time shann view terran camp different angle 
first sight little change general scene 
wondered aliens using terran dome shelters 
even twilight easy pick landmarks com dome shaft broadcaster spearing top greater bulk supply warehouse 
two small flyers landing field thorvald materialized shadow voice thread whisper 
shann side wolverines moving restlessly 
since taggi attack throg neither beast would venture near site could scent aliens 
nearest point men could urge either animal disappointment wolverines would excellent addition surprise sortie planned tonight halving danger men 
shann ran fingers across coarse fur animals shoulders exerting light pressure signal wait 
sure obedience 
foray crazy idea shann wondered agreed 
yet gone along thorvald even suggested modifications additions contents crude leaf sack resting knees 
thorvald flitted away seeking post west 
shann still waiting signal arose camp sound chill flesh listener wail could come throat normal living thing intelligent animal 
ululating ear torturing intensity cry sank faint ominous echo waver scale

making efforts douse fires shann knew careful experimentation ignited stuff skimmed lip one hot springs would go burning long fraction viscid substance remained unconsumed 
thorvald gone action 
throg suddenly halted struggled frantically toppled edge fire splotch legs looped together coils curious weapon thorvald put together first night partnership 
three round stones comparable weight fastened end vine cord cords united center point 
thorvald demonstrated effectiveness creation bringing one small deer grasslands animal normally fleet enough feel safe human animal pursuit 
weighted ropes trapped throg efficiency 
shot last fireball shann ran swiftly take new position downgrade east domes 
put action another primitive weapons thorvald devised spear hurled throwing stick giving double range twice forceful penetration power 
spears hardly crudely shaped lengths wood points charred fire 
perhaps missiles could neither kill seriously wound 
one thudded home satisfactory fashion curving back carapace softer front parts throg manner certainly shook bruised target 
one shann victims went ground lie kicking way suggested bruised 
fireballs spears thorvald moved 
somewhat frantic melee aroused camp fell shower slim weighted reeds provided clay ball head
