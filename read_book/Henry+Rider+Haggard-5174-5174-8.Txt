still sometimes inyangas tell one strange things 
led hans crept round house five foot stone wall back stable 
beyond wall within circle huts kaffirs lived open space ant heap floor cooking 
facing us sat mavovo ring around hunters accompany us also jack lame griqua two house boys 
front mavovo burned number little wood fires 
counted found fourteen reflected exact number hunters plus 
one hunters engaged feeding fires little bits stick handfuls dried grass keep burning brightly 
others sat round perfectly silent watched rapt attention 
mavovo looked like man asleep 
crouched haunches big head resting almost upon knees 
middle snake skin round neck ornament appeared made human teeth 
right side lay pile feathers wings vultures left little heap silver money suppose fees paid hunters divining 
watched shelter behind wall appeared wake sleep 
first muttered looked moon seemed say prayer could catch words 
next shuddered three times convulsively exclaimed clear voice snake come

snake tells also hold tongue matter lest us turned cowards 
tells first ask one must die 
ask ask 
strange say one accepted invitation 
never seen body men indifferent future least every appearance

snake told something else went mavovo 
among company jackal man thinking might one six die dreams avoid fate deserting use 
snake point show deal 
one voice man present declared desertion lord macumazana last thing could possibly occur 
indeed believe brave fellows spoke truth 
doubt put faith mavovo magic fashion race 
still death promised way hoped would one six escape 
moreover zulu days accustomed death fear terrors much 
one however venture advance argument mavovo treated proper contempt shillings paid divination returned next heirs happened decease 
asked pay shilling order told must die seemed unreasonable 
certainly zulu kaffirs queer way looking things 
hans whispered fire among burn yonder baas wheezed back ear 
baas think fool must die must die live shall live 
pay shilling learn time declare moreover yonder mavovo takes shillings frightens everybody tells nobody anything 
call cheating 
baas baas wazela fear 
pay shillings therefore mavovo though without doubt great inyanga really prophesy concerning since snake work without fee

yet gift gift must used 
baba gift shooting cease shoot gift wandering cease wander picked one burnt feathers little pile side looked attentively 
perhaps baba told ears sharp thought heard words floating air poor kaffir inyangas prophesy nothing true unless paid perhaps fact far something moment concerned

also nothing gained time sailors get rascals bolted except friend hassan 
see though sure would hung 
probably escape 
international law subject foreign power direct proof kind thing know 
give minute two said began reflect deeply 
whilst thus engaged several things happened 
saw twenty natives escorted towards us doubtless bearers promised also saw many others accompanied natives flying village bush 
lastly third messenger arrived announced maria sailing away apparently charge prize crew man war putting though accompany 
evidently intention effecting landing upon nominally rate portuguese territory 
therefore anything done must act 
well end like fool accepted stephen advice nothing always easiest course generally leads trouble 
ten minutes afterwards changed mind late crocodile signalling distance 
subsequent conversation hans 
baas said worthy leery fashion think made mistake 
forget yellow devils white robes run away come back return country may waiting 
english man war destroyed town slave sheds might gone somewhere else 
however added afterthought glancing disfigured hassan captain course mean hang baas

chapter vi slave road twenty bearers arrived charge five six arabs armed guns went inspect taking hassan us also hunters 
likely lot men though rather thin scared looking evidently could see physical appearance varying methods dressing hair members different tribes 
delivered arabs rather one entered excited conversation hassan 
sammy hand know said although gathered contemplating rescue 
gave idea began run away companions done 
one however bolder fellow rest turned fired 
missed yards could tell sing bullet arabs execrable shots

next set work get communication bearers thought poor devils sold new master 
may explain slaves meant exportation men kept cultivate hassan gardens 
fortunately found two belonged mazitu people may remembered blood zulus although separated parent stock generations ago

right answered pointing union jack stephen still hand 
also pay return according served us 
yes muttered pay return perhaps englishman 
three clock afternoon able make start 
much arranged might wiser wait till morrow determined could help nothing would induce us spend another night place 
blankets served bearers poor naked creatures seemed quite touched gift loads apportioned already packed durban cases one man could carry 
pack saddles put upon four donkeys proved none worse journey burdens weight lbs 
fixed waterproof hide bags besides cooking calabashes sleeping mats hans produced somewhere 
probably stole deserted village necessary us confess asked questions 
lastly six eight goats wandering captured take us food till could find game 
offered pay hassan handed money threw rage picked put pocket clear conscience 
length everything less ready question arose done hassan 
zulus like hans wished kill sammy explained best arabic 
murderous fellow showed coward heart 
flung upon knees wept invoked us name compassionate allah explained god worshipped till mavovo growing impatient noise threatened kerry whereon became silent 
easy natured stephen letting go plan seemed advantages least rid abominable company 
reflection however decided better take along us rate day hold hostage case arabs follow attack us 
first refused stir assegai one zulu hunters pressed gently remained robe furnished argument could resist 
length 
two guides went ahead 
came bearers half hunters four donkeys charge hans sammy hassan rest hunters except mavovo brought rear stephen 
needless say rifles loaded generally prepared emergency 
path guides said must follow ran seashore hundred yards turned inland hassan village lived seemed old mission house used 
marched along little rocky cliff ten feet high deep water channel perhaps fifty yards breadth separated mainland island whence slaves loaded maria difficulty arose donkeys 
one slipped load another began buck evinced inclination leap sea precious burden 
rearguard hunters ran get hold suddenly splash 
brute thought till shout told ass hassan departed cliff edge 
watching opportunity clear first rate swimmer flung backwards midst confusion falling deep water promptly dived 
twenty yards shore came moment dived heading island 
dare say could potted head snap shot somehow like kill man swimming life though hippopotamus crocodile 
moreover boldness maneuver appealed 
refrained firing called others likewise 
late host approached shore island saw arabs running rocks help water 
either left place occupied soon hms crocodile vanished prize 
clear recapture hassan would involve attack upon garrison island position carry gave orders march resumed 
difficulty donkey overcome obeyed 
fortunate delay scarcely caravan got motion arabs island began fire us 
luckily one hit soon round point cover also shooting bad usual 
one missile however pot leg struck donkey load smashed bottle good brandy tin preserved butter 
made angry motioning others proceed took shelter behind tree waited till torn dirty turban recognized hassan poked rock 
well put bullet turban saw thing fly unfortunately head beneath 
left ppc card host bolted rock caught others 
presently passed round village would go fear ambuscade 
quite big place enclosed strong fence hidden sea rise intervening land 
center large eastern looking house doubtless hassan dwelt harem 
gone little way astonishment saw flames breaking palm leaf roof house

due course truth came 
hunter adventurous spirit slipped gate fence without observed ran across deserted village house stole ornaments money women apartments departed fired place exchange bottle good brandy hans explained 
inclined angry fired hans exploit became act war rather theft 
made companion divide gold equally rest hunters doubt kept eyes conveniently shut forgetting sammy said 
netted apiece pleased much 
addition gave rather goods value bearers share loot 
hassan remarked evidently great agriculturist gardens worked slave labor beautiful must brought large revenue 
passing gardens came sloping land covered bush 
track good creepers hampered progress 
indeed glad towards sunset reached crest hill emerged upon tableland almost clear trees rose gradually till met horizon 
bush might easily attacked open country much afraid since loss arabs would great overpowered 
matter fact although spies dogged us days assault ever attempted 
finding convenient place stream camped night fine pitch tents 
afterwards sorry gone water since mosquitoes bred millions marshes bordering stream gave us dreadful time 
poor stephen fresh england fell peculiar ferocity result morning bruises left hassan bites spectacle men angels 
another thing broke rest necessity keeping strict watch case slave traders elect attack us hours darkness also guard possibility bearers running away perhaps stealing goods 
true went sleep explained clearly attempted give us slip would certainly seen shot whereas remained us would treated every kindness 
answered two mazitu nowhere go wish fall power hassan spoke literally shudders pointing scarred backs marks slave yokes upon necks 
protestations seemed indeed proved sincere course could sure

postman call long 
happened within days see slave caravan merchandise estimable hassan 
making good progress beautiful healthy country steering almost due west rather little north west 
land undulating rich well watered bush clad neighborhood streams higher ground open park like character dotted trees 
evident long ago population dense came remains many villages rather towns large market places 
however burned fire deserted occupied old bodies got living overgrown gardens 
poor people sat desolate crooning sun perhaps worked feebly fertile fields would fly screaming approach men armed guns must necessity slave traders 
still time time contrived catch one member party get stories 
really one story 
slaving arabs pretext set tribe tribe 
sided stronger conquered weaker aid terrible guns killing old folk taking young men women children except infants butchered sold slaves 
seemed business begun twenty years hassan ben mohammed companions arrived kilwa drove away missionary built station 
first trade extremely easy profitable since raw material lay near hand plenty 
degrees however neighbouring communities worked 
countless numbers killed pick population passed slave yoke survived vanished ships unknown lands 
thus came slavers obliged go afield even conduct raids upon borders territory great mazitu people inland race zulu origin spoken 
according informants even rumored proposed shortly attack mazitus force relying guns give victory open new almost inexhaustible store splendid human merchandise 
meanwhile cleaning certain small tribes hitherto escaped owing fact residence bush among difficult hills 
track followed recognized slave road 
soon became aware numbers skeletons found lying tall grass side heavy slave sticks still upon wrists 
suppose died exhaustion others split skulls showed disposed captors 
eighth day march struck track slave caravan 
traveling towards coast reason turned back 
may leaders warned approach party 
perhaps heard another caravan work different district drawing near bringing slaves wished wait arrival order might join forces 
spoor people easy follow 
first found body boy ten 
vultures revealed us remains two young men one shot killed blow axe 
corpses roughly hidden beneath grass know 
mile two heard child wailing found following cries 
little girl four pretty though living skeleton 
saw us scrambled away fours like monkey 
stephen followed sick heart went get tin preserved milk stores 
presently heard call horrified voice 
rather reluctantly knew must found something dreadful pushed way bush 
bound trunk tree sat young woman evidently mother child clung leg 
thank god still living though must died another day dawned 
cut loose zulu hunters kind folk enough war carried camp 
end much trouble saved lives mother child 
sent two mazitus could talk fairly well asked slavers things 
shrugged shoulders one answered rather dreadful laugh chief arabs black hearted kill walk tie die 
let go might recover escape makes arabs sad slaves live free happy 
indeed exclaimed stephen snort rage reminded father 
well ever get chance make sad vengeance 
stephen tender hearted young man soft indolent ways awkward customer roused 
within forty eight hours got chance thus day camped early two reasons 
first woman child rescued wee weak could walk without rest men spare carry second came ideal spot pass night 
usual deserted village ran beautiful stream water 
took possession outlying huts fence round mavovo managed shoot fat eland cow half grown calf prepared regular feast 
whilst sammy making broth rescued woman stephen smoked pipes watched hans slipped broken gate thorn fence boma announced arabs coming two lots many slaves 
ran look saw said two caravans approaching rather reached village distance us camping market place 
one whose track followed although last hours march struck away chiefly could bear sights described 
seemed comprise two hundred fifty slaves forty guards black men carrying guns dress arabs bastard arabs 
second caravan approached another direction one hundred slaves twenty thirty captors 
said let us eat dinner like go call upon gentlemen show afraid 
hans get flag tie top tree show country belong 
went union jack duly presently glasses saw slavers running state excitement also saw poor slaves turn stare bit flapping bunting begin talk 
struck possible someone among number seen union jack hands english traveller heard flying upon ships points coast meant slaves 
may understood remarks arabs doubt pointed explanatory 
rate turned stared till arabs ran among sjambocks whips hippopotamus hide suppressed animated conversation many blows 
first thought would break camp march away indeed began make preparations abandoned idea probably slaves exhausted water could reach nightfall 
end settled lit cooking fires 
also observed took precautions attack stationing sentries forcing slaves construct boma thorns camp 
well said stephen finished dinner ready call answered think 
considering things concluded better leave well alone 
time arabs know story dealings worthy master hassan doubt sent messengers 
therefore go camp may shoot us sight 
receive us well may offer hospitality poison us cut throats suddenly 
position might better still one believe would find difficult take 
opinion better stop still await developments 
stephen grumbled something cautious took heed 
one thing however 
sending hans told take one mazitu dared risk guides another natives borrowed hassan bold fellow knew local languages creep slavers camp soon quite dark 
ordered find could possible mix slaves explain friends 
hans nodded exactly kind task appealed went make preparations 
stephen also made preparations way strengthening defences building large watch fires setting sentries 
night fell hans companions departed stealthily snakes 
silence intense save occasional wailings slaves broke bursts melancholy sound la lu la lua died away followed horrid screams arabs laid lashes upon poor wretch 
shot fired 
seen hans said stephen 
think answered would one shot 
either accident murdering slave 
nothing happened long till length hans seemed rise ground front behind saw figures mazitu man 
tell story said 
baas 
us learned everything 
arabs know men 
hassan sent orders kill 
well go visit certainly would murdered 
crept near overheard talk 
purpose attack us dawn morrow morning unless leave place know watched 
asked 
baas attack making caravan immediately afterwards begin march 
indeed 
anything hans yes baas 
two men crept among slaves spoke 
sad slaves many died heart pain taken homes know going 
saw one die young woman 
talking another woman seemed quite well tired till suddenly said loud voice going die may come back spirit bewitch devils till spirits 
called upon fetish tribe put hands breast fell dead 
least added hans spitting reflectively fall quite slave stick held head ground 
arabs angry cursed dead 
one came kicked body afterwards shot little boy sick mother cursed 
fortunately see us dark far fire 
anything hans one thing baas 
two men lent knives gave two boldest among slaves might cut cords slave sticks cords tied pass lines brothers might 
perhaps arabs find mazitu must lose knives 

baas little tobacco stephen said hans gone explained everything two courses open us 
either try give gentlemen slip case must leave woman child fate stop wait attacked 
run said stephen sullenly would cowardly desert poor creature 
also worse chance marching 
remember hans said watching us 
would wait attacked third alternative quatermain attack idea said 
let us send mavovo 
presently came sat front us set case 
fashion people attack rather attacked yet father case heart 
hans called inblatu zulu word means spotted snake hottentot kaffir name says quite sixty yellow dogs armed guns whereas fifteen trust slave men 
also says within strong fence awake spies difficult surprise 
father strong fence surprised 
also men torture kill women children except war must think cowards come faintly good shooting indeed come 
therefore say wait till buffalo shall either charge run 
word macumazana wise watcher night hunter 
speak old war obey 
argue well answered also another reason comes mind 
arab brutes may get behind slaves butcher lot without hurting 
stephen think better see thing 
right quatermain 
hope mavovo wrong thinking blackguards may change minds run away 
really young man becoming blood thirsty orchid grower remarked looking 
part devoutly hope mavovo right let tell may nasty job 
always peaceful enough present replied stephen 
sight unhappy wretches slaves heads cut open woman tied tree starve make wish usurp functions god almighty said 
well natural impulse perhaps circumstances one displease 
made minds going let get business arab gentlemen may find breakfast ready come call 
chapter vii rush slaves well could way making ready 
strengthened thorn fence boma much possible lit several large fires outside give us light allotted place hunters saw rifles order plenty ammunition 
made stephen lie sleep telling would wake watch later 
however intention wanted rise fresh steady nerve occasion first fight 
soon saw eyes shut sat box think 
tell truth altogether happy mind 
begin know twenty bearers would behave fire 
might seized panic rush case determined let boma take chance panic catching thing 
worse matter rather awkward position 
good many trees round camp among attacking force could take cover 
feared much even reedy banks stream along could creep reach bullets sloping stretch land behind us covered thick grass scrub rising crest two hundred yards away 
arabs got round crest would fire straight boma make untenable 
also wind favor might burn us attack clouds smoke 
matter fact special mercy providence none things happened reason explain presently 
case night rather dawn attack always found hour sky begins lighten trying indeed 
rule everything done done one must sit idle 
also physical moral qualities lowest ebb mercury thermometer 
night dying day yet born 
nature feels influence hour 
bad dreams come infants wake call memories lost us arise hesitating soul often takes plunge depths unknown 
wonderful therefore occasion wheels time drave heavily 
knew morning hand many signs 
sleeping bearers turned muttered sleep distant lion ceased roaring departed place alert minded cock crew somewhere donkeys rose began pull tether ropes 
yet however quite dark 
hans crept saw wrinkled yellow face light watch fire 
smell dawn said vanished 
mavovo appeared massive frame silhouetted blackness 
watcher night night done said 
come enemy soon 
saluting passed away dark presently heard sounds spear blades striking together rifles cocked 
went stephen woke 
sat yawning muttered something greenhouses remembering said arabs coming fight last 
jolly old fellow jolly old fool answered inconsequently marched rage 
mind uneasy inexperienced young man 
anything happen say father well event probable something would happen 
possibly dead hour 
certainly intention allowing taken alive slaving devils 
hassan remarks fires ant heaps sun vividly impressed upon memory 
another five minutes everybody though required kicks rouse bearers slumbers 
poor men accustomed presence death suffer disturb sleep 
still noted muttered together seemed alarmed 
show signs treachery must kill said mavovo nodded grave silent fashion 
left rescued slave woman child plunged stupor exhaustion corner camp 
use disturbing sammy seemed far comfortable brought two pannikins coffee stephen 
momentous occasion messrs quatermain somers said gave us coffee noted hand shook teeth chattered 
cold extreme went copybook english way explaining physical symptoms saw observed 
mr quatermain well paw ground smell battle afar written book job 
brought trade take otherwise 
indeed wish back cape yes even within whitewashed walls place detention 
muttered keeping right foot ground difficulty 
stephen laughed outright asked sammy fighting begins mr somers answered employed wakeful hours making hole behind tree trunk hope bullets pass 
man peace shall pray success 
arabs get sammy sir heaven shall trust fleetness legs 
could stand longer right foot flew caught sammy place aimed 
vanished casting reproachful look behind 
terrible clamor arose slavers camp hitherto silent also first light dawn glinted barrels guns 
look cried gulped last coffee something going 
clamor grew louder louder till seemed fill skies concentrated noise curses shrieking 
distinct heard shouts alarm rage came sounds gunshots yells agony thud many running feet 
light growing fast comes latitudes 
three minutes gray mist dawn saw dozens black figures struggling slope towards us 
seemed logs wood tied behind others crawled along fours others dragged children hand yelled top voices 
slaves attacking us said stephen lifting rifle 
shoot cried 
think broken loose taking refuge us 
right 
unfortunates used two knives men smuggled good purpose 
cut bonds night running seek protection englishmen flag 
surged hideous mob slave sticks still fast necks many found time opportunity loose behind came arabs firing 
position clearly serious burst camp overwhelmed rush fall victims bullets captors 
hans cried take men last night try lead slaves round behind us 
quick quick stamped flat 
hans darted away presently saw two men running towards approaching crowd hans waving shirt white object attract attention 
time foremost halted screaming mercy english save us english caught sight muzzles guns 
fortunate occurrence indeed otherwise hans companions could never stopped 
next thing saw white shirt bearing away left line led past fence boma scrub high grass behind camp 
struggled scrambled crowd slaves like flock sheep bell wether 
hans shirt kind white helmet navarre 
danger passed 
slaves struck arab bullets trodden rush collapsed weakness still lived pursuers firing

fight began 
except grand finale really much fight compared one two afterwards expedition 
hand character extremely awkward us 
arabs made one rush beginning shouting allah came 
though plucky villains repeat experiment 
either good luck good management stephen knocked two double barrelled rifle also emptied large bore breech loader first ever owned among without results hunters made hit two 
arabs took cover getting behind trees feared hiding reeds banks stream 
thence harassed us great deal amongst decent shots 
indeed taken precaution lining thorn fence thick bank earth sods fared badly 
one hunters killed bullet passing loophole striking throat fire unfortunate bearers rather higher ground suffered good deal two dispatched outright four wounded 
made rest lie flat ground close fence fashion could fire bodies 
soon became evident arabs thought quite fifty firing different places 
moreover slow degrees advancing evident object outflanking us gaining high ground behind 
course stopped rushed cover cover kind shooting difficult bolting rabbits across woodland ride honest must say alone much good game quick eye long practice told 
within hour position grown serious indeed much found necessary consider done 
pointed small number charge scattered riflemen gradually surrounding us would worse useless almost hopeless expect hold boma till nightfall 
arabs got behind us could rake us higher ground 
indeed last half hour directed efforts preventing passing boma fortunately stream one side stretch quite open land made difficult without loss cared face 
fear one thing said length pause attack arabs either taking counsel waiting ammunition abandon camp everything bolt hill 
fellows must tired good runners may save lives way 
wounded asked stephen slave woman child know answered looking

confess assent wishing stephen especially stephen potted obscure engagement miserable slave traders something happened 
remembered shortly dawn hans using shirt flag led fugitive slaves past camp hill behind

sudden reappeared still waving shirt 
rushed great mob naked men two hundred perhaps brandishing slave sticks stones boughs trees 
almost reached boma whence watched amazed split two bodies half passing left apparently command mazitu accompanied hans slave camp half right following old hottentot

ah said mavovo spotted snake referred hans great way even able put courage hearts slaves 
understand father attack arabs yes pull wild dogs buffalo calf true hottentot superb design 
moreover succeeded 
hillside watched progress fight seen must end 
interpreter harangued slaves pointing white friends overwhelmed must either strike return yoke 
among warriors tribes stirred others 
seized slave sticks freed pieces rock anything came hands given signal charged leaving women children behind 
seeing come scattered arabs began fire killing thereby revealing hiding places 
slaves rushed 
hurled upon arabs tore dashed brains fashion within another five minutes quite two thirds dead rest took toll rifles bolted cover full flight 
terrible vengeance 
never witness savage scene outraged men wreaking wrongs upon tormentors 
remember arabs killed escaped slaves found one think captain gang hidden little patch dead reeds washed stream 
somehow managed fire expect hans remained discreetly background fighting began emerged gave match 
due course came wretched arab 
flung marching ants upon caterpillar despite cries mercy tore fragments literally fragments 
hard blame 
seen parents shot infants pitilessly butchered homes destroyed women children marched slave sticks sold bondage done think although ignorant savages 
thus lives saved tried save justice done even dark parts africa time dark indeed 
hans courage managed inspire hearts crushed blacks little doubt nightfall dead think attempt retreat would proved successful 
would happened us wild country surrounded enemies rounds ammunition could carried flight ah baas said hottentot little later squinting bead like eyes well listen prayer bring 
old hans drunkard yes least used old hans gambles yes perhaps old hans go hell 
meanwhile old hans think thought one day attack maraisfontein thought one day hill slaughter dingaan kraal thought morning among bushes

well gave tot stiff one drank quite neat although principles locked bottle afterwards 
also shook old fellow hand thanked seemed please much muttered something effect nothing since died would died therefore thinking 
also two big tears trickled snub nose may produced brandy 
well victors elated may imagined knew slavers escaped would attack us 
first thought food past midday starving 
dinner presupposed cook reminded us sammy

moreover exact center bible bullet hole rather bullet passed stout cover buried paper behind 
remember point reached first book samuel 
sammy seemed quite uninjured indeed poured water never fond water revived quickly enough 
found happened 
gentlemen said seated place refuge told man peace enjoying consolation religion pious times trouble 
length firing slackened ventured peep thinking perhaps foe fled holding book front face case accidents 
remember 
said stephen bullet hit bible bible hit head knocked silly 
ah said sammy true taught book shall shield defense righteous 
understand moved bring thick old bible belonged mother heaven little thin one given sunday school teacher ball enemy would passed 
went cook dinner 
certainly wonderful escape though whether direct reward piety thought another matter 
soon eaten set work consider position crux slaves 
sat groups outside fence many showing traces recent conflict stared us stupidly 
sudden though one voice began clamor food 
feed several hundred people asked stephen 
slavers must done somehow answered 
let go search camp

glad pay shilling fortune told mavovo said stephen back boma bury pots spears used spirit journey answered 
although quite know zulus believe like rest world man lives elsewhere 
chapter viii magic mirror sleep well night danger found long strain told upon nerves 
also many noises 
thus bearers shot handed companions disposed simple fashion namely throwing bush attracted notice hyenas 
four wounded men lay near groaned good deal groaning uttered loud prayers local gods

indeed kind hearted little coward sammy time career served dresser hospital tended wounds none mortal well indeed time time rose minister 
disturbed fearful hubbub came camp 
many tropical african tribes really semi nocturnal habits suppose night cooler day great occasion tendency asserts 
thus every one freed slaves seemed howling loudest accompaniment clashing iron pots stones lacking native drums beat sticks 
moreover lit large fires flitted ominous unpleasant fashion reminded mediaeval pictures hell seen old book 
last could stand longer kicking hans curled like dog slept feet asked going 
answer caused regret question 
plenty slaves cannibal men baas

miscellaneous following length started 
sorrow never saw ivory

great difficulty feed multitude store rice grain upon quite unable keep strict supervision soon devoured 
fortunately country passed time year end wet season full game traveling slowly able shoot great deal 
game killing delightful may sportsman soon palled us business 
say nothing expenditure ammunition meant incessant work 
zulu hunters soon began murmur stephen could rarely leave camp burden fell 
ultimately hit upon scheme 
picking thirty forty likeliest men among slaves served ammunition one arab guns use drilled best could 
told must provide companions meat 
course accidents happened 
one man accidentally shot three others killed cow elephant wounded buffalo

deuce said something like thought matter 
one conditions anything may happen far concerned prevailed life one grows little careless happen

mean believe individual rather identity animates came source life long perhaps hundreds thousands millions years ago career finished perhaps hundreds thousands millions years hence perhaps morrow return perfected still individual dwell source life 
believe also various existences elsewhere fore known fore ordained although sense may shape action free nothing lengthen shorten one single hour 
therefore far concerned always acted great injunction master taken thought morrow 
however instance many others experience morrow took plenty thought 
indeed dawn hans never seemed really sleep dog woke ominous information heard sound thought caused tramp hundreds marching men

slave people including bearers gone every one 
even carried away wounded 
soldiers surrounded us completing circle bolted two ends vanished bush marched previous evening 
often since wondered became 
doubtless perished rest worked way back homes found new ones among tribes 
experiences escaped must interesting still live 
well imagine legends embodied two three generations hence 
deducting slave people bearers wrung hassan party seventeen namely eleven zulu hunters including mavovo two white men hans sammy two mazitus elected remain us round us great circle savages closed slowly 
light grew long coming dull morning mist lifted examined people without seeming take particular notice 
tall much taller average zulu slighter build also lighter color 
like zulus carried large hide shields one broad bladed spear 
throwing assegais seemed wanting place saw armed short bows together quiver arrows slung upon backs 
officers wore short skin cloak kaross men also cloaks found afterwards made inner bark trees 
advanced perfect silence slowly 
nobody said anything orders given must done signs 
could see firearms 
said stephen perhaps shot killed fellows might frightened run away

devil bad temper first words said embodied reproach us asked partake holy drink babemba 
offered make refused saying poison 
babemba set matter rather nervously thought evidently afraid old wizard listened complete silence 
babemba explained without king direct order would foolish unjustifiable put death magicians imbozwi spoke first time asking called us magicians 
babemba instanced wonders shining shield showed pictures 
pooh said imbozwi calm water polished iron show pictures shield make fire said babemba 
white lords say burn man 
let burn replied imbozwi ineffable contempt believe white men magicians worthy kept alive common slave traders often heard 
burn white lords show right exclaimed exasperated babemba fell wrangling 
evidently rivals time lost tempers 
sun hot quite sufficiently enable us give mr imbozwi taste magic determined 
certain whether ordinary mirror would really reflect enough heat scorch drew pocket powerful burning glass sometimes used lighting fires order save matches holding mirror one hand burning glass worked suitable position experiment 
babemba witch doctor arguing fiercely neither seemed notice 
getting focus right directed concentrated spark straight imbozwi greased top knot knew would feel nothing plan char hole

babemba also delighted 
indeed could praise magic enough began make arrangements escort us king head town called beza vowing need fear harm hands soldiers 
fact person appreciate black arts imbozwi 
caught look eye marched told hated us bitterly reflected perhaps foolish use burning glass although truth intended set head fire 
father said mavovo afterwards would better let snake burn death would killed poison 
something doctor tell nothing brotherhood hates much laughed 
made fool people forget macumazana 
chapter ix bausi king midday made start beza town king bausi lived understood ought reach following evening 
hours regiment marched front rather round us complained babemba noise dust confidence quite touching sent ahead 
first however asked us pass word mothers sacred oaths among many african peoples would attempt escape 
confess hesitated giving answer entirely enamoured mazitu prospects among especially discovered jerry discomfited imbozwi departed soldiers business 
matter left indeed tried slip back bush border put months shooting dry season working way southwards 
wish zulu hunters hans need add sammy 
mentioned matter stephen implored abandon idea 
look quatermain said come god forsaken country get great cypripedium get die attempt 
still added surveying rather blank faces right play lives think thing dangerous go alone old boy babemba 
putting everything else aside think one us ought visit bausi kraal case gentleman call brother john turn 
short made mind use talking 
lit pipe quite time contemplated obstinate young man considering matter every point view 
finally came conclusion right wrong 
true bribing babemba otherwise still excellent prospect effecting masterly retreat avoiding many perils 
hand come wild place order retreat 
whose expense come stephen somers wished proceed 
lastly say nothing chance meeting brother john felt obligation since given us slip durban like idea beaten 
started visit mysterious savages worshipped monkey flower might well go till circumstances much us 
dangers everywhere turn back dangers never succeed life imagine 
mavovo said presently pointing stephen pipe inkoosi wazela wish try escape

well put sammy answered waiting inevitable please go cook dinner 
laid aside doubts proceeded journey comfortably enough well provided bearers take place run away 
babemba accompanied single orderly traveled us collected much information 
seemed mazitu large people could muster five seven thousand spears 
tradition came south stock zulus heard vaguely 
indeed many customs say nothing language resembled country 
military organization however thorough ways struck lower race 
one particular true houses advanced saw many kraals passed better built doorways one could walk upright instead kaffir bee holes 
slept one houses march found comfortable innumerable fleas length drove us courtyard 
rest mazitu much resembled zulus 
kraals breeders cattle ruled headmen command supreme chief king believed witchcraft offered sacrifice spirits ancestors also kind vague mighty god dominated affairs world declared doctors 
lastly dare say still race fighting men loved war raided neighbouring peoples upon every pretext killing men stealing women cattle 
virtues kindly hospitable nature though cruel enough enemies 
moreover detested dealing slaves practiced saying better kill man deprive freedom 
also horror cannibalism common dark regions africa reason loathed pongo folk supposed eaters men

think trap catch flies 
still councillors willing visit motombo kalubi hear propose taking risk whatever may happen forbid 
councillors speak altogether one one swift since first speaks shall given honor

moreover sent komba attendants swore harm happened us would rest till found way destroy pongo root branch 
fear answered cold komba holy town rica tie innocent guests stakes shot death arrows 
repartee undoubtedly neat irritated bausi fond allusions subject 
white men safe let take guns asked somewhat illogically 
meant evil king would guns help among many 
instance could steal plotted murder white lords 
law among pongo magic weapon shall allowed enter land 
asked change conversation saw bausi growing wrath feared complications 
lord macumazana prophecy among us gun fired pongo land gods desert us motombo priest die 
saying old little ago none knew meant since spoke hollow spear smoked weapon known us 
indeed said mourning within position bring fulfilment prophecy hans said shaking head sadly great pity great pity three days march country gradually sloped downwards high tableland stood beza town brought us lake called kirua word believe means place island 
lake could see nothing dense brake tall reeds grew shallow water quite mile shore pierced paths made hippopotami came mainland night feed 
high mound looked exactly like tumulus aught know may one however blue waters beyond visible far distance looked glasses appeared tree clad mountain top 
asked komba might answered home gods pongo land 
gods asked whereon replied like black herodotus lawful speak 
rarely met anyone difficult pump frigid un african komba 
top mound planted union jack fixed tallest pole could find

matter fact piece forethought oddly enough originated reckless party stephen proved salvation shall tell later 
foot mound set camp night mazitu soldiers babemba mind mosquitoes making nearer lake opposite wide hippopotamus lane pierced reeds leaving little canal clear water 
asked komba cross lake 
said must start dawn following morning time year wind generally blew shore weather favourable reach pongo town rica nightfall

nodded led four five hundred yards along edge reeds southerly direction 
went two things happened 
first large black rhinoceros sleeping bushes suddenly got wind fashion beasts charged us fifty yards away 
carrying heavy single barrelled rifle yet weapons parted 
came rhinoceros komba small blame spear started run 
cocked rifle waited chance 
fifteen paces away rhinoceros threw head course useless fire horn let drive throat 
bullet hit fair suppose penetrated heart 
rate rolled like shot rabbit single stretch limbs expired almost feet 
komba much impressed 
returned stared dead rhinoceros hole throat stared stared still smoking rifle 
great beast plains killed noise muttered 
killed instant little monkey white man thanked made note magic 
oh motombo wise commanded effort stopped 
well friend matter asked 
see need run 
stepped behind would safe running 
lord macumazana thing strange 
forgive understand 
oh forgive lord kalubi 
clear good deal learn pongo land 
yes lord macumazana perhaps replied dryly time recovered nerve sarcastic powers 
telling mavovo appeared mysteriously sound shot think stalking us case accidents fetch men cut rhinoceros komba proceeded walk 
little edge reeds caught sight narrow oblong trench dug patch stony soil rusted mustard tin half hidden scanty vegetation 
asked seeming astonishment though knew well must 
oh replied komba evidently yet quite white lord dogeetah bausi blood brother set little canvas house twelve moons ago 
really exclaimed never told 
lie somehow afraid lying komba 
know one people fishing reeds saw 
oh explains komba 
odd place fish far home wonder fishing 
time komba must explain catch amidst roots thick reeds shallow water 
komba replied would pleasure time 
though avoid conversation ran forward thrusting reeds apart showed great canoe big enough hold thirty forty men infinite labor hollowed trunk single huge tree 
canoe differed majority personally seen used african lakes rivers fitted mast unshipped 
looked said fine boat whereon komba replied hundred rica town though large 
ah thought walked back camp 
allowing average twenty canoe pongo tribe number two thousand males old enough paddle estimate turned singularly correct 
next morning dawn started difficulty 
begin middle night old babemba came canvas shelter sleeping woke long speech implored go 
said convinced pongo intended foul play sort talk peace mere trick entrap us white men country probably order sacrifice us gods religious reason 
answered quite agreed companions insisted upon making journey could desert 
could beg keep sharp look might able help us case got trouble 
stay watch lord macumazana answered fall snare able swim water like fish fly air like bird free gone one zulu hunters arrived man named ganza sort lieutenant mavovo sang song 
said right go without guns die among devils leave companions wandering alone strange land 
answered much opinion dogeetah insisted upon going choice 
let us kill dogeetah rate tie mischief madness ganza suggested blandly whereon turned 
lastly sammy arrived said mr quatermain plunge deep well foolishness beg consider responsibilities god man especially us household lost sheep far home remember anything disagreeable overtake indebted extent two months wages probably prove unrecoverable 
produced little leather bag tin box counted sammy wages due also three months advance 
astonishment began weep 
sir said seek filthy lucre 
mean afraid killed pongo alas although love sir great coward come killed god made like 
pray go mr quatermain repeat love sir 
believe good fellow answered also afraid killed seem brave must 
however hope shall come right 
meanwhile going give box gold great deal charge sammy trusting anything happens us get safe back durban

morning came last six us marched canoe brought round open waterway 
undergo kind customs house examination hands komba companions seemed terrified lest smuggling firearms

need yellow man take weed land interrupted komba plenty 
cumber stuff stretched hand idly though take hold examine closely 
moment however mavovo called attention bundle undone whether purpose accident know forgetting tobacco komba turned attend 
marvellous celerity hans rolled blanket 
less minute lashings fast hanging back 
suspicion took argument sprung brother john komba former butterfly net komba suspected new kind gun least magical instrument dangerous sort attracted notice 
dispute another arose common garden trowel stephen thought fit bring 
komba asked 
stephen replied brother john dig flowers 
flowers said komba 
one gods flower 
white lord wish dig god course exactly stephen desire unnaturally kept fact 
squabble grew hot finally announced little belongings treated much suspicion might better give journey altogether

lords began rolling eyes like hunted creature terrible pass 
since saw dogeetah visited white god dwells forest mountain yonder scatter sacred seed 
feigned sick komba kalubi passed god went place returned unharmed 
morrow night full moon kalubi must visit god scatter seed dogeetah kill bitten 
certainly kill unless kill 
komba rule kalubi stead kill way guess hot death sacrifice gods women pongo may become mothers many children 
yes yes unless kill god dwells forest must die paused trembling sweat dropped floor 
pleasant said brother john supposing kill god would help us escape motombo murdering people surely would slay us sacrilege 
dogeetah 
god dies motombo dies 
known old therefore motombo watches god mother child 
new god found mother holy flower rules merciful harm none rule certainly put enemies death especially wizard komba 
thought heard faint sound air like hiss snake repeated could see nothing concluded mistaken 
moreover went load gold dust gifts may desire set safe across water among friends mazitu 
look broke let us understand matters clearly john translate stephen 
friend kalubi first god talk lord macumazana huge ape white age born white know 
twice big man stronger twenty men break hands break reed whose heads bite mouth bit finger warning 
treats kalubis wearies 
first bites finger lets go next breaks like reed also breaks doomed sacrifice fire 
ah said great ape thought much 
well long brute god among know long 
beginning 
always motombo always one 
lie way said english went 
mother holy flower also always live place ape god lord macumazana 
dies like mortals succeeded one takes place 
thus present mother white woman race middle age 
dies succeeded daughter also white woman beautiful 
dies another white found perhaps one black parents born white 
old daughter interrupted brother john curiously intent voice father daughter born twenty years ago dogeetah mother flower captured brought 
says father white man married dead 
brother john head dropped upon chest eyes shut though gone sleep 
mother lives went kalubi island lake top mountain surrounded water 
nothing white god women serve go across lake times tend fields grows seed kalubi sows corn white god food 
good said understand much little 
tell us next plan come place great ape lives come kill beast seeing successor komba careful prevent us bringing firearms land aye lord macumazana may teeth god meet brain trick yes may die know make die 
prophecy told prophecy old 
arose land within last moon though whether came komba motombo know 
none save least heard iron tubes throw death prophecy concerning sure know kalubi answer rest question 
coming forest white god lives forest slopes mountain lords easy since motombo people believe trapping sacrifice desire sundry reasons looked plump stephen suggestive way 
kill god without tubes iron know 
brave great magicians 
surely find way 
brother john seemed wake 
yes said shall find way 
fear kalubi 
afraid big ape call god 
yet must price 
kill beast try save life save price 
price asked kalubi nervously 
wives cattle want wives cattle taken across lake 
gold dust ivory 
already promised nothing give 
price kalubi hand us taken away white woman called mother holy flower daughter interrupted stephen interpreting holy flower dug roots 
heard modest requests poor kalubi became like one upon verge madness 
understand gasped understand asking gods country quite replied brother john calmness gods country nothing less 
kalubi made though would fly hut caught arm said see friend things thus 
ask us great danger kill one gods country highest order save life 
well payment ask make present remaining gods country see us safe across lake 
accept refuse refuse answered kalubi sullenly 
accept would mean last curse upon spirit horrible tell 
refuse means first curse upon body namely hours must broken chewed great monkey call god 
yes broken chewed afterwards think cooked eaten sacrifice 
kalubi nodded head groaned 
yet went part glad refused since shall rid troublesome dangerous business return safety mazitu land 
return safety lord macumazana doomed hot death escape fangs god easily kalubi telling komba kalubi plots god refused listen wickedness 
fact think may done us kalubi perhaps expect found 
go strike upon pot without door doubtless though late hear 
nay man stand still knives servants spears made though pass 
lord said give mother holy flower daughter aye holy flower dug roots swear set safe across lake asking may come since dare stay 
yet curse come better die curse day morrow fangs god 
oh born born began weep 
question many asked none able answer friend kalubi though mayhap answer somewhere replied kind voice 
heart stirred pity poor wretch mazed lost hell superstition potentate could escape trappings hateful power save door death horrible contemplate priest whose doom slain hands god went slain came would slain 
yet went think chosen wisely hold word 
faithful us say nothing 
sure attempt betray us helpless seem betray shall die us 
bargain bargain white lord although blame things go wrong since gods know devils delight human woe mock bargains torment would injure 
yet come swear keep faith thus oath may broken drawing knife girdle thrust tip tongue pricked 
puncture drop blood fell floor 
break oath said may flesh grow cold blood grows cold may rot blood rots aye may spirit waste lost world ghosts blood wastes air lost dust world horrible scene one impressed much especially even fell upon conviction unfortunate man doomed fate could escape upon 
said nothing another moment thrown white wrappings face slipped door 
afraid playing rather low jumpy old boy said stephen remorsefully 
white woman white woman daughter muttered brother john 
yes reflected stephen aloud 
one justified anything get two white women hell exist 
one may well orchid also lonely without poor things glad thought soothing conscience 
hope find iron grid noticed wide enough three remarked sarcastically 
quiet want go sleep 
sorry add night want remained master 
sleep could rather obliged think thought hard indeed 
first reflected pongo gods 
worship soon gave remembering problem one applied equally dozens dark religions vast african continent none could give answer least votaries 
answer indeed must sought horrible fears unenlightened human heart sees death terror evil around everywhere grotesque form personifies gods rather devils must propitiated 
always fetish beast whatever may real object worship 
thing creature inhabited spirit god devil temple furnishes home temple therefore holy 
spirits diverse representing sundry attributes qualities 
thus great ape might satan prince evil blood 
holy flower might symbolise fertility growth food man bosom earth 
mother flower might represent mercy goodness reason necessary white color dwell shadowed forest soaring mountain figure light short opposed darkness 
might kind african ceres goddess corn harvest symbolised beauteous bloom tended 
could tell either afterwards never found 
pongo case obvious 
dying tribe last descendants higher race grown barren intermarriage 
probably first cannibals occasionally religious reasons 
time dearth became religious respect habit overpowered 
among cannibals rate africa knew dreadful food much preferred meat 
slightest doubt although kalubi brought us wild hope might save terrible death hands beelzebub served komba councillors inspired thereto prophet called motombo designed murdered eaten offering gods 
escape fate unarmed could imagine unless special protection vouchsafed us 
meanwhile must go end whatever might 
brother john give right name reverend john eversley convinced white woman imprisoned mountain none lost wife searched twenty weary years second white woman heard night strange might seem daughter 
perhaps right perhaps wrong 
even latter case two white persons really languishing dreadful land path clear 
must go faith saved died 
life granted pleasure round even love sweet dream lapse content duty faith words solemn sound echoes must soul bent one wrote nobly think 
well little pleasure round present entertainment hope love sweet dream seemed limited brother john quite mistaken often 
probably echoes would share indeed already seemed hear ominous thunder 
last go sleep dreamed curious dream 
seemed disembodied although retained powers thought observation fact dead yet alive 
state hovered people pongo gathered together great plain inky sky 
going business usual unpleasant business often 
worshipping dim form knew devil committing murders feasting feasted would look laboring engaged barter thinking 
power looking saw within breast tiny likeness man woman child might humbly bent upon knees hands together attitude prayer imploring tear stained face looking upwards black heaven 
heaven appeared single star light star flowed lines gentle fire spread widened till immense arc one flame glory 
pulsing heart glory somehow reminded moving lips fell countless flakes snow followed appointed path till lit upon forehead one tiny imploring figures hidden within savage breasts made white clean 
glory shrank faded till remained similitude two transparent hands stretched though blessing woke wondering earth found fancy invent vision whether meant anything nothing 
afterwards repeated brother john spiritually minded well good man two things often quite different asked kind enough explain 
time shook head days later said think read riddle allan answer came quite sudden 
sin stained hearts seed good aspiration towards right 
every one also last mercy forgiveness since could learn never teacher dream allan one ultimate redemption even evil mankind gift grace shall one day glow blackness night wander 
said hope right since present something wrong world especially africa 
also blame blind savage many things balance much better considering lights opportunities oh truth devil convenient word good fisherman 
large book full flies different sizes colors well knows suit particular fish 
white black every fish takes one fly comes question fish swallowed big gaudy lure much worse foolish fallen delicate white moth sharp barb tail short miserable sinners prayer book says eye judge average elemental differences waters wherein bred called upon swim much choose us need outstretched hands mercy saw dream right poor old hunter discuss things high chapter xv motombo dream went sleep till finally aroused strong ray light hitting straight eye 
dickens come thought huts windows 
followed ray source perceived small hole mud wall five feet floor

reflected anyone wanted eavesdrop aperture would convenient went outside hut pursue investigations 
wall found situated four feet eastern part encircling reed fence showed signs disturbance although outer face wall hole beneath lime flooring lay broken fragments plaster 
called hans asked kept watch round hut wrapped man visited us night 
answered yes could swear one come near since several times walked back looked 
somewhat comforted though satisfied went wake others said nothing matter since seemed foolish alarm good purpose 
minutes later tall silent women arrived hot water 
seemed curious hot water brought us place queer kind housemaids 
pongo may add like zulus clean persons though whether used hot water say

five minutes walk along wide main street led us northern gate rica town 
found kalubi escort thirty men armed spears noted unlike mazitu bows arrows 
announced loud voice proposed us special honor conducting us sanctuary holy one understood mean motombo 
politely begged trouble irritable mood assuming told us rudely mind business 
indeed think irritability real enough circumstances known reader strange 
rate hour later declared act great cruelty showed us absolute man power temporal matters 
passing little clump bush came gardens surrounded light fence number cattle small delicate breed unlike jerseys appearance broken enjoy devouring crops 
garden appeared belonged kalubi time furious destruction produce cattle also belonged 
herd shouted 
hunt began presently poor fellow lad discovered asleep behind bush 
dragged kalubi pointed first cattle broken fence devastated garden 
lad began mutter excuses pray mercy 
kill said kalubi whereon herd flung ground clutching ankles began kiss feet crying afraid die 
kalubi tried kick free failing lifted big spear made end poor boy prayers life single stroke 
escort clapped hands salute approval four sign took body started trot rica town probably night appeared upon grid 
brother john saw big white beard bristled indignation like hair back angry cat stephen spluttered something beginning brute lifted fist though knock kalubi 
caught hold doubt would done 
kalubi gasped brother john know blood calls blood hour death remember death 
would bewitch white man said kalubi glaring angrily 
lifted spear john never stirred held poised irresolutely 
komba thrust crying back dogeetah dare meddle customs kalubi lord life death brother john answer called english heaven sake silent unless want follow boy

fully minute furious bellowings echoed great cave pongo soldiers rising recumbent position pointed hands torches still burned miserable kalubi wrath seemed concentrated rather us hissed like snakes 
really might scene hell motombo playing part satan 
indeed swollen diabolical figure supported thin toad like legs great fires burning either side lurid lights evening reflected still water beyond glowering among tree tops mountain white robed forms tall pongo bending every one towards wretched culprit hissing like many fierce serpents suggested uttermost deep infernal regions one might conceive nightmare 
went time know long till length motombo picked fantastically shaped horn blew

outside graveyard clearing lay true huge fallen boughs 
big us move cut 
moreover soaked damp like everything forest would impossible fire 
darkness closed 
absolute blackness presently moon rose sky rainy obscured moreover huge trees seemed suck whatever light 
crouched upon ground back back near possible center place unrolled blankets protect us damp cold ate biltong dried game flesh parched corn fortunately boy jerry carried bagful remained upon shoulders thrown canoe 
luckily thought bringing food us also flask spirits 
first thing happened 
far away forest resounded awful roar followed drumming noise roar none us ever heard quite unlike lion beast 
asked 
god groaned kalubi god praying moon always rises 
said nothing reflecting four shots many nothing tempt waste one 
oh hans put rotten old waistcoat instead new one gave durban since heard roars brother john began question kalubi mother flower lived 
lord answered man distracted way towards east 
walk quarter sun journey hill following path marked notches cut upon trees till beyond garden god top mountain water found surrounding island 
banks water canoe hidden bushes water may crossed island dwells mother holy flower 
brother john seem quite satisfied information remarked kalubi would able show us road morrow 
think shall ever show road groaned shivering wretch 
moment god roared much nearer 
kalubi nerve gave altogether quickened presentiment began question brother john learned priest unknown sort possibility another life death 
brother john remembered earnest missionary calling proceeded administer compressed religious consolations quite near us god began beat upon kind large deep drum 
roar time worked away massed band military drum 
least sounded like unpleasant hear awful forest skulls arranged boxes round us assure reader 
drumming ceased pulling together brother john continued pious demonstrations 
also time thick rain cloud quite obscured moon darkness grew dense 
heard john explaining kalubi really kalubi immortal soul wonder whether understood 
became aware horrible shadow describe way blacker blackness advanced towards us extraordinary speed edge clearing 
next second kind scuffle feet followed stifled yell saw shadow retreating direction come 
matter asked 
strike match answered brother john think something happened 
struck match burnt well air quite still 
light saw first anxious faces party ghastly looked next kalubi risen waving right arm air right arm bloody lacked hand 
god visited taken away hand moaned wailing voice 
think anybody spoke thing beyond words tried bind poor fellow arm light matches 
sat watched 
darkness grew still denser thick cloud passed moon silence utter silence tropical forest night broken sound breathing buzz mosquitoes distant splash plunging crocodile stifled groans mutilated man 
saw thought saw may half hour later black shadow dart towards us pike darts fish pond 
another scuffle left hans sat kalubi followed single prolonged wail 
king man gone whispered hans 
felt go though wind blown away 
nothing hole 
sudden moon shone behind clouds 
sickly light half way us edge clearing say thirty yards saw oh see devil destroying lost soul 
least looked like 
huge gray black creature grotesquely human shape thin kalubi grip 
kalubi head vanished maw vast black arms seemed employed breaking pieces 
apparently already dead though feet lifted ground still moved feebly 
sprang covered beast rifle cocked getting full head showed clearest though rather guesswork since could see distinctly fore sight 
pulled either cap powder got little damp journey hung fire fraction second 
infinitesimal time devil best name give thing saw perhaps saw light gleaming barrel 
rate dropped kalubi though intelligence warned expect threw massive right arm remember extraordinarily long limb seemed looked thick man thigh fashion cover head 
rifle exploded heard bullet strike 
light flash saw great arm tumble dead helpless kind way next instant whole forest began echo peal upon peal awful roarings described ended dog like yowp pain 
hit baas said hans ghost like 
still lively 
close answered hold spears reload 
fear brute would rush us 

dreadful night saw heard 
indeed began hope bullet reached mortal part great ape dead 
length seemed weeks afterwards dawn broke revealed us sitting white shivering gray mist except stephen gone comfortably sleep head resting mavovo shoulder 
man equably minded devoid nerves feel sure one last disturbed trump archangel 
least told indignantly length roused indecent slumbers 
judge things results allan said yawn 
fresh pippin look though ball twelve extras 
retrieved kalubi yet shortly afterwards mist lifted little went line retrieve kalubi found well describe found 
cruel wretch incident herd boy told us felt sorry 
still terrors least hope 
deposited box komba kindly provided preparation inevitable event brother john said prayer miscellaneous remains 
consultation worst spirits set seek way home mother flower 
start easy enough distinct though faint path led clearing slope hill 
afterwards became difficult denser forest began 
fortunately creepers grew forest flat tops huge trees meeting high entirely shut sky gloom great places almost night 
oh melancholy journey filled fears stole pallid throng trunk trunk searching notches indicated road speaking whispers lest sound voices attract notice dreadful god 
mile two became aware notice attracted despite precautions times caught glimpses huge gray thing slipping along parallel us boles trees 
hans wanted try shot would knowing chances hitting small indeed 
three charges rather three caps left necessary saving 
halted held consultation result decided danger going standing still attempting return 
went keeping close together 
one rifle accorded appreciate honor heading procession 
another half mile heard strange rolling sound produced believe great brute beating upon breast noted continuous previous night 
ha said hans strike drum one stick 
bullet broke baas 
little farther god roared quite close loudly air seemed tremble 
drum right whatever may happened sticks said 
hundred yards catastrophe occurred

saw enormous gray shape top trunk saw pass like flash running upright man head held forward noted arm nearest swinging though broken 
turned heard scream terror perceived gripped poor mazitu jerry walked last one line ended mavovo 
yes gripped carrying clasped breast sound arm 
say jerry although full grown man rather inclined stoutness looked like child fell embrace give idea creature size 
mavovo courage buffalo charged drove copper spear carried side 
charged like berserkers except even thank heaven knew trick worth two 
three seconds struggling mass center clearing 
brother john stephen mavovo hans stabbing enormous gorilla gorilla although blows seemed harm pinpricks 
fortunately part beast would let go jerry one sound arm could snap assailants lifted foot rend top heavy bulk would caused tumble

instant clear steadying aimed huge head let drive 
smoke thinned saw gigantic ape standing quite still like creature lost meditation 
threw sound arm turned fierce eyes sky uttering one pitiful hideous howl sank dead 
bullet entered behind ear buried brain 
great silence forest flowed us quite one said anything 
somewhere amidst mosses heard thin voice sound reminded air squeezed indiarubber cushion 
good shot baas piped good killed king vulture dingaan kraal difficult 
baas could pull god say thank 
thank almost inaudible wonder poor hans fainted 
lay huge bulk gorilla nose mouth appearing brute body arm

leaving brother john examine hans see really injured bethought poor jerry went look 
one glance enough 
quite dead

brother john told afterwards arms nearly ribs broken terrible embrace 
even spine dislocated 
often wondered gorilla ran line without touching others vent rage upon jerry 
suggest unlucky mazitu sat next kalubi previous night may caused brute identify smell priest learned hate killed 
true hans sat side kalubi perhaps odour pongo clung much perhaps meant deal done jerry

course impossible say one might easily imagined creature two hundred years old motombo declared 
stephen suggested skinned although saw little prospect able carry away hide assented helped operation mere chance saving great curiosity 
also although brother john restless murmured something wasting time thought necessary rest fearful anxieties still fearful encounter consecrated monster 
set work result hour toil dragged hide tough thick found copper spears scarcely penetrated flesh 
bullet put previous night struck discovered upon bone upper arm shattered sufficiently render limb useless break altogether 
indeed fortunate us creature retained arms uninjured would certainly killed us attack 
saved fact hugging jerry limb left could strike luckily succeed attempts get hold tremendous jaws nipped kalubi hand easily pair scissors severs stalk flower

never would kalubis pongo land shiver lives feet dreadful divinity soon late must become executioner believe exception two committed suicide fear kalubi ever known died except hand teeth god 
would give know brute history could possibly motombo said accompanied pongo people home western central africa perhaps brought state captivity unable answer question noted none mazitu natives ever heard existence true gorillas part africa 
creature origin locality must either solitary habits driven away fellows sometimes happens old elephants like gorilla become fearfully ferocious
