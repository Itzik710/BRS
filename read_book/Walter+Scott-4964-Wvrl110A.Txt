every step knew would rigorously canvassed business place justice integrity conduct beyond limits question 
waverley retired laird clergyman cairnvreckan sat silence evening meal 
servants attendance neither chose say anything circumstances occupied minds neither felt easy speak upon 
youth apparent frankness waverley stood strong contrast shades suspicion darkened around sort naivete openness demeanor seemed belong one unhackneyed ways intrigue pleaded highly favor 
mused particulars examination viewed medium feelings 
men ready acute talent equally competent combine various parts evidence deduce necessary conclusions 
wide difference habits education often occasioned great discrepancy respective deductions admitted premises 
major melville versed camps cities vigilant profession cautious experience met much evil world therefore though upright magistrate honorable man opinions others always strict sometimes unjustly severe 
mr morton contrary passed literary pursuits college beloved companions respected teachers ease simplicity present charge opportunities witnessing evil never dwelt upon order encourage repentance amendment love respect parishioners repaid affectionate zeal behalf endeavoring disguise knew would give acute pain namely occasional transgressions duties business life recommend 
thus common saying neighborhood though popular characters laird knew ill parish minister good

really devise better mode securing fancy would hardly advise encounter responsibility setting liberty 
objection seeing tomorrow private said minister 
none certainly loyalty character warrant

friends parted retired rest filled anxious reflections state country 
chapter xxxiii confidant waverley awoke morning troubled dreams unrefreshing slumbers full consciousness horrors situation 
might terminate knew 
might delivered military law midst civil war likely scrupulous choice victims quality evidence 
feel much comfortable thoughts trial scottish court justice knew laws forms differed many respects england taught believe however erroneously liberty rights subject less carefully protected

said like men honor take earliest opportunity welcome britain descendant ancient kings lineal heir throne unthread rude eye rebellion welcome home discarded faith seek prince charles fall feet recorded excellence worth house waverley founded upon loyal faith house stuart

netted toils disposal suspicious stern cold hearted man perhaps turned solitude dungeon infamy public execution 
fergus true prophecy proved speedy speedy accomplishment edward ruminating painful subjects contemplation naturally though quite justly bestowing upon reigning dynasty blame due chance part least unreflecting conduct mr morton availed major melville permission pay early visit 
waverley first impulse intimate desire might disturbed questions conversation suppressed upon observing benevolent reverend appearance clergyman rescued immediate violence villagers 
believe sir said unfortunate young man circumstances much gratitude express safety life may worth present tumult mind anticipation yet likely endure hardly offer thanks interposition 
mr morton replied far making claim upon good opinion wish sole purpose visit find means deserving 
excellent friend major melville continued feelings duties soldier public functionary fettered always coincide opinions forms perhaps little allowance imperfections human nature 
paused proceeded intrude confidence mr waverley purpose learning circumstances knowledge prejudicial either others earnest wish would intrust particulars could lead exculpation 
solemnly assure deposited faithful extent limited powers zealous agent 
sir presume presbyterian clergyman mr morton bowed 
guided prepossessions education might distrust friendly professions case observed similar prejudices nourished country professional brethren episcopal persuasion willing believe equally unfounded cases 
evil thinks otherwise said mr morton holds church government ceremonies exclusive gage christian faith moral virtue 
continued waverley perceive trouble detail particulars revolving carefully possible recollection find unable explain much charged 
know indeed innocent hardly see hope prove 
reason mr waverley said clergyman venture solicit confidence 
knowledge individuals country pretty general upon occasion extended

waverley minutes reflection convinced reposing confidence mr morton far concerned could hurt neither mr bradwardine fergus mac ivor openly assumed arms government might possibly professions new friend corresponded sincerity earnestness expression service 
therefore ran briefly events reader already acquainted suppressing attachment flora indeed neither mentioning rose bradwardine course narrative
