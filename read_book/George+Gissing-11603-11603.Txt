vain however listen word either gentlemen might confirm belief conversation name title used mention made anything significant 
remained hour 
horses brought round considerable crowd gathered hotel visitors departed amid demonstration exuberant loyalty 
following day one two persons present scene declared two gentlemen showed surprise though raised hats acknowledgment attention received rode away laughing

day knew peace 
fired extraordinary arrogance viewed enemy every one refused believe prince visit quarrelled violently many best friends brought insulting accusations manner persons 
long man honestly convinced existed conspiracy rob distinction due 
political animus perhaps something liberal newspaper mr fouracres stout conservative made one malicious joke subject 
townsmen stood landlord side used ingenuity discovering plausible reasons prince care publicly proclaimed visited town lunched hotel 
partisans scorned suggestion mr fouracres made mistake unable deny letter addressed prince view putting end debate elicited secretarial hand brief denial landlord story 
evidently something mysterious underlay whole affair much shaking heads long time 
mr fouracres result honor strenuously vindicated serious indeed

whereupon mr fouracres purchase land begin build hotel twice large must shortly quit
