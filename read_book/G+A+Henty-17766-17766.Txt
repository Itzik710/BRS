men every one old hunters indian fighters match redskin every move forest war 
true grit backbone rough outspoken men service foot carelessly placed dried twig word spoken whisper may bring crowd yelping redskins upon us cost every man scalp would speak sharply king scout must take offence rough word may said 
james laughed said care much blown thankfully receive lessons masters forest craft

james took seat middle boat 
jonathan behind 
nat handled paddle bow 
brief delay starting ten boats darted noiselessly lake

canoe birch bark thin seemed incautious movement would instantly knock hole 
weigh steadier expected james could feel bound forward stroke paddles 
became accustomed motion boat raised sitting position bottom kneeling others began dip paddle quietly water time stroke 
familiarity rowing rendered easy keep time swing ere long found putting considerable amount force stroke 
nat looked back shoulder 
well done young un

falling dusk boat started time quite dark 
scarce word heard ten canoes keeping near right hand shore lake glided rapidly along close body 
noiselessly paddles dipped water drip lifted sound heard 
four hours steady paddling took narrows five twenty miles starting point

yes see james said easy enough make next tree next far see others seem difference roots one side 
scout replied 
see younger trees like enough grow circumstances

night fallen party launch canoes lake 
paddled several hours james imagined traversed greater distance miles made previous evening 
knew learned day land six miles point lake george joins lake champlain opposite side promontory stretching lake french constructing new fort 
canoes carried seven eight miles wood across neck land two lakes launched lake champlain following east shore lake would pass ticonderoga safe distance 
halt made noiselessly hauled canoes men slept till daybreak lifting light craft shoulders started journey woods 
toilsome work ground rough broken often thickly covered underwood 
ridges crossed deep ravines passed although canoes heavy greatest care exercised graze projecting bough edge rock would suffice tear hole thin bark 
late afternoon arrived shores lake champlain 
fire lighted greatest care taken select perfectly dry sticks iroquois likely scattered far wide among woods 
risk however far less sight french side lake george 
darkness fell canoes placed water striking across lake followed right hand shore 
paddling hour half work suddenly ceased 
lake seemed widen left passed tongue land two lakes opposite shore number fires seen burning brightly hillside 
ticonderoga abreast advanced post french 
lingered time paddles dipped water counting fires making careful note position 
paddled twelve miles beyond fort crossed lake landed french shore 
canoes approach shore together done previous nights 
halted half mile captain rogers went forward another canoe landed half hour signal given imitation croaking frog careful search ascertained forest untenanted landing safe 
sooner signal given canoes set motion soon safely hauled shore 
five men went usual scouts rest fatigued paddle hard day work soon asleep 
morning start rogers ordered canoes hauled hidden among bushes done work would present abandoned recovered made useful future occasion 
men charged work gave sudden exclamation reached canoes 
rogers said angrily 
want bring redskins forest upon us canoes damaged one scouts said coming 
general movement canoes lying bank yards distance water edge 
every one rendered useless 
thin birch bark gashed slit pieces cut one escaped injury fit take water 
beyond low words exclamations dismay word spoken band gathered round canoes 
watch side rogers asked 
nat jonathan took first half night one scouts said 
williams relieved 
four men greatest skill experience rogers felt sure neglect carelessness part could led disaster 
see passing boats hear sound lake four men guard replied negative 
swear one landed near canoes nat said 
glimmer water night canoe could possibly come near bank anywheres without seeing 
must come land side rogers said 
skulking indian must seen us lake hidden landed 
may tree overhead time directly canoes hauled may damaged made 
time lost lads 
five hours since landed 
started redskins may round us 
question scouting round french fort one saving scalps 
could done james walsham asked nat low tone 
sleeping within yards canoes men close 
thought must heard 
heard hunter said contemptuously redskin would make noise cutting holes gashes would cutting hunk deer flesh dinner 
would lie ground wriggle one another like eel reckon begin till camp still 
canoes hauled till sarched woods thought moving close till lay 
standing theer water edge six feet away canoe 
never moved two hours quiet redskin may must taken time damage never heard sound loud falling leaf 
reckon least two hours job 
may gone four hours bit give us much start 
would take hour half get fort would report french chap command might talk set redskins leaving french follow 
use thinking mending canoes suppose james asked 
hunter shook head 
would take two three hours get fresh bark mend holes said got many minutes spare 

speaking rogers holding consultation two three experienced followers arrived pretty nearly conclusion rogers namely indian probably taken two three hours damaging canoes getting fairly away forest even done iroquois would course half hour 
let man pack share meat back rogers said 
leave scrap behind 
quick lads minute lost 
case legs 
hiding trail thirty men redskin eyes 
couple minutes ready start rogers led way long slinging trot straight back lake first saying pick way lads tread fallen stick 
one chance saving scalps one depends upon silence 
james ran along heels nat struck strangeness scene noiselessness band moccasin footed men flitted among trees 
word spoken 
implicit confidence leader experienced bush fighter frontier knew anyone could lead safe perils surrounded rogers 
james wondered plan could 
seemed certain indians must sooner later overtake 
would aware strength band confiding superior numbers would able push forward pursuit without pausing many precautions 
overtaken band must stand bay even could hold indians check sound firing would soon bring french soldiers spot 
gone twenty minutes distant war whoop rose forest behind 
come camp nat said glancing round shoulder find left 
expect hung little ventured knowing expecting found canoes useless 
war whoop tells em gone 
gather us like pack hounds 
ah thought captain 
rogers turned sharp left direction ticonderoga stood 
slacked speed somewhat perspiration streaming faces even trained hardy followers 
time time looked round see keeping well together 
although emergency none thought questioning judgment leader many wondering unusual speed leading along 
two miles start pursuers evening hand would understood importance keeping ahead darkness came cover trail whole day felt must overtaken sooner later could see object exhausting strength struggle began 
ran somewhat slower pace idea leader intention dawned upon scouts saw direction taking would strike lake shore near french fort 
nat light wiry running easily many comrades panting exertions side james walsham 
give rifle lad bit 
new work weight gun takes 
got another nine ten miles us yet 
hold bit james replied 
getting wind better ten miles must seventy away fort 
never get nat said 
us might redskins would us hour two 
thought started captain would told us scatter give us chance getting see plan one gives us real chance 
making straight french fort 
reckons doubt best part french troops marched redskins 
would surely enough left james said hold fort us even could take could hold hour came 
thinking fort boy thinking boats 
know lots em get minutes redskins overtake us may get safe 
chance think good one 
others caught leader idea repeated comrades animating effect soon showed increased speed party hurried forest 
almost every man thought case hopeless deemed continue flight overtaken redskins must sooner later succumb rifles iroquois french allies 
prospect hour run means escape might found animated man renewed efforts 
running distance longer rogers suddenly halted held hand band simultaneously came halt 
first nothing could heard save quick breathing confused noise heard left front deep trampling sound voices occasional clash arms 
french column coming nat whispered rogers swerving somewhat right making sign run silently possible continued course 
chapter commission 
presently noise made column french troops heard abreast fugitives 
died away behind directed course left 
ten minutes later heard loud succession indian whoops knew redskins pursuing also heard french column march would warning course band taking 
scouts four miles ticonderoga man knew mere question speed 
throw away meat rogers ordered want every pound tells 
men already got rid blankets burdened rifles ammunition 
ground rough broken nearing steep promontory french fort erected 
still mile ahead pursuers although latter gained distance upon since first start scouts knew exerting utmost redskins could gaining little upon trained white man point speed endurance fairly match average indian 
descended within short distance edge lake order avoid valleys ravines running hills 
war whoops rose frequently forest behind indians yelling give fort notice chase approaching

great exertions scouts making could tell sound war whoops least indians gaining upon 
accustomed every man party fatigues forest strain telling upon 
twelve miles run almost top speed short panting breath set faces reeling steps showed nearly end powers

white coated troops perceiving scouts intention pouring intrenchments 
couple minutes sufficed men launch boats take seats oars dipped water three four indians dashed edge forest

stretch oars lads get range soon 
indians began fire soon perceived boats 
scarcely two hundred yards away like white men panting fatigue bullets flew harmlessly

wait till hands get steady fire french 
many redskins yet

french launching bateaux got fair start overtake us reach opposite point 
fresher soldiers good rowing besides sure crowd boats chance 
five six boats crowded men started pursuit fully half mile behind two english boats reached shore

soon french boats came within range steady fire opened upon 
confusion apparent among

capital fellow much liked regiment 
colonel otway received james great cordiality 
glad get us mr walsham said consider credit regiment young officer three times mentioned despatches 
great service us able give us good many hints indian method fighting braddock men found terrible 
formidable sir accustomed unfortunately general braddock forced men fight regular fashion stand shot mode fighting woods fatal 
hundred redskins would match forest ten times number white troops persisted fighting ridiculous way fighting way white men match redskins 
indeed frontiersmen thrash indians even two three one 
last affair lake mr walsham heard johnson 
yes sir beginning nearly repetition braddock disaster surprised first beaten column went made stout fight gave us time put camp state defense 
indians made rush think would carried contented keeping distant fire provincials young troops quite unaccustomed fighting wholly without drill discipline gradually got steady length sallied beat decisively

mr edwards take mess introduce brother officers 
james well received officers regiment soon found perfectly home 
devote hours every day acquiring mysteries drill 
somewhat funny see pains expended assuring movement performed mechanical accuracy understood although useless warfare great accuracy details necessary ensuring uniformity movement among large masses men open country 
otherwise time passed pleasantly 
james soon became favorite regiment young officers never tired questioning concerning redskins manner fighting 
plenty amusements 
snow deep ground officers skated practiced snowshoes drove sleighs 
occasionally got dance people albany settlers round vied hospitality officers 
one day february orderly brought message james walsham colonel wished speak 
walsham said may tell privately regiment likely form part expedition fitted england louisbourg cape breton key canada 
considerable number troops province accompany 
leave frontier altogether open enemy james said surprise 
opinion walsham 
louisbourg altogether outside range present struggle seems british force employed striking vital point 
however purpose 
earl loudon plan 
however manifest say frontier left terribly open therefore two companies regiments going left 
naturally officer regiment experience forest warfare would one left ensign would much influence think would useful service pleasant obtain something like roving commission 
think greatly prefer sir james said gratefully 
general little vexed know colonel went numerous successes daring feats gained rogers leaders companies scouts regulars opportunity fire shot think would accept proposal make company called royal scouts formed volunteers taken various regiments command 
thank sir james said like things fear chance whatever rivalling work rogers partisan leaders 
men trained work woods accustomed fight indians equally home canoe forest 
good enough say experience work mere child side lead fifty english soldiers forest fear none us would ever return 
yes propose engage enterprises sort walsham 
idea although would independent command considerable freedom action would act connection regular troops 
scouts often far away wanted leaving posts open surprise 
impatient discipline adverse going near forts except obtain fresh supplies 
contrary would act eyes post might think threatened enemy 
present instance fort william henry exposed attack 
would take command would report major eyre command 
service letter appointment would state authorized act independently would duty obey orders commanding officer authorized offer suggestions experience indian warfare would lead make 
would train men scouts 
would special duty guard fort surprise course case attack take part defense 
event provincial scouts making concerted movement french post would authorized join 
would benefit skill experience case success army would get share credit 
think plan like things james replied 
would precisely duty select choice 
thought colonel said 
formed high opinion judgment discretion talks together spoken strongly favor general promised event army moving forward appointment quartermaster general staff intelligence officer 
since heard main portion army sail louisbourg thinking plan certainly seems corps suggested would great service 
think strength fifty men 
course another officer 
anyone would like choose may well take whole scheme cut dried general like mr edwards sir 
junior regiment active zealous service greatly like allowed enlist temporarily two scouts served force power take discharge wished 
would immense utility instructing men new duties would add greatly efficiency 
colonel said

major eyre james reported showed appointment defining authority duties expressed much satisfaction arrival reinforcement 
rumors brought scouts said strong force ere long come crown point ticonderoga shall attacked 
lake frozen regular troops could march without difficulty force inadequate considering strength french attack 
none officers men experience indian methods attack experience valuable 
pity give one companies scouts permanently

everything needful comfort provided overcoats blankets bear skins sleep tarpaulins cover 
provided twelve days provisions placed hand sledges drawn troops 
marched ice lake champlain ticonderoga rested week constructed three hundred scaling ladders 
three days march lake george brought english fort 
weak point expedition leader vaudreuil canadian greatest jealousy french officers intrusted command expedition brother rigaud 
fire damage garrison lay sheltered behind entrenchments replying occasionally whenever enemy mustered force intention attacking

midnight called 
sound lake 
cannon opened silent 
look walsham look edwards exclaimed

scouts followed ran shore indians done work well 
two sloops many boats well alight evident long hole could broken ice buckets brought fort would beyond hopes saving 
french opened fire woods bordering lake light flames exposed men enemy marksmen james called back fort sloops boats burned

looks james replied wanted make full show force 
see white flag party coming forward 
officer several men advanced towards fort major eyre sent one officers equal number men meet 
short parley parties came together french officer advanced towards fort english followers remaining ice 
nearing fort french officer le mercier chief canadian artillery blindfolded led room major eyre british officers awaiting 
handkerchief removed eyes announced commandant bearer message officer commanding french force desirous avoiding effusion blood begged english commander abstain resistance force superior could useless 
offered favourable terms would surrender place peaceably said driven make assault indian allies would unquestionably massacre whole garrison 
major eyre quietly replied intended defend utmost 
envoy blindfolded 
rejoined french force latter advanced attack place soon halted leaving ice opened fusillade border woods kept hours garrison contemptuously abstaining reply 
night french heard advancing sound coming sides 
garrison stood arms believing time real attack made 
nearer nearer came sound garrison could see nothing pitchy darkness fired wherever could hear sound 
presently bright light burst 
redskins provided faggots resinous sticks crept towards buildings consisting several store houses hospital saw mill huts tents rangers placed torches set fire instantly retreated 
garrison could nothing save buildings efforts absence water must unavailing would shot foe lying beyond circle light 
therefore remained lying behind entrenchment firing wherever heard slightest sound momentarily expecting attack morning came without french advancing garrison able give whole attention saving buildings fort 
great wood stacks ignited burning embers fell thickly huts hours greatest exertions troops able save buildings destruction 
every moment expected attacked french advanced huts must left case garrison would found shelterless provisions stores would consumed noon danger fires begun burn low heavy snow storm set 
day continued 
would time attack james walsham said lieutenant 
scarce see twenty yards away 
chance edwards agreed believe attacking 
think got command 
ought shot man force hanging four days could carried place rush moment 
think attack james replied 
men stop light fire warm within sight enemy fort want surprise likely venture shelter blankets snow 
day night snow came till ground covered depth three feet 
early tuesday morning twenty volunteers french regulars made bold attempt burn sloop building stocks several storehouses structures near water hundreds boats canoes ranged near 
succeeded firing sloop buildings james scouts sallied forced retreat loss five number pulling huts prevented fire spreading 
next morning sun rose brightly white sheet lake dotted french full retreat canada 
total loss eleven killed wounded english side seven men wounded slightly 
never worse conducted futile expedition 
affair time passed slowly fort william henry 
sun gained strength enough melt thick white covering earth james practiced men use snowshoes soon spring fairly commenced resumed work scouting 
done exercise fear humiliating failure french would time come attempt another expedition fort 
autumn general montcalm come france take command french troops 
superior officers french army cared take command country work hard rough little glory obtained 
therefore minister war able choose officer fitted post instead obliged usual fill appointment court favorite 
marquis montcalm born chateau candiac near nimes th february 
age fifteen time studied hard entered army 
two years later became captain first fire siege philipsbourg 
married mademoiselle du boulay brought influential connections property 
montcalm took part campaign bohemia 
two years later made colonel passed unharmed severe campaign 
following year fought campaign italy wounded disastrous action piacenza twice rallied regiment received five sabre cuts made prisoner 
soon liberated parole promoted following year rank brigadier general exchanged officer similar rank rejoined army wounded musket shot 
shortly afterwards peace aix la chapelle signed montcalm remained living quietly family tenderly attached informed minister war selected command troops north america rank major general 
chevalier de levis appointed second command 
sooner montcalm arrive america difficulties arose marquis de vaudreuil governor hoped received appointment commander french forces virtue office commanded canadian militia 
first last man opposed thwarted montcalm power injure reports france disfavor 
misfortunes befell france war slight degree due divided authority obstacles thrown way montcalm governor 
montcalm first blow english struck august six months attack fort william henry arranged vaudreuil 
three battalions regular troops canadians indians strong force artillery quietly concentrated fort frontenac intended attack upon important english post oswego 
fighting going neighborhood time oswego shirley intended act niagara frontenac 
enterprise fallen owing shirley deprived command sharp fight taken place colonel bradstreet armed boatmen french beaten 
oswego place extreme importance 
english post ontario situated towards southwest corner lake 
long remained possession standing menace whole line communications french south 
owing gross neglect fort never placed really defensive condition 
garrison small crippled fever carried great numbers 
remainder ill fed discontented 
th august earl london sent colonel webb th regiment bradstreet boatmen reinforce oswego 
started month done would time confusion misunderstanding arisen change command 
webb scarcely made half march tidings disaster met fell back greatest precipitation 
midnight th montcalm landed force within half league first english fort 
four cannon landed battery thrown careless danger garrison till morning invaders discovered 
two armed vessels sailed cannonade light guns match heavy artillery french forced retire 
attack commenced without delay 
indians canadians swarming forest round fort kept hot fire upon 
nightfall first parallel marked yards rampart 
fort ontario considered strongest three forts oswego stood high plateau right side river entered lake 
shape star formed palisade trunks trees set upright ground hewn flat sides closely fitted together excellent defense musketry worthless artillery 
garrison fort number eight small cannon mortar next day kept brisk fire battery french throwing arming twenty six pieces heavy artillery 
colonel mercer commandant oswego saw french artillery would soon opened fire blow stockade pieces thinking better lose fort alone fort garrison sent boats across river nightfall garrison spiked guns thrown ammunition well crossed river unperceived french 
oswego position defense 
fort pepperell stood mouth river facing fort ontario 
towards west south place protected outer line earthworks mounted cannon side facing river wholly exposed belief fort ontario would prevent attack direction 
montcalm lost time 
next evening whole force set work throwing battery edge rising ground fort ontario stood daybreak twenty heavy guns position opened fire 
grape round shot swept english position smashing mud built walls crashing stockades carrying destruction among troops 
latter made shelter pork barrels three high three deep planted cannon behind returned enemy fire canadians indians crossed river ford two miles soon opened fire sides 
colonel mercer bravely led men inspired example cut two cannon shot garrison seized despair 
council officers held garrison surrendered prisoners war number sixteen hundred included sick sailors belonging shipping labourers upwards hundred women 
montcalm greatest difficulty preventing indians means threats promises presents massacring prisoners 
oswego burned ground forts vessels stocks destroyed place made desert army returned prisoners spoil montreal 
loss oswego inflicted severe blow influence prestige england among indians lake districts partly restored failure french expedition william henry early following spring

loudon troops sailed back new york admiral holbourne joined four additional ships sailed louisbourg hopes french fleet would come fight 
cruised time port lamotte french admiral would come

nine dismasted others threw cannon sea 
lamotte sailed following day english fleet mercy 
fortunately holbourne returned england 
french canada aware loudon gathered troops new york preparing expedition aided fleet england thinking probable directed quebec vital point canada since occupation english would entirely cut colony france montcalm obliged keep forces hand near town unable take advantage unprotected state loudon left frontier colonies 
soon however despatch received france statements prisoners captured indians frontier montcalm learned expedition left new york destined louisbourg liberty utilize army invasion defenceless colonies determined commence campaign capture fort william henry 
james walsham company royal scouts spent spring fort william henry 
loudon first sent order corps broken men rejoin respective regiments accompany expedition earnest representations colonel monro th regiment command total inadequacy garrison defend serious attack made ticonderoga great value corps captain walsham thoroughly trained forest fighting induced countermand order 
james glad obliged rejoin regiment 
independent command pleasant one although life fort william henry since french repulse uneventful one plenty fishing lake shooting woods vary monotony drill 
edwards expert canoemen often ventured far lake taking one scouts keeping sharp lookout among woods either side signs enemy 
twice chased indian canoes always succeeded distancing

chapter scouting lake champlain 
one morning colonel monro sent james 
captain walsham said rumors french gathering crown point considerable force 
captain rogers still disabled wound band suffered heavily last affair enemy time action 
important learn truth rumors true must communicate general order may get together sufficient force relieve us montcalm comes lays siege fort 
undertake business best sir james replied 
propose take company picked party leave captain walsham

fifty men would useless purposes fighting enemy numerous number would hopeless attempt escape detection indians 
fewer better enterprise 
leaving commandant james summoned two hunters hut told mission received

rate may well go way 
like enough shall tramp back woods 
half hour later canoe put 
although little fear indian canoes would far lake george scarce word spoken boat hours starting 
jonathan always silent nat although talkative enough camp man words embarked upon serious expedition 
james little inclination conversation 
enterprise knew one extreme danger 
french force reconnoitre even one composed french canadians together would thought little knew redskins would roaming thickly forest ahead army much relied upon skill experience two scouts knew would difficult indeed elude watchful eyes 
thought letters writing wondered whether return tear whether would read home 
time thinking worked paddle vigorously high rate speed 
light canoe bounded noiselessly water impelled three vigorous pairs arms 
approached narrows connecting lake george lake champlain boat head directed towards shore could get past ticonderoga daylight broke likely good watch would kept narrows enemy would dangerous try effect landing 
canoe carried ashore hidden bushes lay sleep 
day broke nat rose went water see landing left mark upon shore might betray eye passing redskin 
going hands knees obliterated every sign footprints raised herbage upon trodden cut short ground stalks bruised broken passage confident safe returned camp 
became dark canoe carried replaced water continued passage 
james nat request laid paddle 
paddle wonderfully well captain 
say delicate piece work like one careful 
often hear paddle dip water hundred times see might cost us scalps 
got go along silent duck swimming 
speed object shall miles lake champlain daylight french know business half dozen canoes narrows prevent us scouting lake champlain see got advantage us cause got lie quiet listen got row

james accordingly lay quietly back boat companions took paddles 
necessary either look listen knew companions eyes ears quicker 
agreed starting go along close trees left hand side passage keenest lookout would kept right hand side would naturally chosen boat going farthest french fort 
fear whatever seen land nat said 
redskins would know well trouble look 
canoes got afraid chance 
might see us light waters middle trees make us thirty yards 
lying quiet shall either get past safe shall pretty nigh run 
chance nothing paddle noiselessly fish trust luck 
crossed lake left shore entered narrows 
paddles dipped quietly water even james could scarcely hear sound 
every strokes scouts stopped paddling altogether sat listening intently 
keeping close trees close times seemed james stretching hands could touch bushes 
hour paddling stopped longer usual 
james whispered jonathan ear nat taken bow paddle 
men ahead scout whispered back 
heard speak 
presently boat began move quietly looking dark masses boughs stretched overhead james knew boat motion 
jonathan crouched bottom boat placed hand nat shoulder sign 
time seemed endless james lay 
dark trees even see outline nat figure 
boat sure moving occasionally lay back grew lighter overhead passed openings trees 
suddenly heart gave bound nearly started guttural voice spoke seemingly within feet canoe 
placed hand rifle readiness sit fire still 
passing remark made one redskin another canoe sound right 
another long period passed jonathan sat took paddle james judged danger 
raising head could see nothing except vague light sheet water right 
boat still keeping close trees left shore lake lay back dozed sleep 
awoke jonathan touching foot 
take paddle captain 
sat looked round 
far broad sheet water 
faint lights fires burning low high left behind knew already passed ticonderoga making way along lake champlain 
paddled hours landed right hand side lake 
likely disturbed nat said lifted canoe water 
indians coming crown point would keep side lake 
make ticonderoga think keeping lookout anyone far lakes 
close shave canoe nat 
startled heard voice close us 
must within ten yards us 
nat said 
lucky spoke coming along 
expect watching nights much idea anyone would come else spoken 
easy enough pass dark night 
course looking outside kept along close could bushes giving light stroke take along 
inside got sight em distance away knew see us sharp eyes 
chance hearing noise hear felt safe enough caught sight em saw lying edge shadow 
close bushes ought fight seen till boats touched 
let lesson captain 
lookout canoe night lie among bushes 
must pass light see either grapple shoot like 
seen us hot time could hear calls right along side looking us earnest rifle fired half dozen canoes upon us time like enough leave boat take woods 
far crown point away ten miles nat said 
thirty miles ticonderoga 
lies point champlain widens 
reckon safest way tonight scout along side till well past point paddle well across lake come land left crown point 
shall track boats coming lower end lake paddle boldly 
one would keeping lookout way 
danger begin get ashore course must act according sarcumstances 
maneuver carried 
started soon became dark paddling along eastern shore nearly three hours struck wide lake till approached opposite shore heading south paddled boldly towards spot end sweep land seemed close lake stood french fort crown point 
starting two scouts stripped waist laid aside caps fastening strip leather round heads stuck feathers 
painted faces bodies

fortunately however precautions proved unnecessary 
canoes seen lake landed unnoticed spot mile half west crown point 
starting fort william henry james laid aside uniform dressed hunting shirt leggings similar worn scouts 
adopted various little details canadian hunters differed english side frontier 
latter wore hunting shirts loose indian fashion canadians generally wore leathern belt outside waist

simultaneously upset canoe half dozen rifles rang shore indian war whoop rose edge woods minute later half dozen canoes shot shore 
chapter many perils

sheering gradually lake although boat traveling somewhat faster pursuers james saw course would carry across bows dangerously close distance 
indians long seeing canoe outstripping boats one redskins laid aside paddle began fire 
balls struck water near canoe one hit 
let fire jonathan said 
every man shoot straight canoe going racing pace 
fires better 
fall behind 
firing two three shots indians appeared opinion resumed paddles lost much ground canoe chase shot lake fifty yards ahead nearest

turning canoe resting elbow knee steady rifle james took careful aim dancing motion boat permitted fired 
dull sound came back like echo crack piece paddle leading boat fell water 
yell arose indians answering shout came back 
indians paddling even harder hope overtaking canoe impelled two rowers 
scouts rowing hardest proved justice fame best paddlers lakes maintaining distance pursuers 
james fired several bullets taking effect

james laid rifle took paddle rowing top speed gradually increased distance pursuers 
rapidly gap water widened darkness fell lake fugitives half mile ahead pursuers 
night dark light mist rising water aided 
night set pursuing canoes could longer seen 
another half hour paddled without intermitting efforts james surprise nat turned head canoe western shore 
asked question however perfect faith nat sagacity 
nearly middle lake altered course took half hour hard paddling dark mass trees loomed darkness ahead 
ten minutes nat passed word paddle quietly noiselessly 
certain chase would eagerly watched shore indians might wood would closely watching near water edge 
accordingly noiselessly possible approached shore gliding overhanging trees laid canoe alongside clump bushes 
without word spoken laid paddles stretched full length canoe 
james glad rest trained hard muscles exhausted long strain row life 
guessed nat would calculate indian canoes would scatter lost sight would seek closely eastern shore 
time surprised getting sight pursuers nat immediately landed opposite shore started foot woods 
recovering breath james sat listened attentively 
twice thought heard sound dip paddle lake could sure time time heard croak frog sometimes near sometimes distance along shore 
would thought little slight pressure jonathan hand foot told indian signals 
hours passed nat made move touched jonathan sat canoe 
signal passed james paddles noiselessly taken without sound could detected closely listening ear canoe stole lake 
distance shore paddled quietly gradually strokes grew vigorous canoe flying along full speed lake course laid cross gradually towards eastern side 
james judged must several miles point started approached eastern shore 
precautions adopted side sat listening intently gave last strokes took shore 
quietly stepped two scouts lifting canoe shoulders carried fifty yards forest laid among bushes 
proceeded way nat walking first james following close able touch thick darkness trees could perceive even outlines figure 
jonathan followed close behind 
progress slow even trained woodsmen could difficulty make way trees nat index direction taken lay feel bark trunks

second three boats disappeared among trees colonel parker gave word rest advance body 
look firelocks lads james said 
whatever happens keep perfectly cool 
oars especially sit still ready obey orders 
boats within fifty yards trees beneath drooping boughs volley musketry poured moment later swarm canoes darted beneath branches terrible indian war whoop rang air

work destruction soon 
save company fifty provincials boats ahead whole colonel parker force killed prisoners hands indians finished work set pursuit boats escaped 
james changed order

canoes checked 
score paddlers sunk killed wounded bottom several frail barks upset 
fast men could load continued fire two minutes first shot canoes turned paddled full speed towards shore pursued hearty cheer english 
oars manned remains parker flotilla rowed lake fort william henry 
several prisoners taken indians cooked eaten 
days afterwards party indians following route head lake champlain made sudden attack houses round fort edward killed thirty two men 
imposing spectacle french expedition made way lake george 
general levis marched side lake twenty five hundred men canadians regulars redskins main body proceeded troops two hundred fifty large boats redskins many hundreds canoes 
boats moved military order 
six regiments french line la reine languedoc la sarre guienne bearn roussillon 
cannons carried platforms formed across two boats 
slowly regularly procession boats made way lake till saw signal fires levis command encamped near water distance two miles fort 
even english aware near eight thousand enemies gathered close 
monro brave soldier wholly unfitted position held knowing nothing irregular warfare despising trained soldiers 
daybreak bustle fort henry 
parties men went drive cattle others destroy buildings would interfere fire fort 
english position defensible attacked spring 
forest cleared considerable distance round buildings served screen enemy part removed 
fort lay close edge water 
one side rear protected marsh could attacked one side 
beyond marsh lay rough ground johnson encamped two years flat hill behind entrenched camp beyond another marsh 
soon sun rose column levis moved forest towards fort followed montcalm main body artillery boats put behind point hid sight english surrounded hundreds indian canoes moved slowly forward opening fire went 
soon sound firing broke near edge forest round fort indians levis opened fire upon soldiers endeavoring drive cattle 
hitherto james walsham edwards two scouts standing quietly watching approaching fleet boats canoes nat expressing measured terms utter disgust confusion reigned around fort 
looks like frontier settlement suddenly surprised said place filled soldiers weeks expecting attack 
nothing done nothing ready 
cattle place 
tents open ground still standing 
stores open 
pig headed obstinate ignorant old gentlemen ever see colonel beats 
one might well old woman command 
indeed know scores old women frontier would deal better 
monro obstinate prejudiced brave cool determined danger come felt secure ground took proper measures defense moving calmly abating disposition panic calm manner gave orders 
nat scarcely finished grumbling colonel approached 
captain walsham said take company cover parties driving cattle 
fall back see safety retire intrenched camp 
company already arms waiting orders double james led sloping ground towards forest whence war whoops indians sharp cracks rifles ringing sides 
james made spot score soldiers driving number cattle hurrying beasts across rough ground others firing indians numbers increased boldly showing behind trees advancing pursuit 
soon neared spot james scattered men skirmishing order 
placed behind one blackened stumps roughly cleared forest opened fire upon indians 
several fell rest bounded back forest whence opened heavy fire 
company showed advantage training gone fighting greatest steadiness coolness keeping well shelter soldiers cattle got well way towards fort james gave order fall back band crawling among stumps pausing fire every opportunity made way back without lost man although several received slight wounds 
chapter massacre fort william henry 
skirmishing round fort henry la corne body indians occupied road led fort edward levis encamped close support check sortie english might make intrenched camp 
montcalm reconnoitred position 
first intended attack carry intrenched camp found strong taken rush 
therefore determined attack fort regular approaches western side force levis would intercept succor might come fort edward cut retreat garrison direction 
gave orders cannon disembarked small cove half mile fort near placed main camp 
sent one aides de camp letter monro 
owe humanity said summon surrender 
present restrain savages make observe terms capitulation might power circumstances obstinate defense part could retard capture place days endanger unfortunate garrison relieved consequence dispositions made 
demand decisive answer within hour 
monro replied simply soldiers would defend till last 
trenches opened night th 
work extremely difficult ground covered hard stumps trees fallen trunks 
night long men toiled work guns fort kept constant fire round shot grape daybreak first parallel made 
battery left nearly finished one right begun 
men working shelter guns fort could little harm 
french soldiers worked indians crept fallen trees close fort fired garrison might moment expose 
sharpshooters fort replied fire day fort fringed light puffs smoke whilst cannon thundered unceasingly 
next morning french battery left opened eight heavy cannon mortar following morning battery right joined eleven pieces 
fort mounted seventeen cannon part small upon faces english fire although kept spirit could reply weakly french 
fort composed embankments gravel surmounted rampart heavy logs laid tiers crossing interstices filled earth could ill support heavy cannonade exposed 
roar distant artillery continuing day day plainly audible fort edward although monro commencement attack sent several messengers asking reinforcements webb move 
third day siege received men new york stripping forts could advanced men deserters french told montcalm men webb considered task advancing intervening forests defiles fort henry far dangerous operation attempted 
undoubtedly would dangerous one indians pervaded woods far fort edward 
messenger could got inform monro coming montcalm could therefore attacked march greater part force 
still brave determined general would made attempt 
webb left monro fate 
even added certainty sending letter telling could nothing assist advising surrender 
messenger killed indians forest note taken montcalm learning webb intend advance able devote whole attention fort 
montcalm kept letter several days till english rampart half battered sent officer monro hoping would induce latter surrender 
old soldier however remained firm determination hold even though position absolutely hopeless 
trenches pushed forward within yards fort indians crept almost wall side 
two sorties made one fort intrenched camp repulsed loss 
defenders killed wounded 
smallpox raging casemates crowded sick 
large cannon burst disabled seven small pieces fit service 
french battery foremost trench almost completed done whole montcalm thirty one cannon fifteen mortars would open fire breach already effected wall resistance would madness 
night th known fort council war would held morning undoubtedly fort would surrender 
james company escorting cattle fort crossed marsh intrenched camp fort already crowded troops 
company therefore avoided horrors siege 
report circulated surrender would probably made next morning nat went james 
going captain nat nothing 
monro council decide surrender end 
propose company fight montcalm army alone nat said testily deal much fighting already 
understand holding till last hope somebody coming relieve use fighting getting lot men killed raising blood redskin devils boiling point colonel given place saved loss men montcalm would glad enough let us march fort edward 
probably agree let us james said 
may agree nat said contemptuously redskins think losing lot braves going see us march quietly away go home without scalp tell captain know redskin nature sure sun rises tomorrow massacre one going lay rifle let first redskin takes fancy scalp tomahawk 
well propose nat well captain heard say independent command act company wherever like 
know orders colonel chosen march away expedition could done 
nat siege begun know justified marching away even could 
going surrender tell nat insisted 
see duty hand company french get clear away fight king 
say edwards james asked lieutenant 
see march away could edwards said 
game quite lost think anyone could blame saving company possible agree nat montcalm find difficult impossible keep indians hand 
french never troubled much score

got march quietly lake take canoes hauled mouth swamp paddle quietly keeping trees right hand side 
many redskins woods way night dark pitch 
land eight ten miles lake march away right get clean round redskins altogether 
well nat james said 
chance think better chance staying get row help 
best 
corps quietly mustered marched gate intrenchments side lake 
questions asked corps several times gone account driven back indians french pickets 
men first arrival fort laid aside heavy boots taken moccasins better fitted silent movement forest 
therefore sound heard nat guidance made way slope swamp 
halted moment told move greatest care silence avoid snapping bough twig 
however less important cannon sides still firing constant rattle musketry going round fort 
presently reached point canoes hauled told three canoe 
follow canoe single file james said 
word spoken remember single splash paddle bring redskins upon us 
likely enough may canoes upon lake sure indians wood 
think much fear captain nat whispered 
tiring redskin scout account acting whites lazy hog must sure fort hold many hours longer busy feasting counting scalps mean take think much scouting tonight 
shall go slowly 
let every man stop paddling instant canoe ahead stops james last instructions stepped stern canoe nat jonathan took paddles 
edwards take place last canoe line 
without slightest sound canoes paddled lake made east shore 
soon close trees slowly noiselessly kept way outside screen afforded boughs drooping almost water 
slightest splash heard along line might well taken spring tiny fish feeding 
several times thought heard slight sound forest right nat ceased paddling lay minutes motionless canoes behind 
dark could scarce see trees close beside bright flashes guns fort batteries seemed make darkness intense 
upwards hour james felt greater speed canoe traveling nat believed got beyond spot indians likely watching forest 
faster faster boat glided along scouts still far rowing hardest 
although whole men accustomed use paddle boats would unable keep driven practiced arms leaders file 
paddling another hour half scout stopped 
far enough away nat said 
chance world redskins woods far 
hope scalps taken close fort 
land safely 
word passed line canoes boats glided screen foliage men landed 
better pull canoes ashore captain 
left water one might break adrift float beyond trees 
redskin would make troop trail hour passed 
marching forest nat james said 
see hand close face 
captain best halt till daylight 
could make way along easy enough fellows would pitching stumps catching feet creeper like enough letting pieces went 
may well stay 
likely miss us even camp sartin redskins known gone 
chance whatever pursuit nothing gained making haste 
james gave order 
men felt till found space ground sufficiently large lie upon soon asleep except two scouts said would watch turns till daylight 
soon sufficiently light see forest band motion 
made due east crossed trail leading head lake champlain fort edward kept another hour turning south made direction albany would dangerous approach fort edward round indians sure scattered thickly 
first two hours starting distant roar guns gone unceasingly suddenly stopped 
hoisted white flag edwards said 

thank god well mind fighting walsham massacred indians hideous idea 
glad james agreed think montcalm large force french regulars command allow fiendish indians massacre prisoners 
hope edwards said 
disgrace indeed officers know indians better heard nat opinion 
see montcalm use force indians whole would go would end hope french beating colonists long run 
montcalm daren break 
horrible position officer gentleman placed 
montcalm manage prevent redskins massacring garrison oswego much could ten times difficult blood week hard fighting loss many warriors 
anyhow glad even bigwigs consider right leave fort break us 
would rather lose commission run risk massacred cold blood 
james agreed 
two days continued march forest using every precaution surprise 
saw however nothing enemy emerged forest evening second day march distance miles albany 
reached town many hours learned nat sombre predictions fulfilled 
council war fort agreed resistance impossible lieutenant colonel young went white flag arrange terms surrender montcalm 
agreed english troops march honors war escorted fort edward detachment french troops serve eighteen months french prisoners captured america since war began given within three months 
stores ammunition artillery handed french except one field piece garrison allowed retain recognition brave defense 
signing capitulation montcalm summoned indian chiefs asked consent conditions restrain young braves disorder 
gave approval promised maintain order 
garrison evacuated fort marched join comrades intrenched camp 
sooner moved crowd indians rushed fort breach embrasures butchered wounded left behind cared french 
committed atrocity indians many canadians rushed intrenched camp english collected 
french guards stationed nothing keep wandered threatening insulting terrified women telling men everyone massacred plundering baggage 
montcalm best entreaty restrain indians took steps whatever give effectual protection prisoners remain ineffaceable blot upon fame 
seeing disposition redskins ordered regular french troops marched english garrison protection fort edward accordance terms surrender allowed english troops fill pouches cartridge means would able fight defense 
next morning english marched daybreak 
seventeen wounded men left behind huts accordance agreement handed charge french surgeon morning regimental surgeon miles whitworth remained attending wants 
french surgeon caused special sentinels placed protection removed needed 
five morning indians entered huts dragged inmates tomahawked scalped eyes whitworth presence la corne canadian officers well french guard stationed within forty feet spot none whitworth declared oath anything protect wounded men 
indians meantime begun plunder baggage column 
monro complained officers french escort terms capitulation broken answer better give baggage indians appease 
effect restraining passion indians 
rushed upon column snatching caps coats weapons men officers tomahawking resisted seizing upon shrieking women children carried away murdered spot 
rush made upon new hampshire men rear column eighty killed carried away 
canadian officers nothing try assuage fury indians officers canadian detachment formed advance guard french escort refused protection men telling better take woods shift 
montcalm principal french officers everything short effectual step namely ordering french regular troops save english 
ran among yelling indians imploring desist vain 
seven eight hundred english seized carried savages seventy eighty massacred spot 
column attempted resistance

resistance offered doubt would massacred indians 
many fugitives ran back fort took refuge montcalm recovered indians four hundred carried

morning massacre indians left body montreal taking two hundred prisoners tortured murdered return villages 
events cast deeper disgrace arms france massacre committed defiance pledged honor safety prisoners sight four thousand french troops man set motion prevent 
facts taken english sources letters french officers journal jesuit roubaud charge christianized indians according account less ferocious cruel unconverted tribes 
number perished massacre uncertain 
captain jonathan carver colonial officer puts killed captured 
french writer whose work published montreal says killed except seven hundred captured course gross exaggeration 
general levis roubaud certain made best matter acknowledged saw fifty corpses scattered ground include murdered fort camp 
probably total number killed two hundred besides must counted two hundred prisoners carried tortured indians 
greater portion purchased indians exchange rum vaudreuil governor montreal eternal disgrace man suffered many carried even interfere publicly sight whole town indians murdered prisoners content eating forced comrades partake flesh 
bougainville one aides de camp montcalm present testified fact story confirmed intendant bigot friend governor
