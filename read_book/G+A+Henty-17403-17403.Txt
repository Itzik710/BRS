whole time marked escape prison exercise 
try last first think 
long time rupert worked away furniture quite exhausted feeling happier better done since shut began think plans escape 
easiest way would course knock gag gaoler escape clothes plan put aside morally certain nearer escape reaching courtyard prison cell

chance widening narrow loophole removing bars without detection extreme besides rupert strong idea loophole looked courtyard 
finally came conclusion escape made must raising flag floor tunnelling room underneath working solid wall 
would tremendous work loophole showed wall must ten feet thick still said least something think even takes five years comes nothing useful 
thus resolved rupert went work labored steadily 
exercise chair table succeeded admirably six months able perform feats strength surprised 
scheme escape less fortunate 
either tools faulty stones work upon compact well built beyond getting flag making hole hard cement filled space floor large enough bury good sized cat rupert achieved nothing 
gone prison november august fast coming idea loches broken way attempting
