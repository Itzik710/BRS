listen good de marmont said recollect last april empress poor wretched misguided woman fled precipitately paris abandoning capital france crown one time taking away crown diamonds money treasure belonging emperor terribly ill advised course yes remember perfectly well broke de marmont impatiently 
well know abominable talleyrand sent one emissaries empress suite emissary dudon name reached orleans marie louise got ordered talleyrand name seizure empress convoy soon arrived city broke de marmont 
yes 
recollect abominable outrage perfectly 
dudon backed officers gendarmerie managed rob empress everything even last knife fork even last pocket handkerchief belonging emperor marked initials 
oh monstrous hellish devilish makes blood boil whenever think whenever think fatuous treacherous bourbons gloating treasures tuileries empress went way effectually despoiled waylaid many brigands public highway 
resumed emery quietly de marmont violent storm wrath subsided

fatuous bourbons rightly call expected find forty fifty millions emperor personal savings bank notes drafts banks france england amsterdam looking forward distributing among friends 
friend comte de cambray would doubt come share distribution 
de talleyrand wise man always far seeing knows improvidence prodigality ostentation new masters ready serve 
ere dudon reached paris booty de talleyrand carefully eliminated therefrom five twenty million francs bank notes bankers drafts felt would come usefully rainy day 
de talleyrand immensely rich protested de marmont

grenoble reasserted emery 
long way grenoble queried young man obvious puzzlement 
several reasons replied emery

ways tortuous mere army surgeon possibly hope gauge 
enough moment five twenty millions rightful property emperor locked cellars h tel de ville grenoble

oh fourier sufficiently astute

go mr clyffurde seek quarrel marquis de st genis already struck face doubt ready 
clyffurde thoughts woman loved strength lonely heart poured forth hideous insults upon amazement wrath bewilderment final hopelessness sensations ran riot brain 
st genis behaved like abominable blackguard gathered said lied like mean skunk betrayed man rendered infinitely great service 
clyffurde even think despicable crawling worms exist god earth knew possessed happy faculty sunny disposition able pass worm ignore existence keeping eyes fixed upon beautiful earth sky 
st genis therefore would think day perhaps might able punish poor forlorn heartsick girl pinned implicit faith upon wretched worm bestowed priceless guerdon love

said slowly speaking mature deliberation raising voice yet allowing quiver stress latent emotion 
yet something tone something man attitude suggested depth passion quite instinctively comte remained silent awed 
moment however clyffurde seemed forgotten older man presence wounded every fiber woman loved tenderly devotedly spoken compelling attention stirring even simple admission despicable crime emotion could would define

presently closed eyes gray monotonous light one brief moment felt deliciously conscious sweet protecting presence somewhere near soft whisperings fondness friendship sound dream voice reached ear sweet scented alcove felt murmuring calls heard tender wailing stricken soul pain poor heart broken wretch could keep away side 
memory echoes lingered round bringing back every sound mellow voice every look eyes touch hand oh exquisite touch last words asked dance every drop blood every nerve every sinew every thought love 
heart long drawn moan unconquerable sorrow sent still morning air agonised call reply come back love come back live without taught love pure selfless protecting go

smiled friend contempt harshness look great consoling pity something seemed like appeal yes longer looked blue eyes sure appeal 
almost seemed needed way never needed 
apparently could speak could tell wanted little hands seemed draw trodden trampled corn soothed aches pains seemed impel something important imperative something wanted done 
begged let lie peace comforted happy 
quite sure dead sweet face last tangible vision seen earth ere closed eyes last long sleep 
seen gone 
sudden vanished darkness closing around scent roses faded air filled horrid sounds deafening roar cannon sharp incessant retort rifle fire awesome l e cries groans bugle calls sighs agony one deafening cry like last wail departing souls came somewhere far away vive l empereur bobby raised sitting posture 
head ached terribly stiff every limb burning almost intolerable pain gnawed thigh left arm 
consciousness returned knowledge day meant round broken corn stained blood mud round lay dead dying thousands 
far away west crimson glow like fire lit vast hecatomb brave lives sacrificed final agony vast empire might grandeur one man laid low day mightier hand god 
lit weird light dying day pallid clean shaven faces gallant british boys rugged faces scot olive skin child provence bronzed cheeks old veterans threw lurid glow red coats black coats white facings gilt epaulettes drew sparks still living fire breastplates broken swords discarded casques bayonets sabretaches kilts bugles drums dead horses arms accoutrements dead dying men lying pell mell huge litter glow midsummer sunset upon poor little chessmen pawns knights castles strength kings lonely mourning hearts swept together almighty hand great master terrestrial game 
returning consciousness bobby gaze took wider range vision 
visualised exactly south slope mont saint jean la haye sainte ahead little left whitewashed walls la belle alliance still away gleaming golden light setting sun 
saw wide road leads genappe charleroi invincible cavalry mighty emperor fleeing helter skelter scene disaster saw british left hot pursuit saw far plancenoit scintillating casques bl cher prussians 
left detachment allied troops dutch belgian brunswickers started slope plateau join death dealing pell mell amongst litter dead dying confusion pursuer pursued comrade fought times comrade brother fired brother prussian british 
behind farm buildings la haye sainte two battalions chasseurs old guard made stand around tattered bit tricolor bronze eagle symbol much decadent grandeur undying glory 
moi chasseurs brave g n ral pelet cried 
let us save eagle die beneath wing 
heard last call despair stopped headlong flight forged way mass running horses men rallied flag tirailleurs kneeling one knee ranged circle round formed living bulwark eagle dauntless breasts bristling bayonets 
upon mass desperate men small body raw dutch belgian german troops hurled wild huzzas blind impetuousness 
mass heroes conquerors dozen victorious campaigns men longer anything lose life life meant less nothing handful half trained recruits drunk cry victory drowned roar cannon clash sabres drunk vision glory awaited defiant eagle brought earth bobby staggered feet already saw impending catastrophe one many day cumulative disasters 
saw dutch belgians brunswickers rush wildly charge young men enthusiasts brave men whose ranks twice broken day twice rallied colors broken men exhausted men none ably led men fact many french royalists among officers physical power endurance enabled british astonish world day 
bobby could see amongst brunswickers black coats would known amongst millions men 
full brilliance evening glow upon black coats silver galoons tassels two officers made brave show brussels three days hundred years ago duchess richmond ball 
bobby remembered well one two officers maurice de st genis 
oh crystal would love see even though dear heart would torn anxiety fighting bravely bravely desperately every one fought day chasseurs old guard remained fighting still even hour round tattered flag bronze eagle cry vive l empereur dying upon lips 
despair indeed sides even hour merest incident might yet turn issue world conflict one way 
bobby steadied feet seen attack already turning rout 
pelet chasseurs held dutch brunswickers bay tirailleurs made deadly havoc among assailants latter threatened absolute annihilation even whilst around allies british prussian crying victory bobby could see quite clearly saw subtle delicate sense great pure passion give saw danger moment born precise instant threatened handful black coated men one whose officers named st genis 
saw first sign wavering stupefaction followed impetuous charge saw gaps ranks initial deadly volley tirailleurs 
almost seemed could hear shouts vive l empereur rallying cry commanding officers near three hundred yards away clear stormy atmosphere carried sights sounds upon wing 
another volley tirailleurs dutch brunswickers turned fly vain officers call wanted get away tried fly run chasseurs bayonets tried run ground littered wounded dead wounded dead long day carnage stumbled every step fell dying wounded dead wounded horses piles guns swords bayonets sabretaches forsaken guns broken carriages litter impeded front even driven bayonet rear 
bobby saw coming pursued pursuers fast ever could coming flying black coated men casting away gay trappings well arms trying run get away stumbling falling time picking falling running 
one short moment whole brief tragedy enacted eyes bobby also saw vision equally swift fleeting blue eyes crystal drowned tears 
saw fair head drooping like lily saw quiver lips heard moan pain would come lips man loved brought home dead 
second full portent bobby understood sweet image called help 
called beckoned blue eyes looked appeal compelling two dear hands clasped begged friend 
visions come god man sees save whose soul great whose heart pure 
poor bobby clyffurde lonely heart broken desolate saw exquisite face would loved kiss saw golden glow evening upon delicate cheeks lurid light fire battle upon soft fair hair 
greatness love helped understand life still held happiness supreme sacrifice 
around death life one two poor abandoned riderless horses quietly picking bits corn piles dead dying men standing sniffing air dilated nostrils snorting terror deafening noise 
bobby steadied neither head limbs aching rate forgotten remembered saw black coated brunswickers longed fly could slaughtered like insects even stumbled fled 
bobby caught bridle one poor terror stricken beasts stood snorting sniffing far away crawled saddle thigh numb one arms helpless 
horseback could get along trampled corn dead toward hideous corner behind farm la haye sainte desperate men butchering others desperate among seething crowd black coats fur bonnets silver tassels brass eagles whirlpool swords bayonets gun fire tirailleurs seen man crystal loved whose sake would eat heart mourning regret 
deafening noise shrieking sighs whizzing bullets cries agony heard crystal voice telling 
already seen st genis struggling knees fifty tres away first line tirailleurs hundred advancing steel wall fixed bayonets 
maurice thrown back head hopelessness despair evening sun fell full upon haggard blood stained face upon wide open eyes filled terror death 
next moment bobby clyffurde side around bullets whizzing around men sighed last sigh agony 
stooped saddle pull called 
one sound arm caught maurice elbow helped struggle feet 
horse dazed terror snorted smell blood move 
maurice equally dazed scrambled saddle almost inert dead weight thing impeded progress movement thing crystal loved things earth bobby knew must wrest devouring jaws death lay safe sound within shelter arms 
iv meant struggle life indeed cared little enough sake burden carrying burden infinite preciousness since crystal heart happiness bound 
maurice de st genis clung half inert one hand gripping saddle bow clutching bobby belt convulsive tenacity 
bobby half conscious dazed pain wounds exertion hoisting dead weight across saddle deafening noise whizzing bullets round boring frightened horse bridle tried pick way tangled heaps upon ground 
every moment lessened danger stray bullets chance bayonet charge behind 
cries vive l empereur round still standing eagle drowned medley confusion hundreds sounds 
bobby able guide horse away spots fighting hot fierce vivian hussars attacked two battalions cuirassiers adam brigade artillery turned flank chasseurs laid proud bronze eagle low ney old guard showing rest grand army grizzled veterans fought died 
rode straight plateau however well right picking way carefully blind instinct tracked beast possesses hunted man sometimes receives god 
dead dying less thick upon ground 
earlier day dutch belgians brunswickers supported british left terrific cavalry charges british endurance tenacity alone able withstand 
hacke cumberland hussars broken ranks fled taking brussels thence ghent news terrific disaster 
bobby lips tight set snorted like war horse thought thought misery sorrow must reigning brussels consternation ghent poor old bourbon king probably mourning dead hopes vanished throne 
brussels women would weeping crystal forlorn desolate would perhaps sitting window watching stream fugitives came wounded exhausted field battle recounting tales catastrophe parallel modern times crystal seeing hearing would think man loved believing dead would break heart sorrow 
bobby thought spurred fresh effort pulled together desperate tension every nerve sinew fighting exhaustion ignoring pain conjuring vision crystal blue eyes pleading look begged save lifelong sorrow anguish future loneliness 
longer heard weird incessant cannonade longer saw desolation utter confusion around longer felt exhausted weight lifeless impeding burden upon saddle bow 
stray bands fugitives pursuers hot heels passed stray bullets flew right left whizzing eerie whistling sound outskirts great pursuit anon reached crest mont saint jean last almost blindly struck back eastward direction forest soigne 
blind instinct nothing kept horse clung saddle half paralysed knees drowning man clutch floating bit wreckage helps keep head water 
stately trees soigne far ahead forest track bore left would strike brussels road little strength another effort two cool solitude wood would ease weight burden throbbing nerves brain 
setting sun shone full upon leafy edge wood hazelnut beech oak clumps briar rose quivered rough kiss wind blew straight across lowland southwest bringing still confusion sounds weird cannonades dismal bugle calls strange contrast rustle leaves crackling tiny twigs tangled coppice 
cool delicious must trees narrow track must lead straight brussels road ground looked soft mossy damp rain oh strength reach leafy shadows plunge thicket brush burning forehead soft green leaves heavy moisture oh power annihilate distance hundred yards lie immense graveyard open wind scorching sun green cool moss carpet twigs leaves soft sweet smelling earth weary body desolate soul might find eternal rest v forest soigne question yet rest 
maurice yet wakened trance 
bobby vaguely wondered already dead
