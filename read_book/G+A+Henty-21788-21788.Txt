consider duelling foolish practice use one person standing crowd 
fashion days fight duels therefore almost necessity gentleman able shoot straight besides although might able avoid fighting duel countrymen possibility getting become involved quarrel foreigner

believe plenty sound sense somewhere head association number young military men bad effect upon four five years abroad less rather inclined settle business 
regard son indeed relations care way except sister

reason bob chiefly wish succeed business 
good one 
doubt whether merchant imports large quantities wines 
next years shall endeavor give far may call private business deal entirely trade 
time difficult give customers dealt father

entering arrangements several travellers purpose extending dealings trade provinces comes hands find compact time extensive 
glad past four months 
eye upon closely suppose pleased see worked well willingly far expected 
much encouraged hope time settle business contented lead purposeless idle life 
happiest man opinion something yet much free anxieties regarding view business occupation pleasure master slave 
thinking giving mr medlin small interest business 
mean make real effort break little loose seen enough know make valuable junior 
little eccentric perhaps sort exaggeration shall signify comes firm consider advantage import little may call extra official manner 
business well aware although possess certain cheerfulness disposition generally pleasing manner advantage 
buyers apt give larger orders otherwise would influence pleasant genial relations mr medlin chooses make deficiencies way 
taking step rather interest 
relieve considerable portion burden business enable relax somewhat disposed partner place thorough confidence 
wish mention matter

go another fishing expedition together think approach pleasant footing could 
modelled thoroughly upon matter could approached intensely businesslike way feel sure arrive anything like satisfactory arrangement might elsewhere

frigate keeps course steering last saw go two miles south us lugger go north 
hold night hull morning shall windward wind light frigate would never catch us know lugger reduced sails 
minutes sails lowered brig lay motionless 
next two hours closest watch kept nothing seen pursuing vessels 
fancy frigate must altered course south captain said thinking lugger north likely haul wind direction 
wait another hour get sail lay head cape ortegal

three craft two miles away 
sailing mr crofts fancy xebec fastest sir 
astern abreast polacre near make 
ship brig whichever seems dropping astern 
heave away anchor joe 
get slack ready hoist soon breeze reaches us 
want come us 
line taking carry nearly half mile outside us fortunate 
run six guns throw tarpaulin eighteen pounder 
three guns side enough us show 
breeze caught three spanish craft nearly abeam 
wind shall captain said advantage want run away 
get anchor joe 
take many hands

dare attack daylight mount many guns us altogether 
big fellow got twelve side polacre eight xebec six fifty two guns 
might try well sea would never 
may galleys gunboats within hearing must bide time 
think luck time joe 
ship must come foreign least say appearance though may cadiz 
two may anything 
xebec doubt coast trader 
polacre may one thing another hardly think come across atlantic 
likely enough bilbao santander 
ship fellow get hold get chance 
shall quite content leave others alone 
think joe agreed 
ship ought valuable prize wherever comes 
sound pretty new would fetch good sum get english port 
wind continued hold light four vessels made slow progress water 
two leaders however gradually improved position 
nearly matched point sailing captains evidently making race hoisting every stitch canvas able show 
afternoon fully two miles ahead ship half mile starboard bow brig 
wind died away nothing sun set 
three spanish vessels edging towards shore polacre anchored sunset 
ship held another hour mile astern two also dropped anchor 
sail towing overboard brig got board wind began drop come within little quarter mile ship 
anchor let go soon seen crew ship preparing anchor brig first 
whether suspicions board spaniards character brig could tell watching closely captain lockett saw order anchor countermanded soon seen brig done 
minutes men went forward anchor dropped vessel making way whatever water 
well joe close 
question next wind would simple enough 
would drop alongside middle watch carry boarding dons time get hammocks 
question course think towing 
still night would hear slightest noise 
might attack boats mate said 
yes would possible watch would hear oars instant began row 
see number guns carries must strongly manned 
expect small joe said meant show rather use 
likely enough may taken half board cadiz malaga give formidable appearance case fall craft description 
come across atlantic would never carried anything like number guns spain war anyone 
craft flying black flag still found waters joe might carry guns defense 
question guns present question crew 
likely carries many could get alongside would fear like risk losing half men attack craft like unless advantage surprise 
say swimming soon gets quite dark captain bob said 
good swimmer 
used bathe regularly putney school swum across thames back lots times 
sure little mist water presently keeping sharp lookout till gets later 
get hold cable climb get bow lookout see going 
danger thing discovered got dive swim back 
current speak least chance hitting dark 
certainly able learn something listening talk 
would risky thing bob captain lockett said shaking head 
like let though course would great thing could learn something 
like appearance though say 
somehow think right 
either guns mere pretence weak handed must carry big crew 
well see possible harm trying get board captain 
course hailed approach shall turn come back 
night dark shall difficulty finding talking noise board 
well joe think captain said doubtfully 
think might let bob try joe said 
mind trying speak spanish able learn nothing 
likely setting watch keeping sharp lookout time think might possibly get board unobserved 
make keep diving dark would little chance hitting 
besides certainly make swimmer 
noticed ripple water would sure think fish sort
